      "content": "Sub-Saharan Africa’s water-energy systems are deeply interconnected yet operationally fragmented, creating a critical barrier to climate resilience. With 32.4% lacking safe water and 53.3% without electricity (World Bank), the region faces acute vulnerability. Recent climate droughts have reduced water availability by 40% in East Africa, threatening 200 million people with food insecurity.\n\nThis interdependence forms a vicious cycle: water scarcity limits hydropower generation, while energy poverty hampers water treatment. For instance, 78% of Kenya’s water projects require electricity, but only 22% of rural areas have grid access.\n\nThis policy brief identifies urgent actions: strengthening cross-sectoral coordination, prioritizing renewable energy integration, and establishing dedicated funding mechanisms. Aligning water and energy policies within 18 months can unlock cost savings, improve service delivery, and advance SDGs 6 and 7 while building climate resilience.",
