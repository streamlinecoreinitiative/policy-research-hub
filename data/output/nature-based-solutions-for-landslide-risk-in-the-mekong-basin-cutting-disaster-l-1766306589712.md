# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong basin: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Mekong Basin: Enhancing Climate Resilience**

**Executive Summary**

The Mekong Basin is one of the most disaster-prone regions globally, with landslides posing a significant threat to vulnerable communities. Climate change exacerbates these risks through altered precipitation patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events. This brief highlights nature-based solutions that can mitigate landslide risk in the region.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mekong Basin**

The Mekong Basin faces severe water scarcity due to climate change characterized by erratic rainfall patterns. [Verify] Average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm, with precipitation variability of [verify] annually. Traditional irrigation systems exacerbate this issue.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, further entrenching poverty among smallholder farmers. Borehole pumps consume significant amounts of energy, while canal systems lose water to evaporation and seepage.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it more resilient to climate change impacts. Benefits of agroforestry include:

* Improved soil organic matter
* Increased biodiversity (case studies from West Africa and East Africa demonstrate successful implementation)
* Enhanced carbon sequestration

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Specific data includes:

* Power generation: [verify] kW per system
* Energy efficiency: [verify]%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. Key data points include:

* Total project cost: $[verify]-$25,000 per hectare
* Return on investment (ROI): [verify] years

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Policy Support:** Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Capacity Building:** Training programs and workshops are necessary to educate smallholder farmers on the benefits and implementation of these nature-based solutions.
3. **Infrastructure Development:** Governments should invest in infrastructure development, including roads and storage facilities, to support the scaling up of these integrated systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Mekong Basin is at a critical juncture in addressing landslide risk through climate-resilient irrigation solutions. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising approach that can address both water security and renewable energy needs while reducing disaster losses for vulnerable groups. By supporting policy measures, capacity building initiatives, and infrastructure development, we can create an enabling environment for the adoption of these nature-based solutions.
