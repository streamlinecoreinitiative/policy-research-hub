**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and rising temperatures. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

**Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity**

The region experiences significant precipitation variability, with limited data on average annual rainfall. Climate change exacerbates these conditions, leading to severe water scarcity. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and inefficient, resulting in:

* Evaporation: [verify]%
* Seepage: [verify]%

These losses can be mitigated through integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation methods in the region include borehole pumps and canal systems. These methods are energy-intensive and economically burdensome:

* Borehole pumps: Energy consumption of [verify] kWh/day
* Canal systems: Water loss due to evaporation ([verify]%) and seepage ([verify]%)

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration:

* Soil organic matter: [verify]% (range not specified)
* Biodiversity increase: [verify]% (range not specified)
* Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions:

* Power generation: [verify] kW per system
* Energy efficiency: [verify]%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrating these solutions for cost-effective, sustainable outcomes:

* Total project cost: $[verify]-$[verify] per hectare
* Return on investment (ROI): [verify] years
* Long-term sustainability assessments

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Create supportive policy environments for sustainable solutions:

* Incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Incorporate Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Systems into NDCs:** Support the adoption of these solutions in national climate action plans.
2. **Establish Incentives for Farmers:** Offer subsidies and low-interest loans to encourage farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Invest in Infrastructure Development:** Develop roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure necessary for large-scale implementation.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems presents a promising solution for climate-resilient irrigation in the Lower Mekong delta. By addressing immediate water scarcity issues and contributing to broader sustainable development goals, this approach can help mitigate the impacts of climate change in vulnerable regions like the Lower Mekong delta.

Changes made:

* Removed speculative claims that are not evidence-backed.
* Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
* Preserved the title, which is specific and consistent with the outline.
* Kept length similar to the original draft.
