# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Mekong Basin: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To mitigate the devastating impact of climate-related disasters on vulnerable communities in the Mekong Basin, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives that integrate clean energy sources and water management practices. This approach can reduce disaster losses by [VERIFY] within three years (World Bank, 2022). We urge governments, NGOs, and development practitioners to invest $500 million in renewable energy projects and water management initiatives, leveraging the African Development Bank's (AfDB) existing commitment of $1 billion to support clean energy projects.

## Context & Challenge

The Mekong Basin is home to over [VERIFY] people who rely heavily on agriculture for their livelihoods. However, climate change is exacerbating droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, threatening the region's food security and economic stability (World Bank, 2020). The lack of access to clean energy and safe drinking water further compounds these challenges, with only [32.4%] of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024).

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Only [32.4%] of the Mekong Basin's population has access to safely managed drinking water, leading to health risks and socioeconomic disparities (World Bank Open Data, 2024).
- **Clean Energy Access**: Despite a global renewable energy consumption rate of [19.7%], only [53.3%] of the region’s population has access to electricity, highlighting significant gaps in infrastructure development (World Bank Open Data, 2023).
- **Climate Adaptation**: Frequent floods, droughts, and other climate-related events threaten livelihoods and exacerbate existing water scarcity issues.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Partner with local communities to establish cooperatives that integrate clean energy sources (such as solar power) and water management practices (like rainwater harvesting). This will reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance water security.
2. **Invest in Renewable Energy Projects**: Allocate $500 million for renewable energy projects, such as solar power plants and hydroelectric facilities, to reduce carbon emissions from critical sectors.
3. **Enhance Water Management Practices**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems and improve water distribution networks to ensure equitable access to safe drinking water.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Analysis**: Estimate costs for implementing renewable energy projects and water management initiatives using AfDB data ($1 billion for solar power plants, $50 million for rainwater harvesting systems). Assess potential cost savings from reduced healthcare expenses due to improved water quality.
- **Potential Barriers**: Identify political resistance and institutional barriers. Engage with local governments and communities through community-led development projects to build support and ensure sustainability.

## Conclusion

By establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, investing in renewable energy projects, and enhancing water management practices, the Mekong Basin can significantly reduce disaster losses and improve its environmental resilience. This approach not only aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 6 but also fosters broader economic growth and social stability. Immediate action is needed to address these pressing challenges effectively.
