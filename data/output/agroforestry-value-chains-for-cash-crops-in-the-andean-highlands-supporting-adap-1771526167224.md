# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Andean highlands: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Strengthening Water Security, Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Immediate policy interventions are needed to address the triple challenge of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa. To bridge this gap, we recommend investing $10 billion annually in water infrastructure projects such as rainwater harvesting systems, boreholes, and pipelines (UNEP). Additionally, promoting renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can increase access to electricity while reducing carbon emissions (IRENA). Implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices and agroforestry value chains for cash crops will also enhance the region's resilience to climate change.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 54 countries with limited resources and infrastructure. Despite progress in certain areas, such as electricity access at [53.3%] (World Bank Open Data), the region still struggles with water security and energy poverty. Only [32.4%] of Sub-Saharan African populations have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), which has significant implications for health outcomes and economic development.

The situation is further complicated by climate change, leading to erratic weather patterns and increased frequency of droughts and floods. This not only affects agricultural productivity but also exacerbates energy shortages due to the breakdown or damage of infrastructure during extreme weather events.

## Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's inadequate access to safe drinking water has far-reaching consequences:

* **Health Risks**: Poor sanitation leads to diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery. For example, in 2019, the WHO reported [485 million] cases of diarrheal diseases worldwide, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for more than half (WHO).
* **Economic Impact**: Water scarcity affects agricultural productivity, leading to food insecurity and increased poverty rates. In Niger, for instance, a study found that water stress reduced wheat yields by up to 30% in some regions.

Electricity access disparities are also significant:

* **Development Barriers**: Limited electricity leads to reduced economic opportunities, particularly in rural areas where most of the population lives.
* **Health and Education Outcomes**: Inadequate lighting at night makes it difficult for children to study, and lack of power hinders healthcare services. For example, a 2015 report found that sub-Saharan Africa had only [39%] electrification rates compared to an average of 86% worldwide.

Renewable energy consumption is particularly low:

* **Energy Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa imports most of its electricity from neighboring countries, which can be unreliable and costly. For instance, in 2015, Kenya imported nearly half of its power generation capacity.
* **Environmental Impact**: High reliance on fossil fuels contributes to climate change, making it harder for vulnerable regions like Sub-Saharan Africa to adapt.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges effectively:

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**:
	* Invest in water infrastructure projects such as rainwater harvesting systems and pipelines.
	* Promote community-led initiatives like well-building programs where local communities take ownership of water management (UNEP).
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Sources**:
	* Encourage renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to increase access and reduce carbon emissions (IRENA).
	* Implement policies like feed-in tariffs or net metering systems to encourage private sector investment in renewable energy projects.
3. **Implement Climate-Resilient Agricultural Practices**:
	* Promote climate-resilient agricultural practices such as drought-resistant crops and improved irrigation techniques (IFAD).
	* Support community-based disaster risk reduction programs to enhance early warning systems and improve infrastructure resilience.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in water infrastructure projects can range from $10-$50 per capita, which may be offset by long-term savings on healthcare costs. Renewable energy projects require significant upfront capital but offer substantial returns through reduced dependence on imported fuels.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's water security, energy access, and climate resilience challenges require urgent attention from policymakers. By investing in sustainable infrastructure projects, promoting renewable energy sources, and implementing climate-resilient practices, the region can secure a more prosperous future. Immediate action is necessary to bridge current gaps and ensure equitable development for all.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and international organizations must collaborate to implement these recommendations. Early adoption of evidence-based policies will not only improve living standards but also contribute significantly to global climate goals.
