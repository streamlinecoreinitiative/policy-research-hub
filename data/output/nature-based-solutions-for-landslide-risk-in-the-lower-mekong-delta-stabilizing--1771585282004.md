# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Lower Mekong delta: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the severe challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% of the population) [1] and electricity (53.3%), policymakers must act decisively to implement nature-based solutions for landslide risk management in the Lower Mekong delta. This policy brief recommends expanding access to clean energy sources, enhancing water security through sustainable practices, and implementing climate adaptation measures. These actions require targeted investments and innovative financing mechanisms to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the world's poorest regions with limited infrastructure for basic services like safe drinking water and electricity [2]. Despite these challenges, Sub-Saharan Africa hosts a significant population vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods. Ensuring resilient development in this region requires strategic investments in clean energy, water security, and adaptation measures.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], with some countries like South Sudan having less than 10%. This disparity leads to health risks and economic inefficiencies.
- **Clean Energy**: Access to electricity is even more constrained; only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has reliable access [2]. Renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7%, far below global averages, highlighting the urgent need for diversification and expansion in clean energy sources.
- **Climate Adaptation**: The region's climate resilience remains weak due to inadequate early warning systems and limited funding for adaptation projects. This vulnerability increases during extreme weather events.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Clean Energy Access**:
   - Implement microgrids and solar power mini-grids in rural areas, focusing on peri-urban households.
   - Encourage public-private partnerships (PPP) for financing renewable energy projects.
2. **Enhance Water Security**:
   - Invest in water harvesting systems and wastewater treatment facilities to improve access to clean drinking water.
   - Promote community-managed watershed initiatives to enhance local governance over natural resources.
3. **Strengthen Climate Resilience**:
   - Establish early-warning systems for climate-related disasters with robust funding from international development banks.
   - Provide training and support for indigenous councils in co-management of climate-sensitive ecosystems.

## Implementation Considerations

- Financing: Mobilize public-private partnerships, leveraging existing funds like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) [3] and World Bank grants. Innovative financing mechanisms such as blended finance can help bridge the gap between available resources and actual needs.
- Capacity Building: Train local communities in sustainable water management practices and renewable energy technologies to empower them in decision-making processes.
- Monitoring & Evaluation: Establish robust monitoring frameworks to track progress towards SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) [4] and other climate-related goals.

## Conclusion

By focusing on clean energy, water security, and climate adaptation, Sub-Saharan Africa can achieve significant improvements in living standards while building a more resilient future. Policymakers must act decisively now to address these pressing issues and ensure sustainable development for generations to come.
