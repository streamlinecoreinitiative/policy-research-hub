# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Horn of Africa: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, with severe droughts and water scarcity affecting millions. Peri-urban households, relying on traditional cooking methods that consume large amounts of firewood and charcoal, are particularly exposed. This brief explores the transition towards clean cooking in peri-urban households as a critical component of climate resilience.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Horn of Africa

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the region, affecting agriculture, livestock production, and human consumption. The arid climate, combined with increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, has led to severe droughts in recent years. Peri-urban households are vulnerable due to their reliance on traditional cooking methods.

### Key Statistics:

* [Verify] Average annual rainfall in selected regions (e.g., Ethiopia, Somalia)
* Proportion of households relying on traditional cooking methods (no specific data provided)

## Current Cooking Practices and Challenges

Peri-urban households rely heavily on traditional cooking methods that consume large amounts of firewood and charcoal. These practices contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbate water scarcity due to the energy required for charcoal production.

### Key Statistics:

* [Verify] Energy consumption per capita (no specific data provided)
* Emissions from traditional cooking methods (no specific data provided)

## Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices can improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration in peri-urban areas. Integrating micro-hydro systems with agroforestry can enhance irrigation efficiency, reducing water loss and increasing crop yields.

### Key Statistics:

* [Verify] Water retention rates in agroforestry systems (no specific data provided)
* Energy savings from micro-hydro systems (no specific data provided)

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Support research and development** of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems for irrigation efficiency.
2. **Develop policies and incentives** to promote the adoption of clean cooking technologies, such as biogas stoves or solar cookers.
3. **Establish training programs** for peri-urban households on sustainable cooking practices and micro-hydro system maintenance.

## Closing Outlook

The transition towards clean cooking in peri-urban households is critical for protecting livelihoods under climate stress. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance irrigation efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable development in the Horn of Africa. We recommend that policymakers prioritize research and development, policy support, and training programs to accelerate this transition.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1. **Conduct a comprehensive assessment** of peri-urban households' cooking practices and energy consumption.
2. **Develop a national strategy** for promoting clean cooking technologies and integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Establish partnerships** with local governments, NGOs, and private sector organizations to support the transition towards clean cooking.

### Needed Evidence:

1. **NOAA Climate Dataset:** Specific regions in the Horn of Africa (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade)
2. **World Bank Reports:**
	* "Renewable Energy Consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa" focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).
	* "Access to Electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa," providing data on electricity access (% of population)
