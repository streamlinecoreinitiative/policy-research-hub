# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sahel: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Enhancing Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region faces increasing climate-related stressors that threaten food security, livelihoods, and economic stability of communities. The school feeding supply chain is particularly vulnerable to these impacts. This brief proposes an integrated approach combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance the resilience of school feeding supply chains in the Sahel.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture and Food Security**

The Sahel region experiences rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events, severely impacting agriculture. Climate-related stressors such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves reduce crop yields, affect food availability, and increase poverty levels [verify]. The school feeding supply chain is vulnerable to these impacts due to its reliance on local food production.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Sahel region suffer from high water loss percentages due to evaporation and seepage. These inefficiencies exacerbate water scarcity issues and increase energy consumption [verify]. The use of diesel generators for pumping water contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into farming systems, agroforestry can reduce erosion, increase water retention, and promote sustainable land use [verify].

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers an efficient and renewable energy solution for irrigation. Small-scale hydroelectric systems can provide reliable power, reducing reliance on diesel generators and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions [verify].

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. These integrated solutions improve water retention, reduce erosion, and increase crop yields while promoting renewable energy adoption.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of these integrated solutions:

1. Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. International organizations should provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for communities.
3. Further research is needed on the economic impact, community engagement, and scalability of these solutions.

**Actions/Recommendations**

* Integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains to enhance climate resilience.
* Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers and communities on agroforestry-micro-hydro practices.
* Develop policies and incentives to support the adoption of these integrated solutions at scale.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sahel region faces unprecedented climate-related challenges that threaten food security, livelihoods, and economic stability. The proposed integrated approach offers a critical solution to enhance the resilience of school feeding supply chains by addressing water scarcity, improving irrigation efficiency, and promoting renewable energy adoption.
