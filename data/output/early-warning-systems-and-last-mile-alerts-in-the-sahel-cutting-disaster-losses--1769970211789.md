**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Sahel: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To mitigate climate shocks and improve livelihoods, we recommend establishing early warning systems (EWS) and last-mile alerts in the Sahel region. This initiative will enhance environmental resilience by providing timely warnings to vulnerable communities about impending weather events, such as droughts and floods. By investing in EWS and last-mile alert systems, governments and development partners can reduce disaster losses and promote sustainable development.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts (World Bank, 2023). The Sahel region, which spans across several countries including Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, is particularly prone to frequent droughts and floods (UNEP, 2019). These extreme weather events have severe consequences for communities that lack access to basic services such as clean water and electricity. In the Sahel, only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), while renewable energy consumption is limited at [VERIFY] 19.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

## Analysis

The evidence reveals a stark disparity in water security and clean energy access across Sub-Saharan Africa. The region's vulnerability to climate change impacts is further exacerbated by the lack of early warning systems and last-mile alerts. A study on disaster risk reduction found that communities with access to EWS experience reduced losses from natural disasters (UNDRR, 2019). Similarly, a review of renewable energy policies in Sub-Saharan Africa highlighted the need for targeted interventions to promote clean energy adoption (IRENA, 2022).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Early Warning Systems**: Invest in the development and implementation of EWS that provide timely warnings to vulnerable communities about impending weather events.
	* Partner with national meteorological agencies and international organizations to develop a regional early warning system.
	* Ensure community participation in the development and dissemination of early warnings.
2. **Implement Last-Mile Alerts**: Develop and deploy last-mile alert systems that reach remote communities with critical information on weather events.
	* Utilize mobile phone networks, radio broadcasts, and other communication channels to disseminate early warnings.
	* Engage local authorities and community leaders in the implementation and maintenance of last-mile alert systems.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing EWS and last-mile alerts requires a coordinated effort from governments, international organizations, and development partners. Initial investments in infrastructure and technology are essential to ensure long-term sustainability. Community participation is crucial for the success of both demand-side (access) and supply-side (technology) solutions.

## Conclusion

Enhancing environmental resilience through early warning systems and last-mile alerts can significantly mitigate climate shocks and improve livelihoods in the Sahel region. By investing in EWS and last-mile alert systems, governments and development partners can reduce disaster losses and promote sustainable development.

**Note**: The above recommendations are based on available data and best practices from similar contexts. Specific implementation details would need further research and consultation with local stakeholders to ensure effectiveness and appropriateness.
