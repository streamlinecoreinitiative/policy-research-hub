**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is facing unprecedented climate-related challenges, including droughts and floods, which threaten food security and livelihoods. To address this crisis, we recommend establishing climate-resilient school feeding supply chains that integrate water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation measures. This approach will not only enhance the resilience of school feeding programs but also contribute to achieving global development goals.

## Context & Challenge

The Horn of Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change due to its reliance on rain-fed agriculture and limited infrastructure (World Bank Open Data). The region's population growth exacerbates existing resource constraints, making it challenging to ensure access to safe drinking water and electricity. According to World Bank data, only 32.4% of the sub-region’s population has access to safely managed drinking water, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas (World Bank Open Data).

## Analysis

The region faces severe challenges in ensuring sustainable water supplies. For instance, only about [VERIFY] % of the freshwater resources are allocated for domestic use, leaving little room for future growth (World Bank Open Data). Climate change impacts such as droughts and floods have become more frequent, leading to reduced agricultural yields and power outages. Despite global commitments to increase renewable energy consumption, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with just 6.5% [NEEDS SOURCE] of total final energy consumption coming from renewables (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Security**:
	* Invest in water infrastructure projects like rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Promote community-led initiatives for watershed management and sustainable irrigation practices.

2. **Promoting Clean Energy Access**:
	* Increase investment in renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
	* Implement feed-in tariffs and subsidies to encourage private sector participation in renewable projects.

3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods to mitigate their impact on agricultural productivity and electricity generation.
	* Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure such as flood barriers, water storage facilities, and heat-resistant energy grids.

## Implementation Considerations

The implementation of these policies requires significant upfront investment. However, long-term benefits include improved health outcomes, economic growth, and reduced poverty levels. Potential obstacles include limited funding, resistance from stakeholders, and lack of institutional capacity to implement such reforms.

## Conclusion

Addressing the environmental resilience gaps in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing these recommendations, decision-makers can enhance livelihoods, promote economic growth, and contribute towards achieving global development goals.
