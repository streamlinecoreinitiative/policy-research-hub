**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Practical Steps for Decision-Makers**

## Executive Summary

Decision-makers should prioritize investments in water supply and sanitation infrastructure to improve access to safely managed drinking water. This is essential for promoting sustainable development and improving living standards across Sub-Saharan Africa. We recommend increasing investment in water supply and sanitation infrastructure, expanding electrification efforts, particularly in rural areas, and promoting renewable energy sources.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water, electricity, and climate resilience due to its unique socio-economic conditions. The region has the lowest access to safe drinking water [1] and electricity [2], with significant disparities between urban and rural areas. Renewable energy consumption in the region is only 9.2% of total final energy consumption, far below global averages [3]. Addressing these issues is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Access to safely managed drinking water varies significantly across regions, with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind other continents. Investment in infrastructure and technology can improve access to clean water. For example, a study by the World Bank found that increasing investment in water supply and sanitation could reduce diseases related to unsafe water [4]. Currently, 2.2 billion people globally lack safe drinking water [5], with 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacking this basic necessity [1].

### Clean Energy

Electricity access is particularly low in rural areas, affecting economic development and quality of life. Renewable energy sources like solar power can help bridge this gap while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) highlighted that renewable energy could provide electricity to 3.4 billion people who currently lack access [6].

### Climate Adaptation

Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. Building resilience through early warning systems, improved water management practices, and climate-smart agriculture can mitigate these risks.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase investment in water supply and sanitation infrastructure**: Implement water tariffs to recover costs while ensuring affordability for low-income households.
2. **Expand electrification efforts**: Prioritize rural areas through off-grid solar solutions and mini-grids.
3. **Promote renewable energy sources**: Develop supportive policies for renewable energy projects, including feed-in tariffs and tax incentives.

## Implementation Considerations

* Establish clear guidelines for financing water supply and sanitation projects from international donors and domestic budgets.
* Encourage public-private partnerships (PPPs) to finance and operate electricity infrastructure.
* Implement pilot projects to demonstrate the benefits of renewable energy solutions in different settings.

## Conclusion

Addressing the critical challenges facing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires immediate attention from decision-makers. We urge governments, NGOs, and international organizations to prioritize investments in these areas based on the evidence presented here. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of implementation efforts are essential to ensure that these measures achieve their intended outcomes.
