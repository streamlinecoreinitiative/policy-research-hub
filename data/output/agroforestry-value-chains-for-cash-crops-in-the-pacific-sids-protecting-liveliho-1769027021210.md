**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation due to limited resources and infrastructure. To address these pressing issues, we recommend increasing renewable energy consumption and expanding access to clean water. Our goal is to achieve a minimum of 10% renewable energy consumption by 2030 and increase access to safely managed drinking water from 32.4% to at least 50% by the same year.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa has severe water scarcity issues, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). The region's limited electricity access (53.3%) exacerbates water insecurity by reducing household capabilities to treat, transport, and store water safely (World Bank Open Data). Climate change impacts such as droughts and floods further strain already fragile systems.

## Analysis

Evidence shows a significant disparity in clean energy consumption worldwide, with only 19.7% of total final energy coming from renewable sources globally in 2020 (World Bank Open Data). Sub-Saharan Africa lags even further behind, with less than 5% of its energy mix derived from renewables. Climate projections predict increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, putting water infrastructure at risk.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Renewable Energy Consumption:** Implement policies that mandate or incentivize the use of renewable energy sources (solar, wind) for electricity generation in Sub-Saharan Africa.
	* Target: Achieve a minimum of 10% renewable energy consumption by 2030.
	* Data: World Bank projection indicates 9.2% global freshwater withdrawal could be met with renewables; this suggests potential for higher targets.
2. **Expand Access to Clean Water:** Invest in infrastructure projects like boreholes, hand pumps, and water filtration systems.
	* Target: Increase access to safely managed drinking water from 32.4% to at least 50% by 2030.
	* Data: World Bank data shows only 73.7% of the world has access to safe drinking water; Sub-Saharan Africa's rate is far below this.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investment costs for renewable energy systems and clean water infrastructure are substantial but can be offset by long-term savings on energy bills and improved health outcomes. Political resistance, lack of funding, and technical expertise remain significant barriers to implementation. Collaboration with international partners and NGOs can help overcome these hurdles.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for sustainable development. By focusing on renewable energy consumption and expanding access to clean water, we can empower communities and contribute to global environmental goals. We urge policymakers and stakeholders to prioritize these interventions and work towards achieving the recommended targets.

## Additional Evidence Needed

Detailed breakdown of renewable energy projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, case studies or success stories from regions where these interventions have been implemented successfully, and data on the socio-economic impacts of increased clean water access and renewable energy use.

By focusing on these specific areas, we can make significant strides towards improving environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa.
