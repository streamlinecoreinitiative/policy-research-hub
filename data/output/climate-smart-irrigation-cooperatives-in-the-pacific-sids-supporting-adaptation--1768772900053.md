# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in Pacific SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant challenges in ensuring water security and climate adaptation due to their vulnerability to climate change impacts. This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation, which can enhance resilience to water scarcity, economic instability, and climate variability.

**Climate-Resilient Irrigation Systems: A Key Component of Sustainable Development**

### **Introduction to Water Scarcity in Pacific SIDS**

Pacific SIDS face severe water scarcity due to historical droughts and current challenges such as limited access to reliable irrigation systems. Farmers and communities rely heavily on traditional methods like surface water and rain-fed systems, which are often inefficient and unsustainable.

### **Current Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in Pacific SIDS have several limitations:

* High dependency on traditional methods (e.g., surface water, rain-fed)
* Limited efficiency and sustainability
* Economic pressures exacerbate existing challenges

Farmers' reliance on traditional methods has led to economic instability due to reduced crop yields.

### **Agroforestry’s Role in Addressing Water Scarcity**

Integrating agroforestry practices can improve water retention and recharge through increased vegetation cover, enhancing ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, and carbon sequestration. Case studies from other regions demonstrate the success of similar projects:

* Improved agricultural productivity due to improved soil health and water management
* Reduced vulnerability to climate variability

### **Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems can reduce water usage compared to traditional methods [verify] and save costs through reduced energy consumption. Benefits include:

* Reduced dependency on imported diesel or other fuels
* Improved reliability of irrigation systems

**Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can work together to enhance resilience by reducing environmental degradation through integrated management practices and increasing water security by diversifying water sources.

**Policy Recommendations**

To implement climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives, key policies are needed:

* Public-private partnerships to support project development
* Collaborative efforts with local communities and organizations

Steps towards policy adoption and implementation strategies include:

* Stakeholder involvement in the decision-making process

**Future Research Directions**

Areas of research that can further support this initiative include:

* Economic feasibility studies of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems [verify]
* Lessons learned from successful projects and replication efforts

Potential for replication and scaling up to other regions includes:

* Case studies from similar contexts
* Collaboration with local communities and organizations

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** that supports the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in irrigation cooperatives.
2. **Establish public-private partnerships** to support project development and implementation.
3. **Foster collaboration** between local communities, organizations, and government agencies to ensure effective decision-making and implementation.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives have the potential to address water scarcity, economic instability, and climate variability in Pacific SIDS. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, communities can enhance resilience and support their NDCs under the Paris Agreement. Further research and policy development are necessary to ensure successful implementation and scaling up of this approach.

Changes made:

* Removed speculative claims that were not evidence-backed.
* Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
* Preserved the title and structure.
* Tightened language for clarity and concision.
* Removed fabricated numbers (e.g., "50% reduction in water usage").
* Kept a formal, neutral tone throughout.
