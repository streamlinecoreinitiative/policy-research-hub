# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Great Lakes region: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring water security, providing access to clean energy, and enhancing climate resilience. To address these critical issues, we recommend investing in infrastructure such as wells, pipelines, and storage facilities to improve access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024). Additionally, we propose developing community-based renewable energy cooperatives that empower local communities and enhance energy independence (World Bank, 2020). Furthermore, we suggest implementing policies to subsidize the cost of clean cooking solutions like biogas stoves. By adopting these policy measures, we can significantly improve the well-being and resilience of Sub-Saharan African communities.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change due to its high population density in arid and semi-arid areas (World Bank, 2021). The region struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water ([VERIFY] 32.4% have access to safely managed drinking water) [Source: World Bank Open Data], leading to health issues, food insecurity, and economic stagnation. Moreover, Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is only 19.7% of total final energy consumption (World Bank, 2020), highlighting the urgent need for more sustainable energy solutions.

## Analysis

The current situation in Sub-Saharan Africa underscores the critical need for addressing water scarcity, ensuring access to clean energy, and enhancing climate adaptation measures. According to recent data from the World Bank (2024), only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, while just [VERIFY] 53.3% have electricity access. These figures are far below global averages but significantly above Sub-Saharan Africa's average. The reliance on non-renewable energy sources in the region is another significant concern. For instance, the renewable energy consumption percentage stands at only 19.7%, indicating a substantial gap from international targets.

## Policy Recommendations

To address water scarcity, electricity access gaps, and renewable energy consumption challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend the following specific, actionable steps:

1. **Enhanced Water Security:**
	* Increase investment in infrastructure such as wells, pipelines, and storage facilities to improve access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024).
	* Implement community-based water management programs to promote sustainable water use practices.
	* Encourage small-scale irrigation projects to support agricultural productivity and reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources.

2. **Promoting Clean Energy:**
	* Invest in renewable energy infrastructure, particularly solar-powered wells and microgrids for rural clinics (World Bank, 2020).
	* Develop community-based renewable energy cooperatives that empower local communities and enhance energy independence.
	* Implement policies to subsidize the cost of clean cooking solutions like biogas stoves.

3. **Climate Adaptation:**
	* Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure such as flood-resistant transport corridors (World Bank, 2021).
	* Develop early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.
	* Support community-based disaster preparedness initiatives to enhance resilience against climate-induced shocks.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require a multi-faceted approach involving various stakeholders including government agencies, NGOs, development partners, and communities. Key considerations include:

- **Funding:** Allocate dedicated funds from national budgets and international aid for water security, clean energy initiatives, and climate adaptation projects.
- **Capacity Building:** Train local officials, community leaders, and technical experts in sustainable water management, renewable energy deployment, and climate resilience strategies.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa urgently needs comprehensive interventions to enhance water security, provide access to clean energy, and bolster climate adaptation. By adopting the recommended policy measures and considering practical implementation steps, we can significantly improve the well-being and resilience of Sub-Saharan African communities. Let us take decisive action now to create a more sustainable future for this region.
