# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Andean highlands: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring water security, promoting clean energy access, and building climate resilience. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1] and a mere 53.3% accessing electricity (World Bank, 2023) [2], there is an urgent need for innovative solutions that not only address immediate needs but also lay the groundwork for sustainable development. This policy brief recommends implementing targeted interventions in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to improve resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is acutely vulnerable due to its limited resources and exposure to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods. Poor infrastructure exacerbates these issues, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1]. Similarly, just 53.3% have access to electricity (World Bank, 2023) [2], limiting opportunities for economic growth and development.

The region's heavy reliance on traditional energy sources like coal and oil contributes significantly to carbon emissions, making it susceptible to climate-related disruptions. According to the World Bank (2024), only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, while 53.3% lack reliable electricity.

## Analysis

The limited access to safe drinking water and electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa underscores the urgent need for strategic interventions. According to the Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment (GEMS) report, Sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind in meeting SDG 6 targets for safe water access (UN-Water/WHO). The lack of clean drinking water contributes to diarrheal diseases, which affect approximately [VERIFY] % of children under five years old (UN-Water/WHO).

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following policy interventions:

1. **Water Security**: Invest in sustainable water management practices and improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Implement watershed co-management programs with indigenous councils for improved water resource conservation.
	* Promote rainwater harvesting ponds, which can reduce household water needs by up to [VERIFY] % (World Bank, 2023).
2. **Clean Energy**: Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources and support microgrids in rural areas.
	* Establish policy frameworks for decentralized renewable energy systems to ensure equitable distribution.
	* Implement subsidies or grants for households and small businesses adopting solar-powered water pumps.
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure such as early-warning systems, improved drainage systems, and flood-resistant housing.
	* Collaborate with local communities to design and implement early warning systems for droughts and floods.
	* Support the construction of climate-resilient infrastructure like levees and irrigation canals.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure successful implementation, we recommend:

1. **Funding**: Mobilize public and private sector investments through concessional loans, grants, and international aid.
2. **Capacity Building**: Train local communities in sustainable water management practices, renewable energy technologies, and climate-resilient infrastructure development.
3. **Monitoring & Evaluation**: Implement robust monitoring systems to track progress and adjust interventions as needed.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, promoting clean energy access, and building climate resilience is crucial for the long-term success of Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing these recommendations, we can create a more sustainable future that benefits both current and future generations. Let us act now to ensure a resilient and prosperous region.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners should prioritize investing in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation initiatives.
