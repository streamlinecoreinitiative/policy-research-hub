# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and increasing flood risks. This brief highlights the importance of integrated approaches to address these challenges, focusing on secondary cities with limited infrastructure and resources. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

## Water Security in Secondary Cities

### Current Challenges

Secondary cities in the Lower Mekong delta face significant challenges in ensuring reliable access to clean water due to existing irrigation systems' limitations, including boreholes and canals prone to water loss through evaporation and seepage. Climate change exacerbates these issues through erratic rainfall patterns.

### Agroforestry's Role in Water Security

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, reduce erosion, and increase water retention [verify]. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can create climate-resilient irrigation networks that minimize water loss while promoting sustainable agriculture.

## Clean Energy for Climate Adaptation

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a cost-effective solution for generating clean energy in rural areas, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency [verify].

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to create climate-resilient water supply networks. These integrated approaches improve irrigation efficiency and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

## Climate Adaptation in NDCs

### Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we recommend:

* Subsidies for initial investment costs
* Low-interest loans for community-led projects
* Infrastructure development to facilitate access to clean energy

### Future Research Directions

Further research is needed to validate the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Studies should focus on community engagement strategies, economic analysis, and climate data collection.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Support policy makers in NDC implementation**: Provide technical assistance for integrating climate-resilient irrigation solutions into national adaptation plans.
2. **Develop capacity-building programs**: Train local communities and stakeholders on agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems installation and maintenance.
3. **Establish partnerships**: Collaborate with regional organizations, NGOs, and private sector actors to promote the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The Lower Mekong delta's secondary cities face significant climate-related challenges. By adopting integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, these communities can reduce water loss and improve irrigation efficiency. We recommend policy makers prioritize support for community-led projects, infrastructure development, and capacity-building initiatives to ensure the successful implementation of adaptation targets in NDCs.
