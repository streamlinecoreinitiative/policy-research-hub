# Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Mekong Basin: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Mekong basin is highly vulnerable to climate change, with severe water scarcity and erratic rainfall patterns threatening agricultural productivity and food security. This brief highlights the potential of agroforestry value chains for cash crops as a climate-resilient approach to irrigation in the region.

## Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Mekong Basin

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Mekong basin, with rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns affecting agricultural productivity. According to NOAA's climate dataset, the region has experienced a decline in rainfall over the past decade, leading to reduced crop yields and increased food insecurity.

### Key Impacts:

*   Erratic rainfall patterns
*   Increased water scarcity
*   Reduced crop yields
*   Food insecurity

## Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops: A Climate-Resilient Approach

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, farmers can reduce their reliance on diesel generators.

### Benefits:

*   Improved water retention
*   Reduced erosion
*   Increased energy efficiency
*   Economic benefits

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Mekong basin, policymakers can consider the following recommendations:

1.  **Provide technical assistance**: Offer training and capacity-building programs to support farmers in adopting integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Develop policy frameworks**: Establish policies that promote the use of climate-resilient irrigation methods and provide incentives for farmers to adopt these practices.
3.  **Encourage private sector investment**: Support private sector investment in climate-resilient agriculture through initiatives such as green bonds or impact investing.

### Future Research Directions:

*   Economic analysis: Conduct a comprehensive economic analysis of the costs and benefits of agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Mekong basin.
*   Socioeconomic studies: Conduct socioeconomic studies to understand community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Develop policy frameworks**: Establish policies that promote the use of climate-resilient irrigation methods and provide incentives for farmers to adopt these practices.
2.  **Provide technical assistance**: Offer training and capacity-building programs to support farmers in adopting integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Encourage private sector investment**: Support private sector investment in climate-resilient agriculture through initiatives such as green bonds or impact investing.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry value chains for cash crops with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to address water scarcity and climate change impacts on agriculture in the Mekong basin. By supporting policymakers, farmers, and private sector investors in adopting this approach, we can improve food security, reduce poverty, and promote sustainable development in the region.
