# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Mekong basin: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Mekong Basin: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Mekong Basin is one of the most biodiverse regions globally, supporting over 60 million people through fisheries and agriculture. However, climate change poses significant threats to water security, clean energy access, and adaptation efforts in this region. This brief explores the potential of solar cold-chain technologies for fisheries in the Mekong Basin as a means to support countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

**Section 1: Water Security and Climate Change Impacts**

The Mekong Basin is characterized by complex hydrology, with over 100 million people relying on its water resources. Rising temperatures are altering precipitation patterns, leading to increased frequency of droughts and floods. This has significant implications for fisheries, which provide a vital source of income and food security for millions in the region.

* Climate change projections indicate that the Mekong Basin will experience:
	+ 1-2°C temperature increase by 2050
	+ Changes in precipitation patterns, with increased variability and extremes
	+ Sea-level rise affecting coastal communities

**Section 2: Traditional Knowledge and Modern Approaches**

Indigenous communities in the Mekong Basin have developed traditional practices for managing watersheds sustainably. These include:

* Seasonal farming practices that minimize water usage
* Terracing to reduce soil erosion and increase water retention
* Traditional irrigation systems that optimize water distribution

Modern scientific approaches can be integrated with these indigenous practices to enhance climate resilience. Examples include:

* GIS mapping to identify areas of high conservation value
* Hydrological modeling to predict flood and drought events
* Climate change projections to inform adaptation planning

**Section 3: Case Study - Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries**

A successful case study in the Mekong Basin demonstrates the potential of solar cold-chain technologies for fisheries. This project:

* Provided energy-efficient refrigeration units powered by solar panels
* Implemented traditional fishing practices that minimized bycatch and protected biodiversity
* Trained local fishermen on sustainable fishing techniques and climate-resilient water management

**Section 4: Challenges, Opportunities, and Recommendations**

Despite the potential of solar cold-chain technologies for fisheries in the Mekong Basin, several challenges must be addressed:

* Limited access to finance and technology for small-scale fisheries
* Resistance from government officials to adopting new approaches
* Need for comprehensive data on climate change impacts and adaptation funding

Opportunities exist through increased support from international organizations focused on climate change adaptation. Recommendations include:

1. **Enhance collaboration** between local indigenous communities, modern water management experts, and policymakers.
2. **Increase access to finance** for small-scale fisheries through innovative financing mechanisms.
3. **Develop comprehensive data** on climate change impacts and adaptation funding levels.

**Closing Outlook**

The Mekong Basin is at a critical juncture in addressing the challenges posed by climate change. By harnessing indigenous knowledge, integrating modern scientific approaches, and supporting adaptation efforts, countries can enhance their NDCs under the Paris Agreement. The solar cold-chain for fisheries initiative offers a promising example of how to support water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in this region.

**Data Gaps**

* Detailed climate projections for specific Mekong Basin regions over the next few decades
* Socioeconomic data disaggregated by indigenous communities within different Mekong countries
* Evaluation of existing water management projects that have incorporated both traditional and modern practices
