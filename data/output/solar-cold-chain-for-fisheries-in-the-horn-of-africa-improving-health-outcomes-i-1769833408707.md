# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Horn of Africa: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent droughts threatening food security and livelihoods. To address this challenge, we recommend investing in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries, improving health outcomes during heatwaves. This policy brief highlights the critical gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa's clean water access (32.4% globally, 32.4% in SSA) and energy infrastructure (53.3% worldwide, [VERIFY] in SSA), exacerbated by climate change.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change due to its limited access to safe drinking water ([NEEDS SOURCE]) and electricity ([NEEDS SOURCE]). The region faces significant challenges in meeting basic needs as a result of inadequate infrastructure, economic constraints, and environmental degradation exacerbated by climate change.

**Key Statistics:**

* **Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa**: 32.4 [1]
* **Access to electricity (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa**: 53.3 [2]

Climate change further compounds these challenges, leading to more frequent and severe droughts, which threaten food security and livelihoods in the region.

### Analysis

The lack of reliable clean water sources and energy infrastructure is a major barrier to sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. The region's limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%) hinders economic growth and social progress, particularly for vulnerable populations such as women and children who bear the brunt of collecting water.

* **Clean Water Access**: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan African population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], with over 2.2 billion people lacking safe water (UN-Water/WHO). This highlights a significant gap in meeting basic human needs.
* **Energy Accessibility**: Despite the region's high aggregate electricity availability, only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa population has access to it [2]. Rural areas and low-income households are disproportionately affected, further widening socioeconomic disparities.

Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing drought frequency and intensity, leading to water scarcity and reduced agricultural productivity. For instance, climate-induced droughts in East Africa have resulted in significant crop failures, impacting food security (FAO).

### Policy Recommendations

To address the critical gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa's clean water access and energy infrastructure, it is essential to implement evidence-based interventions that align with local contexts and resources.

1. **Expand Renewable Energy Consumption**: Increase renewable energy consumption to at least 25% of total final energy consumption by 2030 (SDG target) through investments in solar power plants, wind farms, and hydroelectric projects.
	* **Implementation Consideration**: The cost-benefit analysis suggests that renewable energy investment can yield significant returns on economic growth, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability. However, initial capital outlays may pose a challenge.
2. **Enhance Water Management Practices**: Implement watershed co-management with indigenous communities to enhance water resource management practices, ensuring sustainable use of natural resources.
	* **Implementation Consideration**: Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and local communities can foster community ownership and long-term sustainability. Training programs for community members in water conservation techniques are essential.
3. *Promote Energy-Efficient Technologies*: Introduce energy-efficient appliances and solar-powered solutions to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, particularly in rural areas where access is limited.
	* **Implementation Consideration**: Encouraging the adoption of these technologies can lead to substantial reductions in carbon emissions while improving energy security and economic resilience.

### Implementation Considerations

To ensure successful implementation of these policy recommendations, several practical steps must be taken:

* **Funding Mobilization**: Secure international funding through grants, concessional loans, and partnerships with development banks to support renewable energy projects.
* **Capacity Building**: Train local professionals in water management techniques and renewable energy technologies to leverage human capital for sustainable development.
* **Community Engagement**: Involve communities directly in decision-making processes to ensure that solutions are aligned with their needs and preferences.

### Conclusion

Addressing the critical gaps in clean water access, reliable electricity, and climate resilience is imperative for fostering sustainable growth and improving quality of life in Sub-Saharan Africa. By prioritizing evidence-based interventions and community engagement, stakeholders can make meaningful progress toward achieving these goals.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must collaborate at the national and local levels to implement these recommendations, ensuring that they are tailored to meet specific needs within each country.
