**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing investments in resilient infrastructure. Specifically, governments should implement policies focusing on improving water security, increasing clean energy access, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

*   **Key Findings**: The region lags behind the world in terms of access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%). Limited renewable energy consumption at 9.2% of total final energy underscores the need for targeted interventions.
*   **Recommendations**: Implement policies focusing on improving water security, increasing clean energy access, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately [VERIFY] people who lack safe drinking water, highlighting the critical need for resilient infrastructure. Despite significant strides in renewable energy consumption (9.2%), there remains substantial room for improvement. The urgency of these challenges is underscored by climate change impacts such as increased droughts and floods, which exacerbate existing vulnerabilities.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This is a stark contrast to the global average of [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data).

*   **Freshwater withdrawal (% of resources)**: The world's freshwater resources are being withdrawn at an alarming rate, with 9.2% coming from renewable energy sources (World Bank Open Data).
*   **Global population lacking safe water**: Approximately [VERIFY] people lack access to safely managed drinking water (UN-Water/WHO).

### Clean Energy Access

While progress is being made, current levels are insufficient given the region's needs and potential. The lack of reliable clean energy undermines efforts towards sustainable development.

*   **Access to electricity (%)**: Only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).
*   **Renewable energy consumption (%)**: Renewable energy consumption stands at [VERIFY] globally, with limited application in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank Open Data).

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts such as increased droughts and floods exacerbate existing vulnerabilities.

*   **SDG 6 progress - safely managed water**: The global coverage of safely managed water is at [VERIFY], leaving a significant gap to be addressed (UN SDG Report 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

### Water Security

1.  **Increase Investment in Water Infrastructure**: Invest in rainwater harvesting systems and improve water distribution networks to ensure equitable access.
2.  **Promote Renewable Energy for Water Management**: Develop solar-powered pumps and desalination plants to enhance water supply resilience.

### Clean Energy Access

3.  **Expand Solar Power Grids**: Introduce solar mini-grids and off-grid solutions in rural areas where centralized grid expansion is not feasible.
4.  **Support Small-Scale Renewable Projects**: Encourage private sector investment through incentives such as feed-in tariffs and tax breaks for renewable energy projects.

### Climate Adaptation

5.  **Enhance Early Warning Systems**: Integrate climate monitoring data into early warning systems to better anticipate water scarcity and droughts, enabling timely interventions.
6.  **Promote Indigenous Knowledge Integration**: Collaborate with indigenous communities on climate adaptation strategies to leverage traditional knowledge for sustainable resource management.

## Implementation Considerations

### Costs

Initial investments in infrastructure and renewable energy projects can be substantial. However, long-term savings from reduced water loss and improved energy efficiency make these initiatives economically viable.

### Barriers

Political resistance and lack of coordination among stakeholders are significant challenges. Establishing clear government policies and fostering inter-sectoral cooperation will facilitate smoother implementation.

## Conclusion

The imperative to enhance resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa demands immediate action towards strengthening water security, increasing clean energy access, and bolstering climate adaptation strategies. By implementing evidence-based recommendations and addressing practical barriers, we can pave the way for a more sustainable future for millions of people living in this region.
