# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sahel: raising resilience finance for communities

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sahel: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need for nature-based solutions to address landslide risk in the Sahel region of Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), and a mere [VERIFY] % share in renewable energy consumption compared to the global average of 19.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2020), urgent action is needed to improve these conditions. We recommend investing in nature-based solutions that integrate with existing infrastructure to enhance water security, increase renewable energy access, and build climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant vulnerabilities due to its limited access to safe drinking water (32.4% vs 73.7% world average) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and a meager [VERIFY] % share in renewable energy consumption compared to the global average of 19.7%. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, making it imperative for policymakers and development practitioners to implement effective interventions.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind globally in access to safely managed drinking water, with only 32.4% of the population having access (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This disparity underscores the critical need for improved infrastructure and sustainable management practices.

### Renewable Energy Access

The region's renewable energy consumption stands at just [VERIFY] %, significantly below global levels (World Bank Open Data, 2020). Developing and deploying renewable energy sources is crucial to reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate impacts.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change poses substantial threats to water resources and energy systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Increased frequency of droughts and floods necessitates robust adaptation strategies to ensure resilience.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Infrastructure Investments**:
	* Invest in the construction and rehabilitation of drinking water supply systems, particularly in rural areas (World Bank Open Data, 2024).
	* Implement water harvesting and purification technologies to improve access to safe drinking water.

2. **Promoting Renewable Energy Technologies**:
	* Establish public-private partnerships to finance renewable energy projects (e.g., solar, wind) in rural communities.
	* Encourage the adoption of decentralized renewable energy systems such as mini-grids for off-grid areas (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

3. **Climate Resilience Programs**:
	* Develop early warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events.
	* Support community-based adaptation initiatives that integrate traditional knowledge with modern technologies (World Bank Open Data, 2024).

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding Constraints**: Governments and international donors will need to prioritize investments given the region's limited financial resources.
- **Technical Barriers**: Ensuring that renewable energy technologies are affordable and accessible requires robust policy frameworks and technical assistance for local communities.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address its water security, renewable energy access, and climate resilience challenges. By implementing targeted policies and fostering collaborative efforts, the region can achieve sustainable development while safeguarding against future environmental shocks. Policymakers should prioritize investments in infrastructure, technological innovation, and community engagement to build a resilient and prosperous future.
