**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Andean Highlands: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to enhance flood-resilient transport corridors in the Andean highlands, where vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by natural disasters. With only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), and a significant portion living in areas prone to flooding, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure is crucial for disaster risk reduction.

We recommend implementing solar-powered wells for improved drinking water access, promoting renewable energy projects to ensure reliable power supply, and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure. These interventions can significantly improve the lives of millions of people affected by flood-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan African countries face significant environmental challenges, including inadequate infrastructure for clean water access (World Bank, 2024) and limited electricity access (53.3%, World Bank, 2023). Climate change exacerbates these vulnerabilities, leading to more frequent droughts and floods affecting both energy access and water security.

## Analysis

The lack of reliable power supply and safe drinking water is a critical issue in Sub-Saharan Africa. Only [VERIFY] % of the region's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), while 2.2 billion people globally lack access to safe water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). The region lags behind other regions in terms of electricity access, with only 53.3% of the population having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Solar-Powered Wells**: Implement solar-powered wells in rural areas where traditional water sources are unreliable or non-existent. This will improve drinking water access and reduce reliance on diesel generators.
2. **Renewable Energy Projects**: Encourage investment in renewable energy projects like solar and wind farms to ensure reliable power supply and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
3. **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Invest in climate-resilient water infrastructure such as flood barriers, drought-resistant crops, and early warning systems.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Cost Analysis**: Estimate initial investment costs for solar-powered wells and renewable energy projects using World Bank data on infrastructure financing.
2. **Barriers to Implementation**: Identify potential challenges such as high upfront costs, lack of technical expertise, and political resistance.

## Conclusion

Investing in flood-resilient transport corridors and climate-resilient infrastructure is crucial for disaster risk reduction in the Andean highlands. We urge governments, NGOs, and international development partners to collaborate on implementing these recommendations to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa.

**Next Steps**: Conduct pilot projects in selected regions to gather data for scale-up efforts.
