# Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in Pacific SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are among the most vulnerable to climate change, with fisheries being a critical sector for their economies and food security. Integrating solar-powered cold-chain technology can enhance resilience in this sector by reducing reliance on diesel generators, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving fish quality.

## Current Challenges and Opportunities

### Water Security and Climate Change Impacts

*   The Mesoamerican Highlands are a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change.
*   Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide sustainable solutions, addressing poverty and promoting renewable energy adoption.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

*   Existing irrigation systems (e.g., boreholes, canals) in the Mesoamerican Highlands are inefficient, resulting in significant water loss.
*   Analysis of water loss percentages from existing irrigation systems is needed to inform more efficient solutions. [Verify]

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

*   Benefits of agroforestry for soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration have been demonstrated through case studies.
*   Agroforestry improves water retention and reduces erosion, making it a valuable component of climate-resilient irrigation systems.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

*   Micro-hydro technology (small-scale hydroelectric systems) offers benefits such as reduced reliance on diesel generators and increased energy efficiency.
*   Pilot projects showcasing the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro can inform policy recommendations and future research directions.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

### Key Data Points Needed

1.  **Average Annual Rainfall in Selected Highland Regions** (e.g., Chiapas, Oaxaca)
2.  **Specific Water Loss Percentages from Existing Irrigation Systems** [Verify]
3.  **Cost Estimates and Financial Viability Analysis for Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Projects**

### Needed Evidence Snippets

1.  **World Bank Report:** "Renewable Energy Consumption in Mexico," focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).
2.  **Mexican Ministry of Agriculture Publication:** "Agroforestry Practices and Their Impact on Water Management" (case studies from the Mesoamerican Highlands).

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a comprehensive assessment of current irrigation practices and challenges in Pacific SIDS.
2.  Develop pilot projects integrating solar cold-chains with agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for fisheries.
3.  Establish partnerships between governments, private sector companies, and local communities to support the adoption and scaling up of these integrated solutions.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of solar cold-chains with agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for enhancing resilience in Pacific SIDS fisheries. By supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs, this approach can contribute to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption.
