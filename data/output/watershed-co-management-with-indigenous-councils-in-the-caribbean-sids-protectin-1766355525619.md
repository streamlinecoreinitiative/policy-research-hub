# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Caribbean SIDS: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Caribbean SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant threats to the livelihoods of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean, particularly in terms of water security and clean energy. This brief argues that watershed co-management with indigenous councils can provide a critical solution to these challenges.

**Section 1: Climate Change Impacts on Water Security in the Caribbean SIDS**

Climate change is projected to increase precipitation variability and intensity in the Caribbean region (IPCC, 2019). The average annual rainfall in many SIDS ranges from [verify] mm. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, resulting in water loss percentages of up to 35% due to evaporation and seepage.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods in the Caribbean SIDS rely on diesel generators that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day (World Bank, 2018), while canal systems lose significant amounts of water through evaporation and seepage.

**Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it more resilient to climate change impacts (FAO, 2018). Benefits of agroforestry include:

* Soil organic matter increases by [verify]%
* Biodiversity increase by [verify] native species
* Carbon sequestration benefits are reported in various studies

Case studies from similar regions demonstrate successful implementation of agroforestry systems.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Key data points include:

* Power generation ranges from [verify] kW per system
* Energy efficiency is reported to be at [verify]%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. Key data points include:

* Total project cost per hectare is [verify]
* Return on investment (ROI) is reported to be [verify] years
* Long-term sustainability assessments are needed

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Policy Support**: Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt sustainable irrigation solutions.
2. **Capacity Building**: Training programs should be established to build capacity among indigenous councils and local communities.
3. **Infrastructure Development**: Investments in infrastructure, such as roads and storage facilities, are necessary to support integrated watershed co-management.

**Closing Outlook**

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils offers a promising solution to climate stress in the Caribbean SIDS. Further research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability of these solutions.
