# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Andean Highlands**

**Executive Summary:**
This project proposal aims to address severe water scarcity in the Andean Highlands through the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems. The proposed solution combines the benefits of agroforestry, including improved soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, with the efficiency of micro-hydro technology.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Andean Highlands**

The Andean Highlands are characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and severe water scarcity, posing significant challenges to agriculture and food security. Climate change has exacerbated these issues, leading to increased frequency and severity of droughts and heatwaves.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Andean Highlands often rely on boreholes or canals, which are prone to water loss through evaporation and seepage. These inefficiencies not only waste precious resources but also contribute to soil degradation and decreased crop yields.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve water retention, reduce erosion, and increase biodiversity. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can enhance soil health, promote carbon sequestration, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for improving irrigation efficiency in the Andean Highlands. These small-scale hydroelectric systems can reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase crop yields by harnessing the power of local water sources.

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems. By combining these approaches, farmers can improve water retention, reduce erosion, and increase crop yields while also reducing energy costs.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Subsidies:** Provide financial incentives for farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Low-Interest Loans:** Offer low-interest loans or grants to support the development of micro-hydro infrastructure.
3.  **Infrastructure Development:** Invest in the construction of micro-hydro systems and associated infrastructure.

**Closing Outlook:**
The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for addressing water scarcity in the Andean Highlands. By promoting sustainable land use practices, improving irrigation efficiency, and reducing energy costs, this approach can contribute to climate resilience and improved food security in the region.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Conduct long-term sustainability assessments:** Evaluate the environmental and social impacts of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems over extended periods.
2.  **Develop community engagement strategies:** Foster collaboration between farmers, local communities, and government agencies to promote adoption and ensure sustainable management of these systems.
3.  **Invest in infrastructure development:** Support the construction of micro-hydro systems and associated infrastructure.
