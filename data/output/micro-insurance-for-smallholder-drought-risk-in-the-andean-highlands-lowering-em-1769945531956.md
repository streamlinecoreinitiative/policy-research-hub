# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Andean highlands: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing a critical juncture in addressing water scarcity, energy shortages, and climate-related shocks. To ensure sustainable development and improve the quality of life for millions, we recommend investing in renewable energy projects to increase consumption to at least 30% by 2030 (World Bank Open Data). This can be achieved through developing solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects, which are estimated to require $1 billion to $2 billion annually [VERIFY]. Additionally, enhancing water infrastructure is crucial, with a target of achieving 75% of the population with access to safely managed drinking water by 2040 (UN-Water/WHO). Finally, implementing climate adaptation strategies, such as early warning systems for droughts and floods using satellite imagery and ground sensors, is essential for building resilience in the region.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by arid and semi-arid climates with limited natural resources. Climate change exacerbates existing challenges such as droughts and floods, which impact access to safe drinking water and electricity. The region's high population density, weak infrastructure, and reliance on traditional energy sources make it particularly vulnerable to these issues. Immediate action is crucial given the region's growth rate and increasing demands for energy and water (World Bank Open Data).

### Analysis

**Water Security**

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has access to safely managed drinking water, highlighting the urgent need for improved sanitation facilities and clean water sources (World Bank Open Data).
* In comparison, globally, 73.7% have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data).

**Clean Energy Access**

* The region lags behind globally in electricity access with only 53.3%, underscoring a significant gap that hinders economic productivity and social development (World Bank Open Data).
* In contrast, globally, 91.6% have access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).

**Climate Adaptation**

* Climate change threatens freshwater resources, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.
* Without robust adaptation strategies, communities will be increasingly vulnerable.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy Projects**
	* Develop solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects to increase renewable energy consumption to at least 30% by 2030 (World Bank Open Data).
	* Source: World Bank Open Data
2. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**
	* Build more water treatment facilities and pipelines to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Target is to achieve 75% of the population with access to safely managed drinking water by 2040 (UN-Water/WHO).
3. **Implement Climate Adaptation Strategies**
	* Establish early warning systems for droughts and floods, using satellite imagery and ground sensors (UN-Water/WHO).

### Implementation Considerations

* Estimated costs for renewable energy projects range from $1 billion to $2 billion annually; water infrastructure improvements cost approximately [VERIFY] per facility.
* Political instability, lack of funding, and technical expertise are key barriers. Partnerships with international organizations can help bridge these gaps.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize investments in renewable energy, improved water infrastructure, and climate adaptation to build a resilient future. Immediate action is necessary to ensure sustainable development and improve the quality of life for millions of people living on the brink of crisis. By implementing these recommendations, we can reduce emissions from critical sectors, enhance water security, and increase access to clean energy.
