# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including rising sea levels and increased salinity intrusion. Traditional desalination methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for already vulnerable communities. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with wind-powered desalination systems to provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use.

**Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions globally, supporting a significant portion of India's population. Climate change impacts are projected to increase sea levels, threatening agricultural productivity and water security (NOAA climate dataset). Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns will further exacerbate these challenges.

**Current Desalination Practices and Challenges**

Traditional desalination methods, such as reverse osmosis and solar distillation, are energy-intensive and costly. Diesel generators often power these systems, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution (World Bank reports on renewable energy adoption in Southeast Asia). Maintenance requirements and environmental impact also pose significant challenges for communities.

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry systems can enhance water retention and reduce erosion (UNEP publications on agroforestry and climate resilience). Integrating agroforestry with wind-powered desalination systems could provide a sustainable solution for coastal communities.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Wind-Powered Desalination in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential of combining agroforestry and wind-powered desalination. These integrated systems can reduce reliance on diesel generators, increase energy efficiency, and provide a cost-effective solution for water supply (World Bank reports on renewable energy adoption in Southeast Asia). Economic analysis shows that these systems can be scaled up to support adaptation targets.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the widespread adoption of agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems:

1.  **Develop policy frameworks**: Encourage governments to develop policies supporting the integration of agroforestry and wind-powered desalination.
2.  **Invest in research and development**: Provide funding for further research on economic impact, community engagement, and scalability.
3.  **Promote knowledge sharing**: Facilitate knowledge exchange between researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to accelerate adoption.

**Closing Outlook**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally. Integrating agroforestry with wind-powered desalination systems offers a promising solution for enhancing water security and renewable energy use. By supporting adaptation targets in NDCs and promoting policy frameworks, governments can help communities build resilience to climate change impacts.

**Data Gaps**

*   Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected coastal regions
*   Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional desalination methods with agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems
*   Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions
