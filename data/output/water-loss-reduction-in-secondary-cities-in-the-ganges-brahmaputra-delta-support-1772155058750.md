# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, with critical gaps remaining despite global progress. To address these issues, we recommend investing in infrastructure projects like microgrids for remote areas, ensuring access to electricity and renewable energy (World Bank Open Data). Additionally, promoting water conservation efforts such as rainwater harvesting and desalination plants where feasible can help bridge the gap between current status and SDG 6 targets. Accelerated action on these critical issues is necessary to improve the quality of life in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa has only [VERIFY] 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data). The region's population has limited access to electricity, with only [VERIFY] 53.3% having access, and renewable energy consumption is at just 19.7% globally (World Bank Open Data). Climate change impacts are severe, affecting agricultural productivity and increasing vulnerability.

## Analysis

Limited water resources exacerbate health issues; unsafe drinking water leads to diseases such as cholera and dysentery, with an estimated [VERIFY] 2.2 billion people lacking safe water globally (UN-Water/WHO). Electricity access disparities are widespread: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world average at [VERIFY] 53.3%, with only renewable energy consumption reaching about one-tenth of the global total (19.7%) (World Bank Open Data). Climate adaptation requires immediate action to protect livelihoods and ecosystems; projections show significant increases in extreme weather events.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

* Investing in infrastructure projects like microgrids for remote areas to ensure access to electricity and renewable energy (World Bank Open Data).
* Promoting water conservation efforts such as rainwater harvesting and desalination plants where feasible.
* Implementing early-warning systems for climate-related disasters to mitigate risks and reduce loss of life and property.

## Implementation Considerations

Cost-effective solutions should be prioritized; microgrids can provide clean energy at a fraction of the cost of traditional grid extensions. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities is essential for successful implementation. Local communities must be actively involved in decision-making processes to ensure sustainable long-term benefits.

## Conclusion

Accelerated action on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation can significantly improve the quality of life in Sub-Saharan Africa. Stakeholders should collaborate to develop and implement effective policies that address these critical issues promptly.
