**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Great Lakes Region: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

To strengthen resilience against future challenges, we recommend investing in climate-resilient school feeding supply chains that prioritize water security and clean energy access in the Great Lakes region. This initiative will ensure sustainable access to safely managed drinking water for a significant portion of Sub-Saharan Africans, who currently lack this basic need.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a triple threat of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1] and less than half of Sub-Saharan African countries meeting their electricity needs [2], addressing these issues is imperative for sustainable development. Climate change exacerbates existing challenges by increasing drought frequency and intensity, threatening agricultural productivity and community resilience.

Water scarcity affects over 60% of the global population lacking safe water [3], leading to malnutrition, health issues, and economic losses. Energy poverty exacerbates these challenges by limiting opportunities for economic growth and social development. The region's reliance on fossil fuels contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, with renewable energy consumption at only 19.7% [4].

## Analysis

The region's vulnerability to climate change impacts is due to its reliance on rain-fed agriculture, limited access to clean energy, and inadequate infrastructure for water management [1]. Despite these challenges, there is evidence of progress in some areas. For instance, Sub-Saharan Africa has made strides towards SDG 6 targets for water access with 74% global coverage [5], indicating that concerted efforts can lead to significant improvements.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Security Initiatives**: Invest in rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants, particularly in arid regions like the Horn of Africa. Increase funding for community-led water projects to ensure sustainable access [1].
2. **Promoting Renewable Energy Access**: Prioritize solar-powered microgrids and off-grid renewable energy solutions for rural areas. Develop policies that incentivize private sector investment in clean energy infrastructure [6].
3. **Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development**: Implement climate-resilient water management practices such as flood control structures and early warning systems to protect communities from severe weather events [1].

## Implementation Considerations

- Costs: Initial investments in infrastructure and technology can be substantial but are offset by long-term savings on healthcare costs due to improved sanitation and reduced energy consumption.
- Barriers: Political will is crucial for implementing these policies. Engage local leaders and community representatives in planning processes to ensure buy-in and sustainability.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to build a resilient future. By adopting evidence-based interventions supported by strong policy frameworks, the region can mitigate its vulnerabilities and accelerate progress towards sustainable development goals. We urge policymakers to invest in climate-resilient school feeding supply chains that safeguard freshwater ecosystems, ensuring a brighter future for generations to come.
