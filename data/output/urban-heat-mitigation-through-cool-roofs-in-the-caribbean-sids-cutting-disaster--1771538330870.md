**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Caribbean SIDS: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends implementing cool roof technologies in Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to mitigate urban heat island effects, reduce disaster losses, and protect vulnerable populations. With temperatures projected to rise by 1-2°C by 2050 [IPCC, 2020], the urgent need for climate-resilient infrastructure is evident. Cool roofs can reduce surface temperature by up to 3.6°C [Akbari et al., 2009] and decrease energy consumption by 10-20% [Santamouris et al., 2015]. By investing in cool roof technologies, Caribbean SIDS can significantly reduce disaster losses and protect their most vulnerable populations.

## Context & Challenge

Caribbean SIDS face significant challenges in addressing climate change impacts. Rising temperatures are exacerbating droughts, floods, and heatwaves, with devastating effects on human health [WHO, 2018] and economic development. In 2020, the Caribbean region experienced a record number of extreme weather events, resulting in over $1 billion in damages [CDEMA, 2020]. With only 34% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [World Bank Open Data, 2024], there is an urgent need for targeted interventions that address these critical issues.

## Analysis

The data underscores the pressing need to bolster environmental resilience in Caribbean SIDS. With temperatures projected to rise by 1-2°C by 2050 [IPCC, 2020], and surface temperature reductions achievable through cool roofs, this policy brief focuses on actionable steps for reducing disaster losses and protecting vulnerable populations.

### Key Statistics

*   **Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Caribbean SIDS (2024)**: 34 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
*   **Renewable energy consumption (%) - Caribbean SIDS (2021)**: 12.6 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
*   **Projected temperature increase by 2050**: 1-2°C [Source: IPCC, 2020]

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges effectively, the following recommendations are suggested:

1.  **Implement Cool Roof Technologies:** Invest in cool roof technologies for public buildings, schools, and hospitals to reduce urban heat island effects and decrease energy consumption.
2.  **Develop Climate-Resilient Infrastructure:** Incorporate climate-resilient design principles into infrastructure projects, including sea walls, flood-resistant transport corridors, and green roofs.
3.  **Enhance Renewable Energy Access:** Invest in solar power systems for off-grid communities, particularly in remote regions where conventional energy infrastructure is inaccessible.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning and coordination. The cost of implementing cool roof technologies can be substantial but is often offset by long-term savings on energy consumption [Santamouris et al., 2015]. Similarly, the initial investment in renewable energy systems may be high but yields significant benefits in terms of reduced carbon emissions and improved public health.

## Conclusion

Enhancing environmental resilience in Caribbean SIDS through cool roof technologies, climate-resilient infrastructure, and renewable energy access is crucial for reducing disaster losses and protecting vulnerable populations. By adopting these recommendations, governments and development partners can significantly improve the quality of life for millions of people living in poverty. Let us take immediate action to ensure a more resilient future for all.
