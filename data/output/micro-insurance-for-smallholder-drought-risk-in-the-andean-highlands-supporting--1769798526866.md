# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Andean highlands: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

Here is the revised policy brief with verified claims, proper sourcing, and tightened language:

**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address drought risk and climate adaptation for smallholder farmers in the Andean highlands. With only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1], and a significant portion of the region's population lacking reliable electricity supply (53.3% coverage), immediate action is required to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience.

**Key Recommendation:** Implement micro-insurance programs for smallholder farmers in drought-prone areas to mitigate crop losses and support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. The region is one of the most vulnerable to climate change impacts, with limited resources for sustainable development. Water scarcity, unreliable electricity supply, and inadequate clean energy options exacerbate existing challenges.

**Why It Matters Now:** Immediate action is needed to improve water security, enhance access to clean energy, and bolster climate resilience, ensuring long-term stability and prosperity. The region's population is projected to reach 2 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2022) [2], increasing the pressure on already strained resources.

## Analysis

### Water Security:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1].
* Freshwater withdrawal accounts for a significant portion of global resources (World Bank Open Data, 2021) [3].

### Clean Energy:

* Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa remains low, accounting for only 7.5% of total final energy consumption compared to the global average of 19.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2020) [4].
* Access to electricity stands at just 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank Open Data, 2023) [5].

### Climate Adaptation:

* The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are increasing, posing severe threats to water resources and infrastructure.
* For example, floods and droughts have led to widespread crop failures and displacement.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Implement Micro-insurance Programs:** Develop and implement micro-insurance programs for smallholder farmers in drought-prone areas to mitigate crop losses and support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.
2. **Invest in Water Infrastructure:** Invest in large-scale water storage projects (e.g., dams and reservoirs) to enhance water supply resilience.
3. **Promote Renewable Energy:** Encourage public-private partnerships to develop solar, wind, and hydro energy projects, prioritizing decentralized renewable energy solutions for remote areas.

## Implementation Considerations

* Establish dedicated funds to support micro-insurance programs and water infrastructure projects.
* Engage local communities in planning and implementation processes.
* Leverage existing development frameworks and foster international cooperation to overcome high upfront costs and limited institutional capacity.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address drought risk, climate adaptation, and sustainable development challenges. By prioritizing evidence-based interventions and collaborative efforts, policymakers can create a more resilient and prosperous region for all inhabitants. Implementing micro-insurance programs for smallholder farmers is a critical step towards supporting adaptation targets in NDCs.
