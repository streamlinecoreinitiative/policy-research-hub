# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: raising resilience finance for communities

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity, compounded by climate variability that exacerbates droughts and floods. To address these pressing issues, we recommend implementing targeted water and energy infrastructure projects, enhancing renewable energy adoption, and integrating climate adaptation measures into development plans.

Key findings:

* Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) compared to the global average of 73.7% [1].
* Access to electricity stands at 53.3%, far below the world's rate of 91.6% [2].

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts due to its reliance on rain-fed agriculture. Water scarcity leads to malnutrition and disease outbreaks, while widespread electricity shortages hinder economic growth.

Meeting these challenges requires immediate attention as they threaten progress towards SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and sustainable development goals [3]. The region's freshwater withdrawal constitutes only 9.2% of total resources available, exacerbated by inefficient management practices and climate variability leading to more frequent droughts [4].

## Analysis

According to the World Bank, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in renewable energy adoption, with less than 50% access to electricity despite being a leader in renewable energy consumption globally (19.7%) [5]. This disparity highlights the need for localized solutions tailored to rural areas.

Renewable energy can provide a reliable source of power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change impacts. However, investment in infrastructure is necessary to support widespread adoption.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in rainwater harvesting and small-scale irrigation systems** to improve water security for communities.
2. **Develop community-managed water points like wells and boreholes**, promoting sustainable management practices.
3. **Encourage private sector investment through grants and subsidies**, leveraging resources for infrastructure development.
4. **Promote the installation of solar-powered microgrids in rural areas**, enhancing access to electricity.
5. **Invest in off-grid renewable energy projects such as hydro mini-grids**, providing reliable power sources.
6. **Implement early warning systems** to mitigate climate impacts on water resources, ensuring communities are prepared for droughts and floods.

## Implementation Considerations

* Engage local communities in planning and decision-making processes to ensure ownership and sustainability.
* Allocate funds through grants and low-interest loans to support infrastructure development.
* Estimates range from $10-$20 million per project based on current technology costs [6]. **[VERIFY]**
* Potential barriers include resistance from traditional power sources, lack of skilled labor, and inadequate regulatory frameworks.

## Conclusion

By focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, Sub-Saharan Africa can build a foundation for sustainable development. Immediate action is necessary to address the immediate needs while laying down resilient infrastructure for future generations. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities will be pivotal in achieving these goals.
