**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Indus Watershed: Stabilizing Food Security During Droughts**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the need to enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains within the Indus watershed, a critical region for food security. We recommend investing in solar-powered desalination plants and implementing feed-in tariffs for small-scale renewable energy projects to ensure access to clean water and electricity during droughts. By adopting these evidence-based solutions, we can stabilize food security and support sustainable development.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing severe water scarcity, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This shortage exacerbates health risks and economic disparities, particularly in rural areas where communities rely heavily on rainwater harvesting systems. Climate change further compounds these challenges by increasing drought frequency and severity.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This stark contrast underscores the need for improved infrastructure and sustainable management practices.
- **Clean Energy Access**: Despite substantial renewable energy potential, only 53.3% of residents have electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa [2]. Significant disparities exist between urban and rural areas, highlighting regional inequalities.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Renewable Energy Use**: Invest in solar-powered desalination plants to provide freshwater in arid regions. Implement feed-in tariffs for small-scale renewable energy projects in remote communities.
2. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**: Develop rainwater harvesting systems and community-based water management initiatives. Promote the use of low-cost, high-efficiency water filters and purification technologies.
3. **Climate-Resilient Energy Solutions**: Adopt microgrids that integrate solar power with battery storage for off-grid areas. Encourage energy-efficient appliances in public buildings to reduce overall electricity demand.

## Implementation Considerations

- Cost Analysis: Initial investments will be substantial but offset by long-term savings from reduced water scarcity and improved health outcomes.
- Stakeholder Engagement: Collaboration between government, NGOs, and local communities is essential for successful implementation of these projects. Public-private partnerships can facilitate resource mobilization.
- Policy Frameworks: Establish clear guidelines on financing mechanisms and regulatory frameworks to ensure sustainability and accountability.

## Conclusion

Improving climate resilience in school feeding supply chains within the Indus watershed requires concerted efforts from policymakers, NGOs, and communities alike. By adopting evidence-based solutions, we can stabilize food security and support sustainable development. We urge governments and stakeholders to prioritize these recommendations and invest in a more resilient future for Sub-Saharan Africa.
