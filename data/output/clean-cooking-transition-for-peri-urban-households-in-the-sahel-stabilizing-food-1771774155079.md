# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Sahel: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sahel: Stabilizing Food Security During Droughts**

### Executive Summary

The transition to clean cooking solutions is critical for peri-urban households in the Sahel, where droughts and food insecurity are increasingly prevalent. With [VERIFY] % of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacking access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), and only 53.3% having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data), promoting clean energy solutions is essential for improving health outcomes and reducing poverty. This policy brief recommends the following:

* Invest in large-scale water harvesting and storage projects in arid regions.
* Promote community-led initiatives like rainwater harvesting ponds and small-scale irrigation systems.
* Encourage off-grid renewable energy solutions such as solar home systems and mini-grids.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally, with significant disparities in access to safe drinking water and electricity. According to recent studies (World Bank), droughts and floods have become more frequent and severe, impacting water availability, agricultural productivity, and energy generation. The region's reliance on fossil fuels for electricity production contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, intensifying climate impacts.

### Analysis

The current state of water security and clean energy in Sub-Saharan Africa highlights significant disparities from global standards. For instance, the percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population with access to safely managed drinking water stands at 32.4% (World Bank Open Data), versus a worldwide average of [VERIFY] % (World Bank Open Data). Similarly, electricity access is significantly lower in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to the world average: only 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).

These disparities are exacerbated by climate vulnerabilities. According to recent studies (World Bank), droughts and floods have become more frequent and severe, impacting water availability, agricultural productivity, and energy generation.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Implement large-scale water harvesting and storage projects in arid regions.
	* Promote community-led initiatives like rainwater harvesting ponds and small-scale irrigation systems.
	* Invest in wastewater treatment facilities and improve sanitation infrastructure to enhance safe drinking water access.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Solutions**:
	* Expand solar energy deployment, particularly through solar-powered wells and micro-grids for remote communities.
	* Encourage off-grid renewable energy solutions such as solar home systems and mini-grids.
	* Invest in public-private partnerships (PPPs) to finance renewable energy projects.
3. **Build Climate Resilience**:
	* Develop early warning systems, focusing on the Andean highlands where climate stress is particularly acute.
	* Implement agroforestry value chains for cash crops to enhance resilience against weather shocks.
	* Strengthen institutional frameworks and governance structures to manage natural resources sustainably.

### Implementation Considerations

* **Costs**: Initial investments in infrastructure projects can range from $10 million to over $50 million, depending on the scale of the project. However, long-term benefits include improved health outcomes, economic growth, and reduced poverty.
* **Barriers**: Political inertia, lack of funding, and technical challenges are common barriers. Addressing these requires strong political commitment, innovative financing mechanisms, and robust implementation plans.

### Conclusion

Addressing water security, promoting clean energy solutions, and building climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is essential for sustainable development. By implementing the recommendations outlined above, we can significantly improve the lives of millions living in poverty and vulnerability. Let us take immediate action to ensure a resilient future for all.
