**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), and 53.3% lacking electricity (World Bank Open Data), millions are vulnerable to extreme weather events and health issues. To bridge these gaps, we recommend prioritizing investments in microgrids for rural clinics, clean cooking transitions for peri-urban households, and solar cold-chains for fisheries.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, with 32.4% of its population lacking access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates this vulnerability by altering precipitation patterns and increasing droughts (IPCC, 2020). The region's energy mix is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, with only [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption coming from renewables (World Bank Open Data).

## Analysis

### Access to Safe Drinking Water

Sub-Saharan Africa lags significantly behind other regions in access to safely managed drinking water, with a coverage rate of 32.4% compared to the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data). This disparity is particularly concerning given the region's high population growth rates and urbanization trends.

### Clean Energy Access

Limited electricity availability impacts daily life and economic opportunities in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 53.3% of the population having access to electricity, millions rely on polluting fuels for cooking and lighting (World Bank Open Data).

### Renewable Energy Consumption

Sub-Saharan Africa has underinvested in renewable energy, with [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption coming from renewables (World Bank Open Data). This is a missed opportunity, given the region's vast solar and wind resources.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Microgrids for Rural Clinics**: Implement pilot projects to provide reliable electricity in remote clinics, ensuring continuous access to medical services and reducing health risks.
	* Estimated cost: $100,000 to $200,000 per microgrid project
	* Actors: Governments, NGOs, private sector companies
	* Timeframe: Immediate implementation with a 2-year evaluation period
2. **Clean Cooking Transitions**: Encourage the adoption of clean cookstoves among peri-urban households, improving indoor air quality and reducing deforestation.
	* Estimated cost: $50 to $100 per household
	* Actors: Governments, NGOs, private sector companies
	* Timeframe: 3-year transition period with a focus on peri-urban areas
3. **Solar Cold-Chains for Fisheries**: Invest in solar-powered cold storage solutions for fish processing units, extending shelf life and ensuring food safety.
	* Estimated cost: $20,000 to $50,000 per unit
	* Actors: Governments, NGOs, private sector companies
	* Timeframe: Immediate implementation with a 2-year evaluation period

## Implementation Considerations

Costs: The estimated costs for microgrid projects range from $100,000 to $200,000 per project. Clean cooking transitions and solar cold-chains have lower costs, ranging from $50 to $100 per household and $20,000 to $50,000 per unit, respectively.

Potential Barriers: Resistance to change among traditional users and insufficient grid infrastructure in remote areas may hinder implementation.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. To bridge these gaps, we recommend prioritizing investments in microgrids for rural clinics, clean cooking transitions for peri-urban households, and solar cold-chains for fisheries. Immediate action is necessary to improve the lives of millions and ensure a more resilient future.
