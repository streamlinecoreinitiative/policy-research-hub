# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Horn of Africa: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity and energy poverty issues, which exacerbate climate vulnerability. To address these interconnected challenges, we recommend investing in renewable energy to increase consumption from 9.2% (World Bank) to at least 30% by 2030, implementing efficient water distribution systems, including rainwater harvesting and desalination plants, and enhancing climate adaptation measures through early warning systems and drought-resistant crops.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's population is rapidly growing while facing severe water scarcity, leading to health issues and economic losses. Climate change intensifies these challenges, necessitating urgent interventions to ensure sustainable development. The region has limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%, [Source: World Bank Open Data]) and electricity (53.3%, [Source: World Bank Open Data]), highlighting critical gaps in basic infrastructure.

### Analysis

#### Water Security

Only 32.4% of the region's population has access to safely managed drinking water, with 87.6% lacking basic sanitation facilities ([NEEDS SOURCE]). This is a significant gap compared to global coverage (73.7%, [Source: World Bank Open Data]), which underscores the need for targeted interventions.

#### Clean Energy

Access to electricity is unevenly distributed; only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to it, limiting economic and social development. Renewable energy consumption worldwide stands at 19.7% ([Source: World Bank Open Data]), highlighting opportunities for growth in the region.

#### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts are severe, with increasing droughts, floods, and extreme weather events threatening water security and energy systems. Enhancing agricultural resilience through drought-resistant crops and soil conservation techniques is critical to ensure food security and reduce vulnerability ([Source: World Bank]).

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Investment**:
	* Increase renewable energy consumption from 9.2% to at least 30% by 2030.
	* Implement policies that promote solar, wind, and hydro power generation.
2. **Water Management Systems**:
	* Develop and implement efficient water distribution systems, including rainwater harvesting and desalination plants.
	* Strengthen institutional frameworks for managing shared water resources.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Invest in early warning systems to predict climate-related disasters.
	* Enhance agricultural resilience through drought-resistant crops and soil conservation techniques.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Estimated $10 billion annually over 5 years for renewable energy projects, with significant upfront investment required. [VERIFY]
- **Barriers**: Political resistance, lack of skilled labor, and limited financing are major obstacles to implementation.

### Conclusion

By focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate resilience, Sub-Saharan Africa can significantly improve the quality of life for its citizens while contributing positively to global sustainability efforts. Immediate action is needed to overcome current challenges and realize long-term benefits.
