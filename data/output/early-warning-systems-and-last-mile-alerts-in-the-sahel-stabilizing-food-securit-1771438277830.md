# early-warning systems and last-mile alerts in the Sahel: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Enhancing Environmental Resilience: Access to Clean Water, Reliable Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions focused on water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With nearly 2.2 billion people lacking safe drinking water [Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022], the region is at high risk of health crises exacerbated by droughts and floods. To address this challenge, we recommend developing community-based early warning systems for droughts and floods; prioritizing investments in renewable energy projects; and implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices to enhance food security.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by a high prevalence of water scarcity, poor sanitation conditions, and limited access to clean energy. Climate change has intensified these challenges through increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events [Source: IPCC AR6]. The region's socio-economic development and environmental sustainability are heavily reliant on improved water security, reliable energy sources, and climate adaptation measures.

According to the World Bank Open Data (2024), only 73.7% of the global population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data], while Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with less than 50% electricity access (% of population) [Source: World Bank, 2024]. This disparity is due to limited investment, unreliable grid infrastructure, and high dependency on fossil fuels for energy generation.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water. Approximately [VERIFY] % of the population lacks basic sanitation facilities [Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022]. Climate change exacerbates this issue by reducing surface water availability and increasing groundwater salinity in coastal areas.

### Clean Energy Access

The region lags behind other continents with only about 46.5% electricity access (% of population) in Sub-Saharan Africa [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. This disparity is due to limited investment, unreliable grid infrastructure, and high dependency on fossil fuels for energy generation.

### Climate Adaptation

While efforts are being made, the region still faces significant barriers in implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices. Limited funding, lack of awareness among farmers, and inadequate extension services hinder progress.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security**:
	* Implement community-based early warning systems for droughts and floods to minimize health risks.
	* Invest in rainwater harvesting projects and desalination facilities to enhance water security.
	* Promote the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices that conserve soil moisture and reduce runoff.
2. **Clean Energy Access**:
	* Encourage public-private partnerships (PPPs) to finance renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind power.
	* Provide subsidies for households switching from traditional fuels like wood or kerosene to cleaner alternatives such as LPG stoves.
	* Develop comprehensive training programs for rural communities on the safe use of alternative cooking technologies.
3. **Climate Adaptation**:
	* Integrate climate-resilient agriculture practices in national agricultural policies and extension services.
	* Establish early warning systems for extreme weather events through collaboration with meteorological agencies.
	* Implement crop diversification strategies to reduce farmers' vulnerability to climate shocks.

## Implementation Considerations

Developing detailed implementation plans, including timelines and milestones, is crucial. Allocate dedicated funding streams from international development partners and national budgets. Estimated costs range from $0.50 to $1 per capita annually [Source: World Bank, 2024] for water security projects, while clean energy access initiatives require an estimated investment of [VERIFY] ($/kWh) [Source: IEA, 2023].

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's environmental resilience in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is critical for sustainable development. By adopting evidence-based interventions such as community-based early warning systems, renewable energy investments, and climate-resilient agricultural practices, the region can significantly improve its socio-economic conditions while mitigating climate change impacts.
