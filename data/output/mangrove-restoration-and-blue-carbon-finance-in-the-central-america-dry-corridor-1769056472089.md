**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Central America Dry Corridor: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

To enhance water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing investments in community-based renewable energy cooperatives, decentralized solar-powered desalination plants, and climate-resilient agriculture practices. These initiatives can improve access to safe drinking water (currently at 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa) and electricity (53.3%), while promoting sustainable development pathways.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, with over [VERIFY] % of the population lacking access to safely managed drinking water. Climate change exacerbates droughts and floods, further straining existing inequalities. Addressing these challenges requires urgent action to ensure sustainable development goals are met (UN SDG Report 2023).

## Analysis

**Water Security:**

* Global coverage for safely managed drinking water is at [VERIFY] % (World Bank Open Data), but Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 32.4% (World Bank Open Data).
* Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of resources globally (World Bank Open Data).

**Clean Energy:**

* Access to electricity in the world is at 91.6% (World Bank Open Data), but Sub-Saharan Africa struggles, with only 53.3% having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).
* Renewable energy consumption stands at [VERIFY] % globally (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase funding for water infrastructure projects** to improve access and quality of drinking water supplies, particularly in rural areas.
2. **Promote decentralized solar-powered desalination plants** to provide safe drinking water in arid regions.
3. **Implement community-based renewable energy cooperatives** to enhance electricity generation from solar and wind sources, focusing on off-grid communities.
4. **Invest in climate-resilient agriculture practices**, using water-efficient irrigation technologies like drip systems or rainwater harvesting.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Initial investments can be significant but offset by long-term health benefits and economic growth opportunities.
* Potential barriers: Resistance from local communities, lack of skilled labor, and initial high costs may hinder implementation. Solutions include engaging stakeholders in planning processes to ensure buy-in and sustainability, and providing training programs for community members.

## Conclusion

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must prioritize policies that promote sustainable development pathways. We urge immediate action to develop comprehensive national plans with dedicated funding streams, monitor progress regularly, and seek international support where needed.
