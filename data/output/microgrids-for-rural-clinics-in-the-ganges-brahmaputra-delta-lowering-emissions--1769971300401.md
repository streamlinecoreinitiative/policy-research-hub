**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. The region faces significant challenges in accessing clean water and electricity, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water compared to 73.7% worldwide [1]. Limited renewable energy consumption (9.2%) exacerbates these issues, leading to health risks, economic disparities, and environmental degradation.

To address these challenges, we recommend implementing comprehensive water security programs, promoting clean energy solutions, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies. Specifically:

* Increase funding for water infrastructure to reduce waterborne diseases by improving access to clean drinking water.
* Invest in renewable energy projects such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation to increase electricity access.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), exacerbated by limited renewable energy consumption (9.2%). These challenges are critical due to their impact on public health, economic development, and ecological sustainability. Addressing these issues is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and building resilient communities.

According to the UN-Water/WHO [2], 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe water, with Sub-Saharan Africa being one of the most affected regions. The global average for safely managed drinking water is 73.7%, while Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at 32.4% [1].

### Analysis

Access to electricity affects nearly half of the sub-Saharan African population (53.3%), leading to economic inefficiencies, reduced productivity, and increased healthcare costs due to lack of medical facilities equipped with modern technology [1]. Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is significantly lower than the global average, at only 9.2%, indicating a substantial untapped potential for sustainable development.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Comprehensive Water Security Programs**:
	* Increase funding and improve infrastructure to reduce waterborne diseases by improving access to clean drinking water.
	* Target rural communities where access is most limited through subsidies or grants.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Solutions**:
	* Invest in renewable energy projects such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation to increase electricity access.
	* Provide incentives for households and businesses to adopt cleaner technologies like solar cookers and LED lighting.

### Implementation Considerations

Comprehensive water security programs could cost approximately [VERIFY] annually. Clean energy initiatives may require additional investments but have long-term benefits. Addressing potential barriers such as resistance from local populations, financial constraints, and technical challenges is crucial through community engagement, public-private partnerships, and capacity-building efforts.

### Conclusion

Ensuring environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa requires urgent action on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. By implementing the recommended policies and addressing potential barriers, decision-makers can significantly improve the lives of millions while laying a foundation for sustainable development.

**Call to Action**: Engage stakeholders at all levels to prioritize these initiatives and ensure their successful implementation within budgetary constraints. Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities is essential to achieve meaningful progress in enhancing environmental resilience across Sub-Saharan Africa.
