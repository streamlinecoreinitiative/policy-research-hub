# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by frequent heatwaves and droughts. Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are essential for improving health outcomes among children in this region. This brief outlines an integrated approach that combines agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with clean energy and climate adaptation strategies to ensure water security and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

**Introduction**

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity, heatwaves, and droughts in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, affecting agricultural productivity and food security. School feeding programs are critical for providing children with nutritious meals, but these programs often rely on unsustainable irrigation systems that contribute to water scarcity. Integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with clean energy and climate adaptation strategies can improve health outcomes among children in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.

**Climate Change Impacts and Current Irrigation Practices**

* **Rationale:** Climate change impacts agriculture, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns.
	+ [Verify] Average annual rainfall of 800-1200 mm
	+ Precipitation variability range from 600-1400 mm (source: NOAA climate dataset)
* **Key Data Points:**
	+ Water loss percentages from traditional irrigation systems (evaporation: 30%, seepage: 5%) (source: [verify])
* **Outline:** Discuss climate change impacts, describe existing irrigation systems (boreholes and canals), and highlight specific water loss percentages.

Traditional irrigation methods in the Sudano-Sahelian belt are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy, while canal systems lose water due to evaporation and seepage. The economic impact assessment reveals that cost per hectare for traditional methods is substantial (source: [verify]).

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

* **Rationale:** Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
	+ Specific benefits of agroforestry:
		- Soil organic matter increases by 2-8% (source: [verify])
		- Biodiversity increase by 15-30 native species (source: case studies from other regions)
		- Carbon sequestration by 3-7 tons/ha/year (source: [verify])
* **Key Data Points:**
	+ Case studies from similar regions (e.g., West Africa, East Africa) (source: [verify])

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

* **Rationale:** Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy.
	+ Specific data:
		- Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system
		- Energy efficiency is at 70-80% (source: [verify])
		- Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods (source: [verify])
* **Key Data Points:**
	+ Benefits of micro-hydro systems (e.g., cost savings, energy efficiency) (source: [verify])

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

* **Rationale:** Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions.
	+ Cost estimates and financial viability analysis:
		- Total project cost per hectare is $10,000-$25,000 (source: [verify])
		- Return on investment (ROI) is 3-5 years (source: [verify])
		- Long-term sustainability assessments
* **Key Data Points:**
	+ Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects (source: [verify])
	+ Cost-effectiveness of integrated solutions (source: [verify])

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

* **Rationale:** Policy measures can create a supportive environment.
	+ Specific policy recommendations:
		- Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
		- Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
		- Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)
* **Key Data Points:**
	+ Future research directions (e.g., economic impact assessments, community acceptance studies, long-term sustainability evaluations) (source: [verify])

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop a comprehensive climate-resilient school feeding program** that integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with clean energy and climate adaptation strategies.
2. **Provide incentives for farmers** to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, such as subsidies or low-interest loans.
3. **Invest in infrastructure development**, including roads and storage facilities, to support the implementation of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are critical for improving health outcomes among children in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. Integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with clean energy and climate adaptation strategies can provide a sustainable solution to water scarcity, promote agricultural productivity, and support food security. By implementing these integrated solutions, we can create a more resilient and sustainable future for communities in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.

**Needed Evidence:**

1. **Climate Data:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Ethiopia (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Economic Analysis:** Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3. **Socioeconomic Studies:** Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
