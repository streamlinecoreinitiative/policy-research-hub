**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing severe water scarcity and drought that affects agricultural production and livelihoods. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in lower-income countries.

**Water Security and Climate Resilience in Lower-Income Countries**

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity in many regions, including the Central America dry corridor. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns affect agricultural production, food security, and livelihoods. In lower-income countries, smallholder farmers often rely on traditional irrigation methods that are inefficient.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Ethiopian Highlands suffer from high water loss through evaporation and seepage. Smallholder farmers often use diesel generators to power their irrigation pumps, contributing to climate stress.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion and water runoff. Case studies from the Ethiopian Highlands demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry systems in improving water retention and reducing erosion.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a renewable source of energy for irrigation pumps. By harnessing small-scale hydroelectric systems, communities can reduce their reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential of combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. These integrated solutions offer a cost-effective approach to enhancing water security and reducing poverty among smallholder farmers.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of these systems, policy recommendations include:

* Providing financial incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro projects
* Developing training programs for community-based technicians to install and maintain micro-hydro systems
* Encouraging public-private partnerships to invest in renewable energy infrastructure

Future research directions should focus on:
* Conducting long-term climate data analysis specifically relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia [verify]
* Developing detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Investigating socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop and implement policies supporting the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro projects**
2. **Invest in training programs for community-based technicians to install and maintain micro-hydro systems**
3. **Encourage public-private partnerships to invest in renewable energy infrastructure**
4. **Conduct long-term climate data analysis specifically relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia**

**Closing Outlook**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, with severe water scarcity and drought affecting agricultural production and livelihoods. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation, communities can enhance water security, reduce poverty, and adapt to climate stress.
