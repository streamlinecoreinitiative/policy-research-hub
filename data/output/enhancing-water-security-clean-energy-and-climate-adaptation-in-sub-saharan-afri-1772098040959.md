# Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy and water infrastructure. Specifically, governments should implement policies supporting solar and wind projects for electricity generation, while also funding desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and boreholes to improve access to safe drinking water. Furthermore, we advocate for the establishment of robust governance structures and coordination among stakeholders to ensure effective implementation.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring water security and accessing clean energy. The region has only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024], compared to a world average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. Similarly, electricity access stands at 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa, lagging behind the global average of 91.6% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. Climate change exacerbates these issues, leading to increased droughts and floods that threaten safe drinking water sources.

## Analysis

The evidence is clear: investment in clean energy and water infrastructure is crucial for achieving sustainable development goals (SDG 6). Renewable energy consumption in the world stands at 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020], while Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at 53.3%. The UN SDG Report indicates that only 74% of the global population has access to safe water, leaving about 2.2 billion people without [Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022]. Climate change impacts are also evident, with droughts and floods threatening safe drinking water sources.

## Policy Recommendations

We propose the following policy recommendations:

1. **Increase investment in renewable energy**: Implement policies supporting solar and wind projects for electricity generation.
	* Target: Increase renewable energy consumption to at least 30% of total energy mix by 2030 [VERIFY].
	* Actors: Governments, private sector companies, and international organizations.
2. **Enhance clean water infrastructure**: Fund desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and boreholes to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Target: Increase access to safely managed drinking water to at least 50% by 2025 [VERIFY].
	* Actors: Governments, NGOs, and community groups.
3. **Strengthen institutional frameworks**: Establish robust governance structures and ensure coordination among stakeholders like government, NGOs, and community groups.
	* Target: Develop and implement effective policies and regulations for climate adaptation and water security by 2024.
	* Actors: Governments, international organizations, and civil society.
4. **Promote climate adaptation strategies**: Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods, and support indigenous communities in their traditional practices.
	* Target: Reduce vulnerability to climate-related disasters by at least 20% by 2025 [VERIFY].
	* Actors: Governments, NGOs, and community groups.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementation will require significant investment, but also presents opportunities for long-term savings from reduced healthcare costs due to improved water access and increased energy efficiency. Potential barriers include resistance to change by local populations and lack of technical expertise; solutions include training programs and community engagement initiatives.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa faces pressing challenges in ensuring water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy and water infrastructure, establishing robust governance structures, and promoting climate adaptation strategies. We urge governments, NGOs, and international organizations to collaborate on targeted policies and investments to bridge the gaps in access to safe drinking water and electricity.
