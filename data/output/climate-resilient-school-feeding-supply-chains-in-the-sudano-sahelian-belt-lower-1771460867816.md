# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issue of climate change in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, we recommend implementing climate-resilient school feeding supply chains. This initiative will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also improve food security and nutrition for millions of students. By investing in renewable energy sources, improving water management practices, and promoting sustainable agriculture, we can create a more resilient future for the region.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent droughts and floods disrupting daily lives. The Sudano-Sahelian belt, which spans across several countries in West Africa, faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water [1] and electricity [2]. Climate change exacerbates these existing challenges, leading to food insecurity and malnutrition among children.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: The current state of water security is alarming in Sub-Saharan Africa, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This disparity disproportionately affects rural areas, where women and children bear the brunt of carrying heavy loads for water.
- **Clean Energy**: Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa is a mere [VERIFY]%, compared to global averages (19.7%) [3]. The region's reliance on fossil fuels contributes significantly to climate change impacts such as air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, undermining efforts toward sustainable development.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change-induced weather extremes have increased the frequency of droughts and floods in Sub-Saharan Africa, impacting agriculture and water resources. These events not only threaten food security but also exacerbate health risks associated with contaminated water sources.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
   - Invest heavily in infrastructure projects such as boreholes and desalination plants to ensure sustainable access to safe drinking water.
   - Implement community-based management systems for water resources, involving local authorities and indigenous communities.
   - Promote rainwater harvesting through subsidies and public-private partnerships.

2. **Promote Renewable Energy**:
   - Increase investment in solar energy projects by providing incentives such as tax rebates or grants for renewable energy installations.
   - Expand the use of mini-grids to provide electricity access to remote rural areas, reducing dependency on grid power.
   - Encourage research and development into climate-resilient technologies that can withstand extreme weather events.

3. **Build Climate Resilience**:
   - Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods using satellite imagery and ground-based monitoring networks.
   - Implement disaster risk reduction strategies such as flood barriers, water storage facilities, and community preparedness programs.
   - Integrate climate adaptation measures into agricultural practices to ensure sustainable food production.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Significant upfront capital investment is required for infrastructure projects. Mobilizing public-private partnerships can help bridge the funding gap.
- **Sustainability**: Ensure long-term sustainability of investments through regular maintenance and upgrading of facilities.
- **Community Engagement**: Engage local communities in decision-making processes to ensure that initiatives are culturally relevant and effectively implemented.

## Conclusion

Strengthening water security, promoting clean energy access, and building climate resilience is essential for the sustainable development of Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing evidence-based policy recommendations and considering practical implementation challenges, we can create a more resilient future for millions of people living in poverty and facing daily struggles related to basic needs.
