# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt faces severe climate-related challenges that threaten food security and economic stability due to water scarcity. This brief proposes an integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro system as a solution to address these issues.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt spans across several countries in West Africa, including Nigeria, Chad, and parts of Mali. Climate change has significantly impacted this region, leading to erratic rainfall patterns that exacerbate water scarcity. Agriculture is a critical sector in these economies, but its productivity is heavily dependent on reliable irrigation systems.

*   **Climate Change Impacts:** Erratic rainfall patterns have become more frequent, making it challenging for farmers to predict and plan their crop cycles.
*   **Importance of Resilient Irrigation Methods:**
    *   Food security is threatened by water scarcity, leading to reduced agricultural productivity and income losses for smallholder farmers.
    *   Economic stability in these countries relies heavily on agriculture, which accounts for a significant share of GDP.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian belt include boreholes and canals. However, these systems suffer from high water loss percentages due to evaporation and seepage:

*   **Water Loss Percentages:** Estimated at [verify] % for evaporation and [verify] % for seepage.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   High energy costs due to reliance on diesel generators.
    *   Limited access to clean water sources, leading to increased competition among users.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been recognized as a sustainable agricultural practice that promotes soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration:

*   **Benefits of Agroforestry:** Improved water retention, reduced erosion, and enhanced crop yields.
*   **Case Studies:** Demonstrations of agroforestry's effectiveness in improving water retention and reducing erosion.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a viable solution to improve irrigation efficiency:

*   **Overview of Micro-Hydro Technology:** Small-scale hydroelectric systems that harness the energy potential of water flow.
*   **Benefits:** Reduced reliance on diesel generators, increased energy efficiency, and lower operational costs.

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have successfully integrated agroforestry with micro-hydro systems:

*   **Pilot Projects:** Showcase the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro to improve water supply resilience.
*   **Economic Analysis:** Highlighting cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Conduct a thorough assessment of existing irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, including water loss percentages and energy consumption.
2.  Develop policy frameworks that support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale.
3.  Establish partnerships with local communities, governments, and international organizations to facilitate project implementation.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed approach offers a sustainable solution to address water scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, this initiative can improve irrigation efficiency, reduce energy costs, and promote climate resilience. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of these solutions and inform policy recommendations for large-scale adoption.
