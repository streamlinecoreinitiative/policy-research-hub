**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Andean Highlands**

### Executive Summary

The Andean highlands face severe water scarcity due to climate change, impacting agriculture and food security. This brief proposes integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to address this challenge.

Agroforestry enhances soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while improving water retention and reducing erosion. Micro-hydro technology reduces reliance on diesel generators and increases energy efficiency. Combining these approaches can provide climate-resilient irrigation, improve economic stability, and support sustainable development.

### Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

#### **Water Security**

*   [Verify] 2 billion people worldwide are affected by water scarcity.
*   Irrigation systems have inefficiencies, with significant water loss through evaporation and seepage.
*   Agroforestry can improve water retention.

#### **Clean Energy**

*   Renewable energy consumption is increasing globally (23.5% of total final energy consumption in 2024).
*   Micro-hydro systems reduce reliance on diesel generators, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.

#### **Climate Adaptation**

*   Climate change impacts agriculture, with erratic rainfall patterns affecting crop yields.
*   Agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide climate-resilient irrigation, supporting food security and economic stability.

### Policy Recommendations for Scaling Up

1.  **Subsidies**: Governments can offer subsidies to farmers adopting agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Low-Interest Loans**: Financial institutions can provide low-interest loans for infrastructure development.
3.  **Infrastructure Development**: Governments can invest in developing micro-hydro infrastructure.

### Closing Outlook

Integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can address water scarcity, promote clean energy, and support climate adaptation in lower-income countries like those in the Andean highlands. By scaling up these solutions, we can improve environmental resilience, enhance food security, and contribute to sustainable development.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Conduct socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  Develop cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3.  Establish partnerships between governments, farmers, and financial institutions to support scaling up these solutions.

**Future Research Directions:**

1.  Long-term sustainability assessments of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  Community engagement strategies for promoting adoption at scale.
3.  Economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
