**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: A Comprehensive Approach for Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa face severe water scarcity and energy poverty, exacerbating climate vulnerability. To address these interconnected challenges, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy and improved water infrastructure. This comprehensive approach will not only improve daily lives but also build resilience against future shocks.

Key findings:

* Access to safe drinking water is woefully inadequate in Sub-Saharan Africa (32.4%), with 53.3% of the population having access to electricity [1].
* Renewable energy investment can boost access in rural areas where grid extension is impractical.
* Community-led water solutions, such as community-managed boreholes and rainwater harvesting systems, ensure sustainable, locally accessible drinking water sources.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with limited access to safe drinking water, affecting health and economic productivity. Only 53.3% of the population has reliable electricity [2], significantly impacting daily life and socioeconomic development. Rising temperatures strain existing resources, highlighting the urgent need for adaptation strategies [3].

Background on Water Security:

* Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind globally in access to safe drinking water (73.7% vs 91.6%), underscoring the region's vulnerability and the need for targeted interventions [4].
* Freshwater withdrawal as a percentage of resources is alarmingly high, at 9.2% worldwide [5].

Energy Access Crisis:

* Electricity coverage is also low, with only 53.3% of the population having reliable electricity, contributing to poverty and inequality [6].
* The global average temperature rise since pre-industrial levels has reached +1.1°C, intensifying weather extremes that impact water availability [7].

## Analysis

Evidence on Water Security:

* Sub-Saharan Africa's access to safe drinking water is significantly lower than the global average (32.4% vs 73.7%) [8].
* The global population lacking safe water stands at 2.2 billion people, highlighting the need for urgent action [9].

Energy Access Data:

* Electricity coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa is only 53.3%, compared to a global average of 91.6% [10].

Climate Impacts:

* Rising temperatures strain existing resources, emphasizing the need for adaptation strategies [11].
* The SDG 6 progress report indicates that 74% of the world's population has access to safely managed water, but Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at 32.4% [12].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Investment**: Increase government spending on solar energy projects to boost access in rural areas where grid extension is impractical.
2. **Community-Led Water Solutions**: Implement community-managed boreholes and rainwater harvesting systems to ensure sustainable, locally accessible drinking water sources.
3. **Climate Resilience Programs**: Develop early warning systems and climate adaptation plans that integrate traditional knowledge with modern technology.

## Implementation Considerations

* Initial investment in renewable energy projects can be offset by savings from reduced kerosene use and increased agricultural productivity [13].
* Collaboration between government, NGOs, and local communities is crucial to overcome technical challenges and ensure long-term sustainability.
* Local participation ensures that solutions are tailored to specific needs and more likely to be sustained.

## Conclusion

By prioritizing investments in renewable energy and improved water infrastructure, lower-income countries can build resilience against climate stressors. Stakeholders must work together to implement these strategies effectively, ensuring sustainable development for future generations.
