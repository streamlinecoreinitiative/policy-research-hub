**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring universal access to clean water and electricity, exacerbating climate vulnerability. To bridge these gaps, we recommend that governments and development partners implement policies for:

1. **Universal Water Access**: Develop and fund large-scale water supply projects to improve access in rural and urban areas.
2. **Renewable Energy Deployment**: Establish a renewable energy development plan targeting 15% of total final energy consumption by 2030.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Integrate climate-resilient infrastructure design into all new and existing energy and water projects.

These recommendations aim to address the region's severe water scarcity and energy poverty, which threaten food security and health outcomes.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the least developed regions globally, with [VERIFY] 47% of its population affected by water scarcity (World Bank, 2024). Only half of the population has reliable access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), limiting economic growth and social services. Climate change intensifies water stress and energy crises in the region, threatening food security and health outcomes.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This disparity is due to inadequate infrastructure, poor governance, and limited financial resources. In contrast, globally, [NEEDS SOURCE] 73.7% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water.

### Electricity Access

Despite significant progress in the region, only half of the population has electricity (World Bank, 2023), limiting economic growth and social services. Rural areas are disproportionately affected by energy poverty.

### Renewable Energy Deployment

Renewable energy consumption is [VERIFY] 9.2% of total final energy in Sub-Saharan Africa, far below global targets (World Bank, 2020). To address this gap, we recommend establishing a renewable energy development plan targeting 15% of total final energy consumption by 2030.

2. **Renewable Energy Deployment**:
	* Establish a renewable energy development plan targeting 15% of total final energy consumption by 2030.

3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Integrate climate-resilient infrastructure design into all new and existing energy and water projects.
	* Source: IPCC Climate Change Special Report (2021), World Bank, Sub-Saharan Africa climate vulnerability data (2024).

## Implementation Considerations

The expected costs of implementing these recommendations are significant. Universal water access projects will require [VERIFY] $5 billion annually, while renewable energy deployment is estimated to be 1% of GDP.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must accelerate efforts to ensure sustainable water security, reliable electricity, and climate resilience. Immediate policy action is needed to bridge these gaps and lay a foundation for long-term development success in the region.
