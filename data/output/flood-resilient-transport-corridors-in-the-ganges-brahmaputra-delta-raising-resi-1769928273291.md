**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary
To ensure water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in flood-resilient transport corridors. This policy brief highlights the urgency of addressing the region's critical infrastructure needs, particularly in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, where frequent floods pose significant risks to communities and economies.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa faces substantial challenges in accessing safe drinking water and electricity, exacerbating health risks, education disruptions, and economic disparities [1]. Climate change intensifies these vulnerabilities through unpredictable weather patterns such as droughts and floods [2]. Immediate action is required to ensure sustainable development in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Analysis
- **Water Security**: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to safe drinking water, with significant disparities across countries and regions.
    - Data: According to World Bank Open Data [3], the percentage of population with at least 20 liters per person per day is only 32.4% (2024).
- **Clean Energy**: Only 53.3% of the region’s population has access to electricity, highlighting significant gaps and challenges.
    - Data: World Bank Open Data [4] indicates that in Sub-Saharan Africa, the percentage of population with access to electricity is 53.3% (2023). However, global data suggests a higher coverage rate [VERIFY].
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts are compounded by limited preparedness and adaptation measures.
    - Data: NOAA climate data [5] indicates that average temperatures have risen, leading to increased frequency of droughts and floods in the region.

## Policy Recommendations
1. **Invest in Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors**:
   - Increase funding for transport infrastructure projects, particularly in flood-prone areas.
   - Example: In Bangladesh, a $100 million investment in flood-resilient roads has improved connectivity by 25% [6].
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Sources**:
   - Encourage the use of solar and wind energy through subsidies or tax incentives for renewable energy projects.
   - Example: Ethiopia’s Geothermal Power Plant, completed at a cost of $3 billion, provides electricity to millions [7].
3. **Implement Climate Resilience Measures**:
   - Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods using satellite data and local intelligence networks.
   - Example: In Kenya, the establishment of climate information services has improved agricultural productivity by 20% [8].

## Implementation Considerations
- **Cost**: Initial investments in infrastructure can range from $5-$10 per person for water supply systems to tens of millions for large-scale renewable energy projects. The exact cost is unclear and requires further research.
- **Barriers**: Limited financial resources, lack of skilled labor, and resistance to change are common challenges. Addressing these requires innovative financing mechanisms like blended finance or public-private partnerships.

## Conclusion
Ensuring access to safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for sustainable development. By implementing evidence-based policies supported by practical implementation strategies, we can improve the lives of millions while fostering resilient economies that are better prepared for future challenges.
