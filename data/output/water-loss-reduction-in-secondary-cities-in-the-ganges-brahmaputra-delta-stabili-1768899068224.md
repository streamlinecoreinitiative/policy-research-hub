# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Lower-Income Countries**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the need to address water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in lower-income countries. To stabilize food security during droughts, we recommend investing in infrastructure projects such as desalination plants and water treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water for vulnerable populations. Additionally, promoting renewable energy technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and biomass cookstoves can increase electricity generation and reduce carbon emissions.

### Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and electricity. According to the World Bank Open Data, only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water [1]. The global shortfall of 2.2 billion people lacking safe water (UN-Water/WHO) exacerbates climate vulnerability and hinders economic growth.

Climate change impacts are more pronounced in these regions, affecting agriculture, health systems, and infrastructure resilience. Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world in terms of access to electricity, with only [VERIFY] % of the population having access (World Bank Open Data). This disparity highlights the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions like renewable energy sources and microgrids.

### Analysis

Water scarcity and inadequate sanitation facilities lead to poor health outcomes, with 2.2 billion people lacking safe water globally (UN-Water/WHO) [2]. Sub-Saharan Africa's electricity access is only 53.3%, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions like renewable energy technologies (World Bank Open Data).

Renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7% worldwide, leaving a significant gap to meet climate targets (World Bank Open Data). The global population lacking safe water and electricity underscores the importance of prioritizing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in infrastructure projects**: Allocate funds for desalination plants and water treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water for vulnerable populations.
2. **Promote renewable energy technologies**: Implement solar panels, wind turbines, and biomass cookstoves to increase electricity generation and reduce carbon emissions.
3. **Implement microgrids**: Develop localized energy solutions in rural areas to enhance reliability and affordability of electricity supply.

### Implementation Considerations

Costs associated with these initiatives are estimated at [VERIFY] million/year (World Bank). Potential barriers include limited financial resources, technical expertise, and community buy-in. Addressing these through partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities can mitigate risks.

Microgrids offer a scalable solution by providing localized energy solutions that do not require extensive grid infrastructure upgrades.

### Conclusion

By prioritizing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, lower-income countries can build more resilient societies capable of withstanding future shocks while advancing sustainable development goals. We urge governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to invest in these initiatives to ensure a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
