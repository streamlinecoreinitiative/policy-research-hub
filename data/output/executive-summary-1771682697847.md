**Climate Resilient Water Security and Renewable Energy: A Pathway for Lower-Income Countries**

### Executive Summary

Lower-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity due to environmental stressors like climate change. To address these critical issues, we recommend integrating climate resilience into water security and renewable energy policies.

**Key Recommendations:**

* Enhance access to safe drinking water by increasing funding for sanitation infrastructure projects, including latrines and handwashing stations.
* Promote clean cooking solutions, such as biogas stoves and solar cookers, in peri-urban areas where access is most limited.
* Invest in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries to support adaptation targets under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
* Implement renewable energy projects, including solar mini-grids and wind turbines, to ensure electricity access.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately affected by climate change, with the region experiencing the most severe impacts. According to World Bank data, only 32.4% of the population in SSA has access to safe drinking water, compared to the world average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data). Similarly, only 53.3% of the population in SSA has access to electricity, significantly below the global average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data).

### Analysis

The interplay between climate change and water security is particularly stark in SSA, where droughts have become more frequent and severe, affecting both the quantity and quality of available water resources.

* **SDG 6 Progress - Access to Safe Drinking Water:** 74% global coverage [Source: UN SDG Report 2023]

Renewable energy consumption in SSA is also lagging behind the world average, with only 19.7% of total final energy consumption coming from renewable sources by 2020 (World Bank Open Data). This disparity underscores a critical need for increased investment and policy support to accelerate clean energy adoption.

### Policy Recommendations

To bridge the gap in water security and renewable energy, a multi-pronged approach is essential:

1. **Enhanced Access to Safe Drinking Water:** Increase funding for sanitation infrastructure projects, including latrines and handwashing stations.
2. **Promote Clean Cooking Solutions:** Implement subsidies and incentives for clean cooking appliances like biogas stoves and solar cookers in peri-urban areas where access is most limited.
3. **Solar-Powered Cold-Chain Systems:** Invest in solar-powered refrigeration units to support the cold chain in fishery sectors, aligning with NDC targets.
4. **Renewable Energy Projects:** Integrate small-scale renewable energy projects such as solar mini-grids and wind turbines into rural electrification plans.

### Implementation Considerations

Estimated investments range from $0.5 million to $10 million for a comprehensive water security project, with similar scales for renewable energy initiatives (World Bank Open Data). High upfront costs, limited technical expertise, and regulatory hurdles pose significant challenges in implementation.

### Conclusion

Addressing climate resilience through integrated water security and renewable energy policies is imperative for lower-income countries. By leveraging available data and evidence, decision-makers can craft effective strategies to enhance access to safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and sustainable energy sources.

**Call to Action:** Develop and implement a comprehensive climate-resilient policy framework that integrates water security and renewable energy initiatives, prioritizing Sub-Saharan Africa where these challenges are most acute. Collaboration among government officials, NGO leaders, and development practitioners is crucial for successful implementation.

### Next Steps

* **Policy Development:** Forge partnerships with international organizations to secure funding and technical support.
* **Capacity Building:** Train local communities and governments in climate-resilient water management and renewable energy technologies.
* **Monitoring & Evaluation:** Establish robust monitoring systems to assess the impact of interventions and ensure continuous improvement.
