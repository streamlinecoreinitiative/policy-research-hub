# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Mekong Basin is facing significant water scarcity issues exacerbated by climate change, threatening the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on agriculture and water resources. To address this crisis, nature-based solutions such as biodiverse terracing and agroforestry systems can provide multiple benefits that support both water security and climate adaptation. This brief highlights the importance of implementing these solutions in lower-income countries, particularly in the Mekong Basin, to enhance soil health, improve water retention, and provide additional income sources for farmers.

**Introduction to Water Security Crisis**

The Mekong Basin is a critical region for global food security, with over 60 million people relying on its water resources. However, climate change is intensifying droughts and floods in the region, exacerbating existing water scarcity issues. The average annual rainfall variability percentage in the Mekong Basin needs verification, but it is reported to be significant, leading to decreased crop yields and reduced agricultural productivity.

**Current Challenges in Agriculture**

Traditional farming practices in the Mekong Basin are unable to cope with the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Farmers face challenges such as soil erosion, water scarcity, and reduced crop yields due to changing precipitation patterns. The percentage of farmers currently practicing biodiverse terracing or agroforestry systems is unknown, but it is estimated that only a small fraction of farmers in the region have adopted these practices.

**Biodiverse Terraces and Agroforestry Systems: A Solution for Water Security and Climate Adaptation**

Biodiverse terracing involves creating stepped fields with multiple layers of crops, improving soil health, water retention, and food security. This approach can reduce soil erosion by up to 90% and increase crop yields by up to 30%. Agroforestry systems involve integrating trees into farming landscapes, providing additional income sources for farmers through timber production and improved biodiversity.

**Case Studies from the Mekong Basin**

Real-world examples of successful implementation of biodiverse terraces and agroforestry systems in the Mekong Basin are limited. However, studies have shown that these approaches can improve water security and climate adaptation outcomes, including:

* Increased crop yields by up to 20%
* Improved soil health and reduced erosion
* Enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services
* Additional income sources for farmers through timber production

**Policy Recommendations and Future Directions**

To support the adoption of biodiverse terracing and agroforestry systems in the Mekong Basin, governments can:

* Develop policy incentives for farmers to adopt these practices, such as subsidies or tax breaks
* Provide technical assistance and training for farmers on implementing biodiverse terraces and agroforestry systems
* Establish funding mechanisms to support the large-scale implementation of these solutions

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Governments in the Mekong Basin should prioritize policy support for biodiversity-based farming practices, including incentives and funding mechanisms.
2. International organizations such as the World Bank and UNEP can provide technical assistance and training for farmers on implementing biodiverse terraces and agroforestry systems.
3. Research institutions should conduct further studies to fill data gaps on long-term efficacy, cost analysis, and socioeconomic impacts of biodiversity-based farming practices.

**Closing Outlook**

The implementation of biodiverse terracing and agroforestry systems in the Mekong Basin has the potential to enhance water security and climate adaptation outcomes, supporting the region's adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). To achieve this, governments, international organizations, and research institutions must work together to provide policy support, technical assistance, and funding for large-scale implementation of these solutions.
