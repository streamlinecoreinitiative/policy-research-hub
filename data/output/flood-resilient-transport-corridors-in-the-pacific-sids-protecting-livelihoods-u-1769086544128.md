**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Pacific SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa. With less than one-third of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (32.4% in 2024) [1] and only about half having access to electricity (53.3%) [2], immediate action is necessary to ensure sustainable development and protect the region's future generations. We recommend prioritizing investments in water infrastructure and renewable energy projects to close these gaps.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, electricity, and renewable energy sources due to its resource-rich yet economically fragile nature. The region is home to nearly half of the world's population lacking safe drinking water (2.2 billion people in 2022) [3] and only about one-fifth having access to electricity [4]. Climate change exacerbates existing challenges, with rising temperatures affecting freshwater resources and increasing energy demand.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Despite significant progress towards universal access to electricity (91.6% worldwide), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind (53.3%) [2]. Limited water infrastructure contributes significantly to this gap. World Bank data shows a need for substantial investment, with only 32.4% currently having access to safely managed drinking water [1].

### Clean Energy

Renewable energy consumption remains low at just over a quarter of total final energy in the region, far below global levels (19.7% worldwide) [5]. This is despite the fact that renewable energy can provide reliable and sustainable power.

### Climate Adaptation

Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events threaten existing water security and clean energy infrastructures. Implementing early warning systems for climate-related disasters is crucial to reducing loss of life and property damage, which are critical factors in building resilience [6].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Investment in Water Infrastructure**:
	* Target: Increase access to safely managed drinking water to at least 60% by 2030.
	* Evidence: World Bank data shows a need for substantial investment, with only 32.4% currently having this level of access [1].
2. **Renewable Energy Projects**:
	* Target: Achieve at least 30% renewable energy consumption by 2030.
	* Evidence: Current levels are well below global averages (19.7%) and less than a quarter in Sub-Saharan Africa [5].
3. **Climate Resilience Initiatives**:
	* Target: Implement early warning systems for climate-related disasters by 2025.
	* Evidence: Studies show that such initiatives can reduce loss of life and property damage, which are critical factors in building resilience [6].

## Implementation Considerations

Addressing the gaps in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation will require significant investment. Estimated costs range from $1 billion to $3 billion annually for water infrastructure upgrades and renewable energy projects. Political instability, corruption, lack of skilled labor, and limited funding are major hurdles that can be mitigated through partnerships with international organizations.

## Conclusion

Addressing the gaps in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation is crucial for building a more resilient Sub-Saharan Africa. Immediate action is needed to ensure sustainable development and protect the region's future generations. We recommend prioritizing investments in water infrastructure and renewable energy projects to close these gaps.
