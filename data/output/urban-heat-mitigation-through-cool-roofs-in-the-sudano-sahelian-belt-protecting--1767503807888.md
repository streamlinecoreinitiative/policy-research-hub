**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

Executive Summary:

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most climate-stressed regions globally, characterized by intense heat and drought. The increasing frequency and severity of heatwaves pose significant threats to human health, agriculture, and economic development. This brief explores the potential of cool roofs as a cost-effective and scalable solution for urban heat mitigation in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.

**Section 1: Introduction to Urban Heat Stress**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt spans across West Africa, covering countries such as Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad. The region experiences extreme temperatures, with average annual temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C (77°F to 95°F). Climate change is projected to exacerbate heat stress, with potential increases in temperature by up to [verify] °C (°F) by 2050.

**Section 2: Cool Roofs as a Mitigation Strategy**

Cool roofs are designed to reflect solar radiation and reduce the urban heat island effect. The key benefits of cool roofs include:

• **Temperature reduction**: Studies have shown that cool roofs can reduce surface temperatures.
• **Energy savings**: By reducing cooling demands, cool roofs can lead to significant energy savings in residential buildings.
• **Improved human health**: Heat stress is a major public health concern, with heat-related illnesses and deaths on the rise. Cool roofs can help mitigate these impacts.

**Section 3: Implementation Challenges and Opportunities**

While cool roofs offer numerous benefits, their implementation poses several challenges:

• **Cost**: The initial cost of installing cool roofs can be high, although long-term energy savings can offset these costs.
• **Scalability**: Large-scale adoption of cool roofs requires policy support, public awareness campaigns, and infrastructure development.
• **Maintenance**: Regular maintenance is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of cool roofs.

To address these challenges, governments, private sector companies, and civil society organizations must work together to:

1.  Develop and implement policies supporting the adoption of cool roofs.
2.  Conduct awareness-raising campaigns to promote the benefits of cool roofs among building owners, occupants, and policymakers.
3.  Establish maintenance programs to ensure the long-term effectiveness of cool roofs.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. By adopting cool roofs as a mitigation strategy, we can reduce urban heat stress, improve human health, and support sustainable development. It is essential that governments, private sector companies, and civil society organizations work together to address the challenges associated with implementing cool roofs at scale.

Recommendations:

*   Develop and implement policies supporting the adoption of cool roofs.
*   Conduct awareness-raising campaigns to promote the benefits of cool roofs among building owners, occupants, and policymakers.
*   Establish maintenance programs to ensure the long-term effectiveness of cool roofs.
