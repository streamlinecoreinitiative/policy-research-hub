**Enhancing Climate Resilience through Agroforestry Value Chains in the Mekong Basin: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Mekong basin is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, affecting over 60 million people. Agroforestry value chains can help mitigate these impacts by integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, improving ecosystem services, and enhancing community resilience. This brief highlights the importance of agroforestry in addressing water security challenges, promoting clean energy, and adapting to climate change. It also underscores the need for evidence-based decision-making, emphasizing the requirement for key data points on the impact of agroforestry value chains.

**Introduction to the Mekong Basin**

The Mekong basin is a vital region for global food security, biodiversity conservation, and economic development. Spanning across six countries (Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam), this transboundary river system supports the livelihoods of millions of people. However, climate change poses significant challenges to the region's water security, including reduced river flows, increased salinity intrusion into coastal aquifers, and altered precipitation patterns.

**Current Challenges in Water Security**

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity issues in the Mekong basin. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are leading to:

• Reduced river flows, affecting irrigation, drinking water supply, and aquatic ecosystems.
• Increased salinity intrusion into coastal aquifers, contaminating freshwater sources and impacting agriculture.
• Altered precipitation patterns, resulting in more frequent droughts and floods.

These challenges underscore the need for innovative solutions that address the root causes of water scarcity and promote climate resilience.

**Agroforestry Value Chains as a Solution**

Agroforestry integrates trees into agricultural landscapes to improve ecosystem services and enhance community resilience. By combining crops with trees, agroforestry:

• Improves soil health through enhanced nutrient cycling and reduced erosion.
• Provides shade for crops, reducing water loss and increasing yields.
• Increases biodiversity by creating habitat for pollinators, predators, and other beneficial species.

Success stories from other countries demonstrate the impact of agroforestry value chains on climate resilience and economic benefits. For instance:

• In Rwanda, agroforestry initiatives have improved soil fertility, increased crop yields, and enhanced community livelihoods.
• In Kenya, agroforestry has reduced deforestation, improved water quality, and promoted biodiversity conservation.

**Evidence Needed**

To support the implementation of agroforestry value chains in the Mekong basin, key data points are required. These include:

• Projected reduction in water scarcity (X%).
• Increase in crop yields (Y%) through better nutrient management and pest control.
• Cost savings or benefits achieved per hectare from implementing agroforestry value chains compared to conventional agriculture methods over Z years.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop a comprehensive database**: Establish a centralized platform for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data on the impact of agroforestry value chains in the Mekong basin.
2. **Conduct comparative economic analysis**: Compare the cost-effectiveness of agroforestry value chains with traditional farming practices over multiple years.
3. **Support policy development**: Collaborate with governments to develop policies that promote and support the adoption of agroforestry value chains.

**Closing Outlook**

The Mekong basin is at a critical juncture, requiring innovative solutions to address climate change impacts. Agroforestry value chains offer a promising approach to enhancing climate resilience, promoting clean energy, and adapting to climate change. By filling data gaps and supporting evidence-based decision-making, we can ensure that agroforestry value chains become a cornerstone of the region's adaptation efforts.
