# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

Executive Summary
-----------------

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures. This brief proposes integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to water scarcity in the region.

Main Sections
-------------

### **Introduction to Water Scarcity**

Climate change impacts agriculture in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems experience losses of 30% due to evaporation and 5% through seepage.

### **Current Irrigation Practices**

Traditional methods are not only energy-intensive but also costly. The high energy consumption is attributed to the use of diesel-powered pumps, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Canal systems suffer from significant water losses, further exacerbating water scarcity in the region.

### **Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Key benefits include:

*   Soil organic matter increases by [verify]%
*   Biodiversity increase: By [verify] native species
*   Carbon sequestration: By [verify] tons/ha/year

### **Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation. Key data points include:

*   Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system
*   Energy efficiency: At 70-80%
*   Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions for climate-resilient water supply. Key data points include:

*   Total project cost per hectare is $[verify]-$[verify],000
*   Return on Investment (ROI): 3-5 years
*   Long-term sustainability assessments

Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions
------------------------------------------------------

### **Rationale**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Specific policy recommendations include:

*   Subsidies for farmers: Incentives provided to encourage adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
*   Grid integration: Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
*   Infrastructure development: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements

### **Needed Evidence**

1.  Climate Data:
    *   Needed Evidence: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Ethiopia (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade)
2.  Economic Analysis:
    *   Needed Evidence: Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects
3.  Socioeconomic Studies:
    *   Needed Evidence: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems

Actions/Recommendations List
-----------------------------

1.  Conduct a comprehensive climate risk assessment to identify areas of high vulnerability.
2.  Develop a detailed project plan, including cost estimates and financial viability analysis.
3.  Engage with local communities and indigenous councils to ensure their participation and acceptance of the proposed solution.

Closing Outlook
---------------

The proposed solution integrates agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to address severe water scarcity in the region. By improving health outcomes during heatwaves, this initiative aims to contribute to sustainable agricultural development and climate resilience in the region.
