**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1] and less than half (53.3%) receiving electricity [2], there is a dire need for sustainable solutions that can bridge these gaps. We recommend prioritizing investment in improved water supply systems, expanding renewable energy sources, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

### Key Findings:

* Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with water security (32.4% access), electricity access (53.3%), and renewable energy consumption ([VERIFY]%) [1].
* Climate change worsens these challenges by increasing variability in rainfall patterns and temperatures [2].

### Recommendations:

1. **Increase Investment in Water Supply Systems**:
	* Target: By 2030, increase access to safely managed drinking water from 32.4% to at least 50%.
	* Action Steps: Implement large-scale projects like solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds; provide subsidies for low-income households to install household-level water treatment systems.
	* Cost Estimate: [NEEDS SOURCE] million per year, with potential cost savings of [NEEDS SOURCE] billion due to reduced health care costs from improved sanitation [3].
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Sources**:
	* Target: By 2030, increase renewable energy consumption to at least 40% of total final energy consumption.
	* Action Steps: Develop and deploy solar-powered microgrids in rural communities; incentivize investment in solar panels through tax credits or grants for small businesses and households.
	* Cost Estimate: [NEEDS SOURCE] million annually, with potential cost savings from reduced reliance on fossil fuels [4].
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Strategies**:
	* Target: By 2030, enhance climate resilience by implementing early warning systems and drought-resistant crops in at least 75% of vulnerable regions.
	* Action Steps: Establish regional climate observatories to monitor rainfall patterns; provide training for farmers on climate-smart agricultural practices such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture.
	* Cost Estimate: [NEEDS SOURCE] million annually, with potential cost savings from reduced crop losses due to extreme weather events [5].

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by significant disparities in access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), with these rates far below global averages [6]. Climate change intensifies droughts, floods, and temperature variations, exacerbating existing challenges [7].

## Analysis

Access to safely managed drinking water is extremely limited in Sub-Saharan Africa (32.4%), affecting millions of people's health and well-being [8]. Electricity access remains low at 53.3%, particularly in rural areas where many lack basic amenities such as lighting and refrigeration for medicines [9]. Renewable energy consumption is only ([VERIFY]%) of total final energy consumption, far below global targets set by the United Nations (UN) to achieve sustainable development goals [10].

## Implementation Considerations

Practical steps include securing funding through international aid organizations and domestic government budgets. Potential barriers may arise from political resistance or lack of technical expertise in implementing these solutions.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation requires concerted efforts by governments, NGOs, and the private sector. By prioritizing sustainable development initiatives, we can improve living standards while contributing to global environmental goals. Let us act now to build a more resilient Sub-Saharan Africa.
