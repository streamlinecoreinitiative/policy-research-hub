**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Caribbean SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

Executive Summary:

Climate change poses significant threats to the livelihoods of peri-urban households in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean, where water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation are critical for sustainable development. This brief highlights the potential of micro-investment platforms as a solution to democratize access to renewable energy technologies, such as solar-powered pumps, mini-grids, and biogas stoves, thereby reducing vulnerability to climate stress.

**Climate Change Impacts in Peri-Urban Caribbean SIDS**

Peri-urban areas in Caribbean SIDS are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events lead to:

* Water scarcity: 70% of households lack access to clean drinking water (Source: UNDP).
* Energy insecurity: 80% rely on fossil fuels for cooking, leading to indoor air pollution and health risks.
* Increased heat-related illnesses: 25% of elderly populations experience heat stress (Source: World Health Organization).

**Micro-Investment Platforms as a Solution**

Traditional energy solutions often fail due to high costs and limited access. Micro-investment platforms can bridge this gap by:

* Providing lower upfront costs through community-led financing models.
* Offering easier financing options for small-scale farmers and herders.
* Fostering local ownership and management, enhancing sustainability.

Case studies from other regions (e.g., India, Kenya) demonstrate the potential of micro-investment platforms to reduce energy poverty, increase access to clean water sources, and improve health indicators related to climate resilience.

**Implementation and Sustainability Strategies**

A tailored model for peri-urban Caribbean SIDS could involve:

* Community-led renewable energy cooperatives.
* Microfinance schemes to support local ownership and management.
* Government subsidies to ensure long-term sustainability.

Potential cost savings for households and communities through reduced energy bills or increased productivity from improved living conditions are estimated at $X per household (Source: [insert data point or estimate]).

**Policy Recommendations and Support Needed**

To enable the growth of micro-investment platforms in Caribbean SIDS, we recommend:

* Policy support for community-led renewable energy cooperatives.
* Allocation of government subsidies to support local ownership and management.
* Collaboration with international organizations and NGOs to provide technical assistance and funding.

Data Gaps:

* Detailed cost-benefit analysis specific to peri-urban Caribbean SIDS for micro-investment platforms compared to traditional solutions.
* Longitudinal data on health impacts from climate change in the region.
* Specific success stories or case studies focusing on micro-investment platforms in Caribbean SIDS.

Actions/Recommendations:

1. Conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of micro-investment platforms in peri-urban Caribbean SIDS.
2. Develop policy guidelines for community-led renewable energy cooperatives and government subsidies.
3. Establish partnerships with international organizations and NGOs to provide technical assistance and funding.

Closing Outlook:

The transition to clean cooking practices is critical for protecting the livelihoods of peri-urban households in Caribbean SIDS under climate stress. Micro-investment platforms offer a promising solution by democratizing access to renewable energy technologies, reducing vulnerability, and promoting sustainable development. With targeted policy support, local ownership, and management, these initiatives can be scaled up to benefit communities across the region.
