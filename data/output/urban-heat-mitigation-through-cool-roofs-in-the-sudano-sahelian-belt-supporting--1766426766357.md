# urban heat mitigation through cool roofs in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent heatwaves and droughts. Urban areas within this region are particularly susceptible to heat-related stress due to high population density, inadequate infrastructure, and limited green spaces. This brief argues that cool roofs can play a crucial role in mitigating urban heat island effects, thereby supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By integrating cool roof technologies into urban planning strategies, cities in the Sudano-Sahelian belt can reduce their vulnerability to climate change and improve public health.

### Introduction

#### Background on Climate Change Impacts

*   The Sudano-Sahelian belt is characterized by:
    *   High temperatures: [verify] average annual temperature range of 25-30°C
    *   Limited rainfall: [verify] average annual rainfall of 800-1200 mm, with precipitation variability ranging from 600-1400 mm
    *   Increasing frequency and severity of heatwaves and droughts

#### Current Urban Heat Island Effects

*   Urban areas in the Sudano-Sahelian belt experience:
    *   Elevated temperatures: [verify] up to 5°C higher than surrounding rural areas
    *   Increased energy consumption for cooling
    *   Negative impacts on public health, including heat-related illnesses and mortality

### Cool Roofs as a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy

#### Benefits of Cool Roofs

*   Reduced urban heat island effects through:
    *   Albedo effect: reflecting solar radiation and reducing surface temperature
    *   Insulation effect: reducing heat gain from surrounding environment
*   Energy savings through reduced cooling demands
*   Improved public health outcomes by mitigating heat-related stress

#### Cool Roof Technologies

*   Available cool roof technologies include:
    *   White or light-colored roofing materials (e.g., reflective coatings, tiles)
    *   Green roofs and walls
    *   Radiative cooling systems

### Implementation and Policy Recommendations

#### Key Actions for Urban Planning and Policy-Makers

1.  **Integrate Cool Roofs into Urban Planning Strategies**: Incorporate cool roof technologies into building codes, urban planning guidelines, and infrastructure development projects.
2.  **Provide Incentives for Cool Roof Adoption**: Offer financial incentives, tax credits, or low-interest loans to encourage building owners and developers to adopt cool roof technologies.
3.  **Develop Capacity-Building Programs**: Provide training and capacity-building programs for architects, engineers, builders, and urban planners to ensure effective implementation of cool roof technologies.

### Closing Outlook

The integration of cool roofs into urban planning strategies can significantly contribute to climate change adaptation efforts in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By reducing urban heat island effects, energy consumption, and negative impacts on public health, cities in this region can become more resilient to climate change.
