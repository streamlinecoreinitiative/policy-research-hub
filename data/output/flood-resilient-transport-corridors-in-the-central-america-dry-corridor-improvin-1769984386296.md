# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Central America dry corridor: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Boosting Sub-Saharan Africa's Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience: A Comprehensive Policy Agenda**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in flood-resilient transport corridors. These infrastructure projects will not only improve health outcomes during heatwaves but also enhance economic development by reducing transportation costs and increasing access to markets. We estimate that implementing these recommendations will lead to a [VERIFY] reduction in mortality rates due to heat-related illnesses.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant barriers to accessing basic resources, particularly safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%). These challenges are exacerbated by a low renewable energy consumption rate of 19.7%, compared to global targets [1]. The region's population lacks access to reliable transportation networks, which hinders economic development and increases the risk of heat-related illnesses during heatwaves.

### Analysis

The current situation in Sub-Saharan Africa highlights significant gaps in meeting basic resource needs:

* **Water Security**: Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [2]. In contrast, globally, this rate is 73.7% (World Bank, 2024).
* **Clean Energy Access**: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 53.3% having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), compared to the global average of 91.6% (World Bank, 2023). The region's renewable energy consumption is just 19.7%, far below the world target of 20-25% by 2025 (World Bank, 2020).
* **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts are severe in Sub-Saharan Africa, with droughts and floods affecting millions of people's livelihoods.

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Invest in Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors**: Develop infrastructure projects that prioritize flood-resilient design to reduce the risk of transportation disruptions during heatwaves.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Access**: Invest in renewable energy projects such as solar panels and wind turbines to increase electrification rates. Provide subsidies for households and communities to make these technologies more accessible.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Establish early-warning systems and last-mile alerts for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events.

### Implementation Considerations

To ensure the successful implementation of these recommendations:

* **Cost Analysis**: Estimate costs associated with implementing flood-resilient transport corridors, renewable energy projects, and early-warning systems.
* **Potential Barriers**: Identify potential barriers such as limited funding, technical expertise, and community resistance. Develop strategies to overcome these obstacles.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges in accessing safe drinking water, electricity, and renewable energy require immediate attention and action. Implementing the recommended policy recommendations will lead to improved water security, enhanced clean energy access, and strengthened climate resilience. By taking decisive steps now, the region can build a more resilient and sustainable future.
