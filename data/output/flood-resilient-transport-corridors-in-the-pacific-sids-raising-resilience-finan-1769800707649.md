**Filling the Water Gap: Enhancing Access to Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a critical water scarcity crisis, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This policy brief argues that prioritizing clean energy investments and climate adaptation strategies is essential for enhancing water security, increasing electricity access, and bolstering renewable energy consumption. We recommend investing in water purification technologies, promoting solar-powered desalination plants, and implementing early-warning systems for droughts.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its limited resources for addressing these issues (World Bank Open Data, 2020). Over [VERIFY] million people lack access to safe drinking water, exacerbating existing challenges such as food insecurity and health risks during droughts (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). The region's electricity access rate is only 53.3% (World Bank Open Data, 2023), making it difficult for communities to access clean energy.

## Analysis

### Evidence on Water Security:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan African population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024).
* Global population lacking safe water: [VERIFY] billion people (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

### Evidence on Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation:

* Renewable energy consumption in the world: 19.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2020).
* Sub-Saharan Africa electricity access (% of population): 53.3% (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
	* Invest in water purification technologies and improve sanitation facilities.
	* Support community-led initiatives for rainwater harvesting and groundwater management.
2. **Enhance Renewable Energy Consumption**:
	* Promote solar-powered desalination plants to enhance access to clean drinking water in arid regions.
	* Invest in microgrids for off-grid communities to improve electricity access and reliability.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Implement early-warning systems for droughts using IoT devices and satellite imagery.
	* Develop climate-resilient agricultural practices and water management strategies.

## Implementation Considerations

Practical Steps:

* Establish partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to finance and implement these projects.
* Train community leaders in sustainable water resource management techniques.

Costs:

* Estimated cost for solar-powered desalination plants: [VERIFY] million per unit (estimated based on pilot project costs).
* Cost of microgrids: $50,000-$200,000 per installation (based on typical rural electrification projects in Sub-Saharan Africa).

Potential Barriers:

* Political resistance to change.
* High initial investment required for infrastructure development.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize clean energy and climate adaptation measures to enhance water security. By addressing these challenges now, we can create a more resilient future that supports sustainable growth and improved livelihoods for all citizens. Let us take decisive action today to ensure a secure tomorrow.
