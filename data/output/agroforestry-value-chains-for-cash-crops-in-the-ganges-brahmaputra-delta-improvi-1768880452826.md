# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Resilient Societies**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. To address these issues, we recommend implementing solar-powered wells to increase safe drinking water access, enhancing micro-insurance coverage for drought risk, and promoting agroforestry value chains in cash crops to enhance climate resilience.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with limited access to safe drinking water ([VERIFY] 32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), underscoring the need for immediate interventions. Renewable energy consumption is just [VERIFY] 19.7%, further straining resilience against climate change. According to World Bank data, only [NEEDS SOURCE] of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to safely managed drinking water, and only [NEEDS SOURCE] of countries in the region achieve electricity access.

### Analysis

The region's limited renewable energy use exacerbates its vulnerability to climate shocks. For instance, Sub-Saharan Africa is home to many of the world’s most vulnerable communities to droughts, floods, and other climate-related events. These challenges are compounded by inadequate access to clean water, leading to health issues such as waterborne diseases.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Solar-Powered Wells**: Implement solar-powered well projects in rural areas where grid electricity is unreliable or unavailable. This initiative can significantly increase safe drinking water access (World Bank, 2024). Estimated costs range from $100-$200 per household ([VERIFY] Consultancy Africa Intelligence, 2024).
2. **Enhance Micro-Insurance for Drought Risk**: Develop and implement micro-insurance schemes for smallholder farmers to mitigate financial risks associated with droughts. These measures are crucial given that only [NEEDS SOURCE] of Sub-Saharan African countries achieve electricity access (World Bank, 2023). Budget estimates for micro-insurance programs stand at $50 million/year ([VERIFY] World Bank, 2023).
3. **Promote Agroforestry Value Chains**: Encourage agroforestry value chains for cash crops like coffee and cocoa to enhance climate resilience. This approach not only supports livelihoods but also sequesters carbon, contributing to climate adaptation efforts.

### Implementation Considerations

- Budget estimates: $50 million/year for micro-insurance programs ([VERIFY] World Bank, 2023).
- Costs of solar-powered wells range from $100-$200 per household ([VERIFY] Consultancy Africa Intelligence, 2024).
- Potential barriers include limited financial resources and infrastructure constraints.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan African countries must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. By implementing targeted policies such as expanding solar-powered wells, enhancing micro-insurance for drought risk, and promoting agroforestry value chains, the region can build resilient societies. Immediate action is critical to reducing health risks, boosting economic productivity, and ensuring sustainable development.
