**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Caribbean SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the pressing need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges. Key findings include:

* 32.4% of the population lacks access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data).
* [VERIFY] 53.3% of the population lacks access to electricity (Note: This number is inconsistent with other data points; please verify source)
* Only 9.2% of freshwater withdrawal resources are used sustainably (World Bank Open Data).

To address these vulnerabilities, we recommend prioritizing investment in clean energy, promoting climate-resilient infrastructure, and enhancing water security measures.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to the world's largest number of people lacking access to safe drinking water (2.2 billion people) and electricity ([VERIFY] 53.3%) (UN-Water/WHO). The region's limited resources exacerbate climate change impacts, such as droughts and floods, leading to food insecurity, health crises, and economic instability.

## Analysis

* [NEEDS SOURCE] 74% of the global population lacks access to safely managed water.
* Inadequate infrastructure, frequent power outages, and climate-induced disruptions threaten livelihoods and public health.
* Renewable energy sources like solar power can be harnessed for clean electricity generation, reducing dependency on fossil fuels.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Integrate resilient infrastructure into national development plans** to ensure long-term sustainability.
2. **Invest in renewable energy projects** that provide sustainable and affordable electricity access.
3. **Promote water management practices**, such as rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment systems, to improve water quality and quantity.
4. **Implement climate adaptation measures**, including early warning systems for extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

* Collaborate with local communities, NGOs, and international partners to develop and implement sustainable projects.
* Estimated costs: [NEEDS SOURCE] $10 billion annually over 5 years for comprehensive clean energy and water security programs (Note: This number is inconsistent with other data points; please verify source).
* Potential barriers: Political instability, lack of institutional capacity, and inadequate funding may hinder implementation.

## Conclusion

Urgent investment in climate-resilient infrastructure is necessary to enhance water security, access to electricity, and climate adaptation. We urge governments, international organizations, and stakeholders to prioritize these recommendations and develop a multi-stakeholder framework for implementing them.
