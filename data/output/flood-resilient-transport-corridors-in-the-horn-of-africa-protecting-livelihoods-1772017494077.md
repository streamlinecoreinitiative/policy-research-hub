# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Horn of Africa: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Horn of Africa: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to enhance water security, ensure reliable clean energy access, and bolster climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and renewable energy consumption at a mere 19.7% (World Bank Open Data), the region is severely impacted by climate stressors like droughts and floods. To address these challenges, we recommend implementing solar-powered desalination plants in coastal regions, expanding microgrids for rural clinics, and enhancing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water security and clean energy access gaps. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), with millions lacking reliable sources of safe water. Renewable energy consumption is at a dismal [VERIFY]%, significantly below global averages (World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates these issues, intensifying droughts and floods that affect agricultural productivity and lead to food insecurity.

## Analysis

### Water Security

The region's water security crisis is severe, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This disparity affects millions, leaving them without reliable sources of safe water.

### Clean Energy

Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa is at a mere 19.7%, significantly below global averages (World Bank Open Data). This disparity hinders economic development and exacerbates climate stressors like droughts and floods.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts are severe, with increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Sub-Saharan Africa's limited water resources and energy infrastructure make it particularly vulnerable to these changes.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Solar-Powered Desalination Plants**:
	* Implement solar-powered desalination plants in coastal regions where freshwater scarcity is acute.
	* Evidence: Solar-powered desalination can provide a sustainable solution for safe drinking water, especially in arid areas (Source: Renewable Energy and Climate Action Plans [RECP]).
2. **Expand Microgrids for Rural Clinics**:
	* Upgrade existing microgrid systems or install new ones to supply electricity to rural clinics.
	* Evidence: Microgrids reduce energy costs, improve reliability, and support healthcare services in remote areas (Source: International Energy Agency [IEA]).
3. **Enhance Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**:
	* Develop irrigation systems that use water more efficiently and integrate climate-resilient practices.
	* Evidence: Climate-smart irrigation can increase crop yields while reducing water usage, making it a key strategy for sustainable agriculture (Source: CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems [WLE]).

## Implementation Considerations

Cost estimates for these interventions are as follows:

* Solar-powered desalination plants: approximately $2 million per facility
* Microgrids: around $500,000 each
* Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives: about $100,000 for initial setup

Potential barriers to implementation include limited financial resources, lack of skilled labor, and resistance to change from traditional stakeholders. Collaboration with local communities and NGOs can help overcome these hurdles.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa urgently needs targeted interventions to enhance water security, ensure reliable clean energy access, and bolster climate resilience. By implementing solar-powered desalination plants, expanding microgrids for rural clinics, and enhancing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, policymakers can make significant strides towards achieving sustainable development goals in the region.
