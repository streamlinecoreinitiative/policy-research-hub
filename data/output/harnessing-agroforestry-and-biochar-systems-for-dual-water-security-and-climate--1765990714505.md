# **Harnessing Agroforestry and Biochar Systems for Dual-Water Security and Climate Resilience in the Sahel Region**

**Harnessing Agroforestry and Biochar Systems for Dual-Water Security and Climate Resilience in the Sahel Region**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region is one of the most vulnerable to climate change, facing frequent droughts that severely impact water security and agricultural productivity. This brief highlights the potential of agroforestry systems and biochar to enhance soil health and water retention, providing a dual approach to climate resilience. Agroforestry systems combine tree crops with traditional farming practices, while biochar improves soil structure and increases water retention in arid soils. Combining both systems has shown synergistic effects, leading to increased crop yields and resilience to drought conditions. However, implementation challenges remain, including lack of funds and technical expertise. This brief provides recommendations for policymakers to support the adoption of agroforestry and biochar systems, emphasizing the need for community participation, technology transfer, and policy support.

**The Sahel Region's Vulnerability to Climate Change**

The Sahel region spans across several countries in West Africa, including Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Chad, and Senegal. This region is characterized by a semi-arid climate with limited rainfall, making it highly vulnerable to droughts and climate change. The impacts of climate change are already being felt, with frequent droughts, increased temperatures, and changing precipitation patterns affecting agricultural productivity and water security.

**Agroforestry Systems as Leading Interventions**

Agroforestry systems involve integrating trees into farming practices, providing multiple benefits including:

• Improved soil health through tree roots and leaf litter
• Increased crop yields due to shade and microclimate modification
• Enhanced biodiversity through habitat creation for wildlife
• Reduced soil erosion through root system stabilization

Case studies from the Sahel region demonstrate successful implementation of agroforestry systems. For example, in Burkina Faso, a project implemented by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) showed significant increases in maize yields and improved livelihoods for farmers.

**Biochar for Soil Health and Water Retention**

Biochar is a form of charcoal produced from organic matter, which can improve soil structure and increase water retention in arid soils. The benefits of biochar include:

• Improved soil fertility through nutrient retention
• Increased water holding capacity reducing runoff and erosion
• Enhanced crop yields due to improved soil health

Evidence from field trials shows that biochar applications lead to increased crop yields and resilience to drought conditions.

**Combining Agroforestry with Biochar: Synergistic Effects**

Integrating agroforestry systems with biochar has shown synergistic effects, leading to enhanced climate-resilient agriculture. Field trials demonstrate combined benefits over individual interventions, including:

• Increased crop yields due to improved soil health and water retention
• Enhanced resilience to drought conditions through improved soil structure and increased water holding capacity

**Challenges and Solutions in Implementation**

Common challenges faced during implementation include lack of funds, technical expertise, and community participation. Strategies to overcome these obstacles include:

• Community involvement in project design and implementation
• Technology transfer and training programs for farmers and extension agents
• Policy support through grants, infrastructure development, and regulatory frameworks

**Policy Recommendations for Promoting Agroforestry and Biochar Systems**

Key recommendations for policymakers include:

1. **Community-led initiatives**: Support community-led agroforestry and biochar projects to ensure ownership and sustainability.
2. **Technology transfer and training**: Provide training programs for farmers, extension agents, and policymakers on integrated agroforestry-biochar systems.
3. **Policy support**: Develop regulatory frameworks and provide grants for infrastructure development and technology transfer.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Support community-led initiatives to promote agroforestry and biochar adoption.
2. Provide training programs for farmers, extension agents, and policymakers on integrated agroforestry-biochar systems.
3. Develop policy support mechanisms through regulatory frameworks and grants for infrastructure development.
4. Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of combined agroforestry-biochar systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sahel region faces significant challenges due to climate change, but agroforestry and biochar systems offer a dual approach to enhance water security and agricultural productivity. By combining these two interventions, farmers can improve soil health, increase crop yields, and enhance resilience to drought conditions. Policymakers have a crucial role in supporting the adoption of integrated agroforestry-biochar systems through policy support, technology transfer, and community participation.
