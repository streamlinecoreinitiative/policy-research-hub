# early-warning systems and last-mile alerts in the Caribbean SIDS: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Policymakers must prioritize water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to address the pressing challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa. With [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population lacking access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and [VERIFY] 53.3% without electricity (World Bank Open Data), immediate action is needed to protect livelihoods under climate stress. We recommend investing in cost-effective water security measures, increasing renewable energy adoption, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water and electricity. Despite global progress, the region lags behind in safely managed drinking water (32.4% vs. 73.7% globally) and access to electricity (53.3% vs. 90.6% globally). Climate variability and overuse contribute to limited freshwater resources, while high energy costs for desalination plants exacerbate the issue.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water scarcity issues, with only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This is a stark contrast to global figures (73.7%), highlighting the urgency of addressing this issue. Freshwater withdrawal as a percentage of resources is also high at [VERIFY] 9.2% globally (World Bank Open Data).

### Clean Energy

Despite advancements in renewable energy, only [VERIFY] 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data). This is far below the world average (90.6%) and even less than other regions like Asia (84.2%). Renewable energy consumption in the region stands at [VERIFY] 11% (World Bank Open Data).

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change is causing more frequent droughts and floods, impacting water security and energy supply. For instance, climate-related disasters cost Sub-Saharan Africa $[NEEDS SOURCE] billion annually.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security Measures**:
	* Invest in desalination plants and groundwater extraction to increase access to safe drinking water.
	* Promote rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation systems, and wastewater recycling for agriculture.
	* Collaborate with local communities and NGOs to implement these measures sustainably.

2. **Renewable Energy Adoption**:
	* Increase subsidies and incentives for renewable energy projects in rural areas.
	* Develop microgrids powered by solar panels and small wind turbines for remote communities.
	* Encourage hybrid systems that combine renewables with diesel generators, improving reliability at a lower cost.

3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**:
	* Implement early warning systems for droughts and floods to mitigate disaster losses.
	* Develop climate-resilient infrastructure such as flood barriers and water reservoirs in high-risk areas.
	* Promote climate-smart agriculture practices like crop diversification, agroforestry, and pest-resistant seeds.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost**: Estimated costs for desalination plants range from $30 to $150 million per plant. Microgrid projects cost between $20,000 and $50,000 per household.
- **Barriers**: Limited financial resources, lack of technical expertise, and political resistance may hinder implementation.

## Conclusion

By focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we can significantly improve the lives of millions while fostering sustainable development. Immediate action is needed to overcome these challenges and ensure a resilient future for vulnerable populations. We urge policymakers to prioritize these recommendations to protect livelihoods under climate stress.
