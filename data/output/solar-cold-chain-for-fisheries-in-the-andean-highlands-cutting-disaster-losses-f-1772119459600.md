**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address the triple threat of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1] and a staggering 53.3% without electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023) [2], the region is facing unprecedented challenges. To bridge this gap, we recommend implementing policies that prioritize water security, clean energy solutions, and climate adaptation measures.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is the least developed region, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water compared to [VERIFY] globally (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Electricity access lags behind: Only 53.3% of people have access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa versus [VERIFY] worldwide (World Bank Open Data, 2023). The region is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to climate change and its adverse effects such as droughts and floods.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Despite progress, the continent remains far from achieving SDG 6 (clean water), with only [VERIFY] global coverage (UN SDG Report 2023). The region's freshwater withdrawal is a mere 9.2% of available resources (World Bank Open Data, 2021) [3].

### Clean Energy

The region's renewable energy consumption is less than a quarter of global levels at 19.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2020) [4], indicating significant room for improvement and investment.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts are severe, with frequent droughts and floods damaging infrastructure and livelihoods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in water harvesting systems**: Implement rainwater harvesting ponds to increase access to clean drinking water.
2. **Support solar-powered wells**: Provide subsidies for remote communities where traditional boreholes may be ineffective or costly.
3. **Promote clean energy solutions**: Encourage community-based solar power plants and small-scale renewable energy systems like biogas digesters and wind turbines in rural areas.

## Implementation Considerations

* Mobilize international development funds through grants and concessional loans from multilateral organizations like the World Bank and UN agencies.
* Engage with local NGOs, community groups, and private sector entities to ensure tailored, effective implementation.
* Train local communities in water management techniques, renewable energy maintenance, and climate change adaptation strategies.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is crucial for the well-being of Sub-Saharan African populations. By leveraging existing policies and new initiatives, we can significantly improve living conditions and foster sustainable development in this region. It is imperative that policymakers prioritize these interlinked challenges to ensure a more resilient future for millions of people.
