# early-warning systems and last-mile alerts in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Renewing Water Security, Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security (32.4% access to safely managed drinking water) [1] and electricity access (53.3%) [2]. Climate change intensifies these challenges, increasing risks of droughts and floods. To ensure sustainable development and resilience, we recommend immediate investments in renewable energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and community-based water management systems.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water (32.4%) [1] and electricity (53.3%) [2], exacerbating health issues and economic disparities. Climate change further strains already limited resources by increasing temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns. Rising temperatures and climate variability threaten water supplies and energy production, necessitating proactive adaptation measures.

## Analysis

### Evidence-Based Examination

* **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa has only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water [1], with a global average of 73.7% [3]. This disparity highlights significant gaps that require urgent attention.
* **Energy Access**: Despite the world achieving 91.6% electricity access in 2023 [4], Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at 53.3% [5], indicating substantial room for improvement.
* **Climate Impact**: Rising temperatures and climate variability threaten water supplies and energy production, necessitating proactive adaptation measures.

### Comparison of Approaches

Investing in renewable energy can reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance energy security. Climate-resilient infrastructure can mitigate the impacts of droughts and floods by ensuring water availability during times of scarcity. Community-based water management initiatives can promote local resilience through rainwater harvesting, small-scale irrigation projects, and waste-to-water recycling.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Investment**: Invest heavily in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to increase renewable energy consumption from the current 19.7% [6] to at least 30% by 2030.
2. **Climate Resilient Infrastructure**: Develop climate-resilient water management systems, including early warning systems for droughts and floods, and integrate climate change projections into infrastructure planning.
3. **Community-Based Water Management**: Encourage community-led initiatives such as rainwater harvesting, small-scale irrigation projects, and waste-to-water recycling to enhance local resilience.

## Implementation Considerations

* **Costs**: Initial investments in renewable energy infrastructure can be substantial but yield long-term savings through reduced reliance on imported fossil fuels.
* **Barriers**: Addressing climate change requires overcoming political resistance and securing adequate funding. Engaging with local communities is crucial for successful implementation of community-based water management initiatives.

## Conclusion

Policymakers must prioritize investments in renewable energy, resilient infrastructure, and community-led solutions to ensure sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Establishing a dedicated climate resilience fund and collaborating across sectors can accelerate progress towards meeting global and regional SDG targets for water security and clean energy.
