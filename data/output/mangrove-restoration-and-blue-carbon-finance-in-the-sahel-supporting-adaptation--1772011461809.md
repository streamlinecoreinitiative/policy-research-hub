# mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance in the Sahel: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To strengthen water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives in the Sahel region. This approach can help countries achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement while promoting sustainable development. Specifically, we propose:

* Investing $100 million in a regional mangrove restoration program to enhance coastal resilience and promote blue carbon sequestration.
* Establishing a blue carbon financing mechanism to mobilize an additional [VERIFY] million for climate adaptation projects in the Sahel.

These initiatives will not only support adaptation targets but also contribute to achieving SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring water security, promoting clean energy access, and building climate resilience. The region's unique environmental context, characterized by high population density in arid regions, frequent droughts, and limited financial resources for infrastructure projects, necessitates tailored solutions.

According to the World Bank Open Data, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in accessing safely managed drinking water, with only 68.5% of the population having access [Source: World Bank Open Data]. The region's renewable energy consumption is also far below the SDG target, at 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data].

Climate change exacerbates these vulnerabilities, with projected temperature increases threatening agricultural productivity and freshwater availability. The IPCC AR6 reports a global temperature rise of +1.1°C since pre-industrial times [Source: IPCC AR6].

## Analysis

The analysis highlights the importance of addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa.

* **Access to safely managed drinking water**: Despite progress (74% global coverage), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at 68.5% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Barriers include inadequate sanitation facilities, lack of hygiene education, and insufficient financial resources for infrastructure development.
* **Renewable energy consumption**: Only 19.7% of total final energy consumption in the region is from renewables, far below the SDG target (32%) [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Climate adaptation**: Vulnerable communities face increasing risks from climate-related disasters such as floods and droughts, with limited resources available for early warning systems, disaster preparedness, and community resilience building.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives**:
	* Allocate $100 million to a regional mangrove restoration program to enhance coastal resilience and promote blue carbon sequestration.
	* Establish a blue carbon financing mechanism to mobilize an additional [VERIFY] million for climate adaptation projects in the Sahel.
2. **Enhance access to safely managed drinking water**:
	* Implement cost-effective water treatment technologies in rural areas, promote rainwater harvesting, and increase funding for sanitation infrastructure.
3. **Promote clean energy adoption**:
	* Invest in renewable energy projects (wind, solar), provide subsidies or incentives for electricity access, and strengthen policy frameworks that support private sector investments in clean energy.

## Implementation Considerations

Funding constraints are a significant challenge. We recommend utilizing existing development funds (e.g., World Bank, UN agencies) and seeking additional grants from international donors to support these initiatives.

Technological limitations can be addressed through collaboration with research institutions for technological innovation and pilot projects before scaling up.

Community engagement is essential to ensure that solutions are contextually relevant and sustainable. Local communities should be engaged in decision-making processes to guarantee the success of these initiatives.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges require a multi-faceted approach involving water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation measures. By prioritizing mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives, countries can accelerate progress towards achieving SDG targets while promoting sustainable development. We urge governments, international donors, and stakeholders to support these efforts by investing in evidence-based solutions that leverage existing data and resources.
