# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Food Security and Disaster Resilience

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions globally, with millions relying on agriculture and water resources for their livelihoods. Climate change has exacerbated existing challenges such as erratic rainfall patterns, flooding, and droughts, putting immense pressure on the region's fragile ecosystem.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges

### Water Security

*   **Water scarcity**: Erratic rainfall patterns, increased evaporation due to rising temperatures, and inefficient irrigation systems have resulted in severe water scarcity. [Verify]
*   **Flooding and droughts**: Climate change has led to more frequent and intense flooding and droughts, further exacerbating the region's vulnerability.

### Clean Energy

*   **Renewable energy adoption**: Renewable energy adoption remains limited due to high upfront costs, lack of infrastructure, and policy barriers.
*   **Energy efficiency**: Existing irrigation systems often rely on diesel generators, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

### Climate Adaptation

*   **Agricultural resilience**: Smallholder farmers face significant challenges in adapting to climate change due to limited access to resources, information, and markets.
*   **Climate-resilient infrastructure**: Existing infrastructure is often inadequate or poorly maintained, making it difficult for communities to recover from disasters.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Solution

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution by:

1.  **Improving water retention**: Agroforestry practices enhance soil health and increase water retention.
2.  **Reducing erosion**: Agroforestry helps to reduce soil erosion, maintaining fertile land and preventing sedimentation in rivers.
3.  **Increasing energy efficiency**: Micro-hydro systems can provide clean energy.

## Policy Recommendations

*   **Integrate climate-resilient practices**: Encourage farmers to adopt agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems through training programs and incentives.
*   **Improve infrastructure**: Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant buildings and irrigation canals.
*   **Promote renewable energy adoption**: Implement policies supporting the adoption of renewable energy sources.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment** to identify areas with the greatest potential for climate-resilient school feeding supply chains.
2.  **Develop a training program** for farmers on agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, focusing on installation and maintenance.
3.  **Establish partnerships** between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector organizations to provide funding and technical assistance.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta are crucial for ensuring food security and reducing disaster losses among vulnerable groups. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into existing infrastructure, we can create a more sustainable and resilient future for this region.
