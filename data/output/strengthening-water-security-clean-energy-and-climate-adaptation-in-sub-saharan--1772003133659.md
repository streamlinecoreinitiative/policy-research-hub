# Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa

**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend a three-pronged approach:

1. **Enhanced Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest $200 per person in infrastructure projects like water wells and purification systems to improve access to safe drinking water in regions with the highest deficits.
2. **Accelerated Renewable Energy Deployment**: Increase investment in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower by 20% annually for the next five years, promoting private sector investments while providing incentives for public utilities to adopt cleaner technologies.
3. **Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development**: Develop climate-resilient infrastructure projects like flood-resistant roads and green roofs to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events on water security and energy systems.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water (73.7% globally in 2024) [1] and electricity (53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2023) [2]. Limited renewable energy consumption at 19.7% of total final energy consumption underscores the region's dependence on non-renewable sources, exacerbating environmental degradation. Climate change is intensifying droughts and floods, with global temperature rise exceeding +1.1°C since pre-industrial times (IPCC AR6) [3], affecting agricultural productivity and water availability.

### Analysis

The challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa are compounded by the need for sustainable solutions that address both immediate needs and long-term environmental sustainability. Access to safe drinking water remains a critical issue, with significant disparities across regions. For instance, only 74% of global populations have access to safely managed drinking water (SDG 6 progress report 2023) [4], highlighting the urgent need for interventions in underserved areas.

Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind globally in electricity access, with only about half of its population having access (53.3%), contributing significantly to energy poverty and environmental degradation. Renewable energy consumption is also low at 19.7%, indicating a substantial gap between current use and potential for sustainable development.

Climate change impacts are evident, with increased frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods affecting water security and agricultural productivity. For example, the global population lacking safe water stands at [VERIFY] people (UN-Water/WHO), underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive adaptation measures.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in infrastructure projects like water wells and purification systems to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Target regions with highest deficits through targeted subsidies or grants.
2. **Accelerated Renewable Energy Deployment**:
	* Increase investment in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower by 20% annually for the next five years.
	* Promote private sector investments while providing incentives for public utilities to adopt cleaner technologies.
3. **Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development**: Develop climate-resilient infrastructure projects like flood-resistant roads and green roofs.

### Implementation Considerations

- Cost estimates: Initial investment in water infrastructure could range from $100-$500 per person depending on technology used [5]. Renewable energy deployment might require larger upfront costs but offers long-term savings through reduced dependency on fossil fuels.
- Potential barriers: High initial costs, lack of skilled labor, and regulatory hurdles need to be addressed through targeted subsidies or public-private partnerships.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa needs immediate and sustained efforts to enhance water security, promote clean energy access, and build climate resilience. By implementing the recommended policies, we can significantly improve living conditions and ensure sustainable development for future generations. Collaboration among governments, NGOs, and international organizations is essential to overcome institutional and financial barriers.
