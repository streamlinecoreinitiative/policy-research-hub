# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Horn of Africa: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4%) [1] and electricity (53.3%) [2], exacerbating vulnerabilities to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods. To address these pressing issues, governments and international partners must implement robust water management strategies, expand renewable energy sources, and enhance climate adaptation measures. This policy brief recommends investing in water infrastructure projects, increasing investments in renewable energy, and promoting climate-resilient infrastructure design.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by diverse ecosystems, but faces significant threats from human activities. Climate change intensifies droughts and floods, leading to water scarcity and extreme weather events [3]. Limited access to clean energy exacerbates health risks and hinders economic growth [4]. Poor infrastructure and weak governance hinder effective adaptation measures, making communities more vulnerable.

### Analysis

**Water Security**

* Sub-Saharan Africa has a significant population lacking safe drinking water (32.4%) [1].
* Only 51% of the region's fresh water resources are used sustainably [2].
* Climate change threatens to increase water stress and reduce availability, necessitating improved water management strategies.

**Clean Energy Access**

* Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest access to electricity among regions (53.3%) [2].
* Renewable energy consumption is less than a quarter of total final energy consumption globally (19.7%) [5].
* High costs and limited infrastructure hinder widespread adoption, particularly in remote areas.

**Climate Adaptation**

* Sub-Saharan Africa experiences frequent droughts and floods.
* Climate change projections suggest more severe weather events leading to food insecurity and economic instability [6].
* Limited climate adaptation measures exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, requiring urgent action.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security**
	* Invest in water infrastructure projects such as wells, pipelines, and rainwater harvesting systems ($10-$50 per capita annually) [7].
	* Implement water management policies that prioritize equitable access to safe drinking water.
	* Promote sustainable agricultural practices to reduce demand on freshwater resources.
2. **Clean Energy Access**
	* Increase investments in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
	* Develop supportive policies for private sector participation in clean energy projects.
	* Support electrification of rural areas through off-grid solutions and mini-grids ($20-$60 per household per year) [8].
3. **Climate Adaptation**
	* Implement early warning systems to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events.
	* Promote climate-resilient infrastructure design, such as flood barriers and drought-resistant crops.
	* Enhance public education campaigns on climate change adaptation measures among vulnerable populations.

### Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Water security projects can cost $10-$50 per capita annually. Clean energy access initiatives may range from $20-$60 per household per year, depending on technology and scale [9].
* Barriers: High initial costs for infrastructure projects can deter investments. Limited institutional capacity to implement policies and manage resources efficiently.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must take immediate action on water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience to build a more resilient future. By implementing the recommended policy measures, governments can create sustainable development pathways that protect vulnerable populations while fostering economic growth. Collaboration between nations, international organizations, and local communities is essential for successful implementation.

**Call to Action**: Governments should prioritize funding and resource allocation towards water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa. NGOs and development partners must support these efforts with tailored interventions and technical assistance.
