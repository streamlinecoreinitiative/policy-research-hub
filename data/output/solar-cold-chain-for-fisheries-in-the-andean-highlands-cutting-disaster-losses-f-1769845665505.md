**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Andean Highlands: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief emphasizes the need to enhance water security, promote clean energy adoption, and adapt to climate change. By focusing on these critical areas, governments can significantly reduce disaster losses and improve living conditions for millions of vulnerable people. We recommend investing in water infrastructure and renewable energy projects.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing severe challenges related to water security and clean energy access. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), and limited renewable energy consumption hinders economic growth (19.7%, World Bank Open Data). These issues exacerbate climate vulnerability, leading to increased health risks, economic losses, and social unrest.

## Analysis

Access to safe drinking water is a significant challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This disparity is most pronounced in rural areas where sanitation facilities are scarce. Renewable energy consumption also lags behind, with a mere [VERIFY] % of the region's energy coming from renewable sources.

Climate vulnerability is further intensified by frequent droughts and floods, which have increased crop failures and water scarcity issues. The global population lacking safe water stands at an alarming 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO), with Sub-Saharan Africa being one of the most affected regions.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Invest in water harvesting systems, such as rainwater catchment ponds, to increase access to clean water in rural areas (Source: UN-Water/WHO).
	* Implement subsidies for low-income households to purchase affordable water filters and purification kits.
2. **Promote Clean Energy**:
	* Introduce tax incentives and grants for renewable energy projects, particularly solar-powered desalination plants and micro-grids for off-grid communities.
	* Collaborate with international partners like the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to develop regional solar power grids.
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**:
	* Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods using satellite imagery and local meteorological data.
	* Encourage community-based disaster risk reduction programs, including school education on climate change adaptation.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in water infrastructure and renewable energy projects are estimated at $50 million annually. Addressing the barriers of political instability, corruption, and lack of skilled labor will require capacity building initiatives and robust governance frameworks. A monitoring system should be established to track progress against set targets and adjust policies as needed.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience to achieve sustainable development goals. By adopting the recommended policy interventions, decision-makers can significantly improve living conditions for millions while contributing to global sustainability efforts.
