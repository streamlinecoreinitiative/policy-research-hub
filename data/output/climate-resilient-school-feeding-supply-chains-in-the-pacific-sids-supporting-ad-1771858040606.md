**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Pacific SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

In the Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), climate change poses a significant threat to food security, water availability, and energy access. To address these challenges, we recommend that governments and development partners prioritize investments in climate-resilient school feeding supply chains. This approach can enhance adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) while improving the nutritional well-being of students.

**Key Challenges:**

* 32.4% of households in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to safely managed drinking water [1].
* Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% globally, with significant potential for growth [2].
* **[VERIFY] 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe water** [NEEDS SOURCE]

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces pressing environmental challenges:

* Limited access to electricity (53.3%) and safely managed drinking water (32.4%) [1, 4].
* Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of global resources, with increasing demand due to population growth [5].
* Climate change exacerbates these issues, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns threatening food security and energy access.

## Analysis

Recent studies highlight the need for targeted interventions:

* Community-led total sanitation programs have improved water security in several regions [6].
* Solar-powered wells have increased access to safe drinking water in rural areas [7].

However, challenges persist due to:

* Limited infrastructure and funding for renewable energy projects.
* Climate variability affecting agricultural productivity and food availability.

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains, we recommend the following:

1. **Invest in community-led total sanitation programs** to improve water security and reduce the risk of water-borne diseases.
2. **Promote off-grid solar solutions** for remote areas with limited access to electricity.
3. **Subsidize the cost of purchasing and installing solar panels** in rural communities to increase renewable energy consumption.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure successful implementation, we recommend:

* Community engagement and training programs for local technicians.
* Public awareness campaigns to promote the benefits of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains.
* Collaboration with international development agencies to secure funding for these initiatives.

## Conclusion

Climate change poses a significant threat to food security, water availability, and energy access in Pacific SIDS. By prioritizing investments in climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, governments and development partners can enhance adaptation targets outlined in NDCs while improving the nutritional well-being of students.

**Call to Action:** Governments and development partners should prioritize investments in climate-resilient school feeding supply chains to support adaptation targets in NDCs.
