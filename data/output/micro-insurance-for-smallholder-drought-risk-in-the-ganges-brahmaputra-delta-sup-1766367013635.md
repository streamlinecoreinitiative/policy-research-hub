# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

Executive Summary:

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, with frequent floods and droughts affecting smallholder farmers' livelihoods. This brief proposes micro-insurance as a crucial component for supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in lower-income countries like Bangladesh. By providing financial protection against drought-related losses, micro-insurance can enhance the resilience of smallholder agriculture.

**I. Introduction to Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture**

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and increased frequency of extreme events. The region's average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify]. Traditional irrigation systems suffer from significant water losses: evaporation accounts for a significant portion, while seepage amounts to around 5%.

**II. Current Irrigation Practices and Their Limitations**

Traditional irrigation methods in the region are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy [verify], while canal systems lose a substantial amount of water due to evaporation and seepage. The economic impact assessment reveals that cost per hectare for traditional methods is high, posing a significant burden on smallholder farmers.

**III. Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems can enhance soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making them more resilient to climate change impacts. Benefits of agroforestry include:

* Soil organic matter increases [verify]
* Biodiversity increase [verify]
* Carbon sequestration [verify]

Case studies from other regions demonstrate successful implementation of agroforestry systems.

**IV. Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Key benefits include:

* Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system [verify]
* Energy efficiency is around 70-80% [verify]

**V. Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. Key highlights include:

* Total project cost per hectare is $10,000-$25,000 [verify]
* Return on investment (ROI) is around 3-5 years [verify]

**VI. Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions, while future research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability.

Recommendations:

1. Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
2. Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
3. Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future Research Directions:

1. Economic impact assessments of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
2. Community acceptance studies and benefits derived from these systems
3. Long-term sustainability evaluations

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Governments in lower-income countries should prioritize policy measures to support the adoption of micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk.
2. International organizations and development agencies should provide technical assistance and financial support for scaling up integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. Further research is needed to validate the long-term impacts and sustainability of these solutions.

**Closing Outlook:**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for addressing drought-related risks in smallholder agriculture. By providing financial protection against drought losses, micro-insurance can enhance the resilience of farmers, ensuring food security and sustainable development. This brief highlights the importance of supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs through innovative solutions like micro-insurance and integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
