# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Great Lakes Region: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region faces climate change impacts, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased water scarcity. This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to address severe water scarcity in school feeding supply chains.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts

Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, droughts, and increased water scarcity in the Great Lakes region (1). This affects agriculture, food security, and economic stability. Reliable access to clean water is essential for student health and well-being in school feeding supply chains.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems rely on boreholes or canals, which are prone to water loss through evaporation and seepage (2). This inefficiency exacerbates water scarcity issues and hampers agricultural productivity. Traditional irrigation methods do not account for climate variability, making them vulnerable to droughts and floods.

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion and water loss (3). Integrating trees into agricultural landscapes enhances water retention, reduces runoff, and promotes more efficient use of rainfall. This approach contributes to climate resilience by promoting ecosystem services that mitigate the impacts of climate change.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology harnesses small-scale hydroelectric power to generate electricity for irrigation systems (4). This approach reduces reliance on diesel generators, decreases energy costs, and increases irrigation efficiency. Integrating micro-hydro with agroforestry ensures reliable access to clean water while promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation (5). These integrated solutions offer significant economic benefits, including reduced energy costs and increased water efficiency. They also contribute to broader sustainable development goals by promoting ecosystem services and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale:

1.  Develop policy frameworks that incentivize integrated agriculture-water management practices.
2.  Provide technical assistance to farmers and school administrators on implementing these solutions.
3.  Conduct further research on the economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Develop policy frameworks that incentivize integrated agriculture-water management practices.
2.  Provide technical assistance to farmers and school administrators on implementing these solutions.
3.  Conduct further research on the economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are essential for ensuring student health and well-being in the face of climate change. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, schools can promote sustainable agriculture practices while safeguarding freshwater ecosystems.
