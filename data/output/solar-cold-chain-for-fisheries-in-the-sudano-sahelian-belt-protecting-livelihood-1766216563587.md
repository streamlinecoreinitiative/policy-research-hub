# Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Enhancing Resilience under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts and erratic rainfall patterns that impact agricultural productivity and food security. The fisheries sector, a vital source of livelihood for many communities, is particularly susceptible to climate-related stressors. This brief examines the potential of solar-powered cold-chain systems for enhancing resilience in fisheries.

## Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity in the region, affecting agriculture, livestock, and fisheries. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns alter the hydrological cycle, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation systems often rely on boreholes or canals, prone to water loss through evaporation and seepage. This inefficiency exacerbates water scarcity, making it challenging for farmers and fishers to maintain their livelihoods.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while enhancing water retention and reducing erosion. Integrating trees into agricultural landscapes can build resilience to climate-related stressors and promote sustainable land use.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for improving irrigation efficiency in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. Small-scale hydroelectric systems provide clean energy for pumping water, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects demonstrate the potential of integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to enhance climate resilience in irrigation. These integrated approaches can improve water retention, reduce erosion, and promote sustainable land use while providing clean energy for pumping.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries:

1.  **Invest in renewable energy infrastructure:** Governments and development partners should prioritize investments in micro-hydro technology and other renewable energy sources to reduce reliance on diesel generators.
2.  **Promote agroforestry practices:** Extension services and agricultural programs should promote agroforestry practices as a means to enhance soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
3.  **Support climate-resilient irrigation systems:** Governments and development partners should support the development of climate-resilient irrigation systems that integrate micro-hydro technology and agroforestry practices.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of solar-powered cold-chain systems with agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies offers a promising solution for enhancing resilience in fisheries. By investing in these integrated approaches, governments and development partners can help communities build climate resilience and protect their livelihoods.
