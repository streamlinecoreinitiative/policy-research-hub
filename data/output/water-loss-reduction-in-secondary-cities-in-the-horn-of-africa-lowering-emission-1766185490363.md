# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Horn of Africa: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa faces severe water scarcity due to climate change, affecting agricultural productivity and food security in lower-income countries. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in the Ethiopian Highlands, a critical agricultural region.

## Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in Ethiopia

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands through erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from highland wetlands. Rising temperatures alter growing seasons, reducing crop yields and affecting food quality (UN Environment Programme, 2020). The World Bank reports that climate-related shocks have significant impacts on agricultural productivity, leading to poverty among smallholder farmers (World Bank, 2019).

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration in the Ethiopian Highlands. Studies show that agroforestry systems can reduce erosion by up to [verify] % and increase water retention by up to [verify] % (Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture, 2018). Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution for irrigation efficiency.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale:

1. **Develop policy frameworks** that incentivize investment in renewable energy and climate-resilient agriculture.
2. **Provide technical assistance** to farmers and communities on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro practices.
3. **Conduct socioeconomic studies** on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.

Future research directions include:

1. **Long-term climate data analysis** for selected highland regions in Ethiopia.
2. **Detailed cost-benefit analyses** comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Scaling up pilot projects** to demonstrate the economic viability of these integrated solutions.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for climate-resilient irrigation in the Ethiopian Highlands. To address water scarcity and reduce emissions from critical sectors, it is essential to develop policy frameworks that support the adoption of these sustainable practices at scale.

**Data Gaps:**

1. Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia.
2. Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
