**Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy, Resilient Water Security and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa face significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. This policy brief recommends integrating solar-powered water pumping systems with renewable energy for irrigation and early warning systems for droughts and floods. By focusing on these interventions, governments can improve livelihoods while reducing disaster risks.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 10% of the global population but only [VERIFY] % have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This disparity is exacerbated by climate change, leading to more frequent droughts and floods. Without robust energy and water infrastructure, communities face severe challenges in maintaining basic needs and sustaining economic activities.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: In Sub-Saharan Africa, only [VERIFY] % of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This disparity is most pronounced among rural populations who rely on traditional sources like boreholes or rivers.
- **Energy Access**: Only [VERIFY] % of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has electricity access (World Bank Open Data, 2023). Electricity shortages affect nearly half the region's inhabitants and hinder economic productivity and social services.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Integrate Renewable Energy with Water Supply**:
   - **Solar-Powered Wells**: Implement solar-powered water pumps in rural areas to provide safe drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024).
   - **Renewable Energy Integration**: Utilize solar power for irrigation systems to improve agricultural productivity and resilience against climate shocks.

2. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
   - **Early Warning Systems**: Establish early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events (NOAA Climate Data). Early warnings can help communities prepare and mitigate the impacts of these disasters.
   - **Drought-Resistant Crops**: Promote crop varieties that are more resilient to climate change conditions such as drought and salinity. Support farmers in adopting these crops through training programs and financial assistance.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Costs**:
   - Solar-powered water pumps can cost between $2,000-$5,000 per well (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Scaling up the number of wells requires significant investment.
   - Early warning systems typically require an initial setup cost and ongoing maintenance. The cost varies by country but generally ranges from [VERIFY] to [VERIFY] for a basic system.

2. **Potential Barriers**:
   - High initial costs may deter governments and investors from implementing these solutions.
   - Limited technical expertise in renewable energy integration can hinder successful project implementation.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa require immediate attention on improving water security and access to clean energy, which will not only address basic needs but also foster economic growth. By integrating solar-powered water pumps with climate adaptation measures like early warning systems for droughts, governments can create a more resilient future for their populations.

### Background Information

**Environment**

The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally, including physical and biological factors along with their chemical interactions that impact on any organism or a group of organisms (Wikipedia).

**Resilience**

Resilience refers to the ability of an individual, community, organization, or system to withstand, recover from, or quickly adapt in the face of adverse conditions such as natural disasters, economic crises, or other disruptions (Wikipedia).
