# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Pacific SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The clean cooking transition is crucial for peri-urban households in the Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), where energy access and climate change mitigation are pressing concerns. This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation, which can enhance water security and renewable energy use while improving agricultural resilience for vulnerable communities.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges

### Water Security and Climate Change Impacts

*   Erratic rainfall patterns lead to reduced water availability.
*   Increased evaporation from wetlands exacerbates water scarcity issues.
*   High labor costs [verify] for constructing and maintaining irrigation systems.
*   High fuel costs [verify] for diesel generators.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

*   Traditional Systems:
    *   Boreholes and canals used for water delivery.
    *   30% loss of water due to poor canal design (evaporation and seepage).
*   Economic Costs:
    *   Diesel generator maintenance costs [verify].

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Climate-Resilient Solution

### Soil Health Benefits and Biodiversity Enhancement

*   Improved soil structure with increased moisture retention.
*   Examples of successful agroforestry projects demonstrating improved water retention and reduced erosion.
*   Increased biodiversity leading to natural pest control and pollination services.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency and Energy Savings

*   Renewable energy source for irrigation systems (e.g., reduction in diesel generator usage).
*   Examples of successful micro-hydro projects showing improved water delivery.
*   Savings from reduced reliance on diesel generators [verify].

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

### Subsidies, Grants, and Infrastructure Development

*   Government subsidies for initial investment in micro-hydro system installation [verify].
*   Community-led micro-hydro system installations with local government support.

### Long-term Sustainability Assessments and Community Engagement Strategies

*   Monitoring period to ensure long-term benefits from integrated systems.
*   Participatory decision-making processes (e.g., farmer-led irrigation committees) and joint decision-making committees involving farmers, government officials, and environmental experts.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Develop and implement policies supporting the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation**.
2.  **Provide subsidies and grants to communities for initial investments in micro-hydro system installation**.
3.  **Establish community-led micro-hydro system installations with local government support**.
4.  **Conduct long-term sustainability assessments and develop community engagement strategies**.

## Closing Outlook

The clean cooking transition is a critical component of the Pacific SIDS' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to address climate change. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation, these countries can enhance water security and renewable energy use while improving agricultural resilience for vulnerable communities.
