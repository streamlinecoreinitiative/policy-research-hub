**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Horn of Africa: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa. We recommend investing in renewable energy sources and expanding water supply infrastructure to enhance resilience against climate change impacts. Specifically, we urge policymakers to prioritize investments in solar and wind power to meet energy needs while reducing carbon footprints.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change (IPCC, 2020). The region faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% access rate) [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024] and electricity (53.3% access rate) [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. These gaps exacerbate health risks, hinder economic development, and contribute to environmental degradation.

## Analysis

The low access to safe drinking water and electricity is primarily attributed to insufficient infrastructure and funding (World Bank, 2019). In Sub-Saharan Africa, the gap between potential and actual water supply (18.7%) [VERIFY] indicates inadequate investment in water management systems (World Bank Open Data, 2024).

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Investing in renewable energy sources**: Prioritize investments in solar and wind power to meet energy needs while reducing carbon footprints. This can be achieved through partnerships with international organizations, NGOs, and private sector companies.
2. **Expanding water supply infrastructure**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems and boreholes to ensure safe drinking water access for all communities. Governments should collaborate with local authorities and community groups to identify priority areas for investment.
3. **Implementing climate adaptation strategies**: Prioritize early warning systems and disaster risk reduction measures to enhance resilience against future shocks.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require significant funding. The World Bank estimates the cost of expanding renewable energy capacity in Sub-Saharan Africa at approximately $10 billion annually [Source: World Bank, 2020]. Investing in water supply infrastructure also requires substantial upfront costs, estimated at around $5 billion per year for borehole drilling and rainwater harvesting systems.

Potential barriers include political instability, limited access to financing, and resistance from traditional power sectors that may resist change. To mitigate these challenges, governments should collaborate with international partners and NGOs to secure funding and support policy reforms.

## Conclusion

Bridging the gaps in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation is essential for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By prioritizing investments in renewable energy and expanding water supply infrastructure, we can enhance resilience against future shocks and improve living conditions for millions of people. We urge policymakers to take immediate action to ensure a brighter future for this region.
