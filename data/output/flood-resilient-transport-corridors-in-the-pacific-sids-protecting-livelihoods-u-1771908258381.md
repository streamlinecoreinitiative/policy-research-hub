**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Pacific SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance flood-resilient transport corridors in the Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). With only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to reliable electricity, and 32.4% lacking safely managed drinking water [1], the region is particularly vulnerable to climate-related shocks. Investing in flood-resilient infrastructure, such as sea walls and early warning systems, can significantly reduce the impact of flooding on transport corridors and protect livelihoods. We recommend that governments prioritize investments in flood-resilient transport corridors, particularly in coastal areas where flooding is most prevalent.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with significant gaps in access to clean water, electricity, and climate-resilient infrastructure. As of 2024, only [VERIFY] % of the region's population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], while 53.3% lack reliable electricity [2]. These disparities not only threaten health outcomes but also impede economic development. Climate-related shocks like droughts and floods further strain infrastructure and services, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa's inadequate water supply is a major concern, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This disparity contributes to poor sanitation and health outcomes, affecting millions of people in poverty [3].

### Clean Energy Access

Electricity access remains low at 53.3%, affecting economic productivity and social services [2]. Sub-Saharan Africa's reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation exacerbates environmental degradation, contributing to climate change vulnerabilities.

### Climate Adaptation

The region is particularly vulnerable to climate-related shocks such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. These challenges strain existing infrastructure and services, further limiting resilience [1].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors**:
	* Invest in sea walls and early warning systems for coastal areas where flooding is most prevalent.
	* Promote the use of flood-resilient materials and designs for transport infrastructure, such as bridges and roads.
2. **Increased Clean Energy Access**:
	* Implement renewable energy projects, such as solar-powered wells for remote communities, reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
	* Develop microgrids in rural areas to enhance electricity reliability and affordability.
3. **Climate Resilience Measures**:
	* Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure like sea walls and early warning systems for coastal flooding.
	* Promote agroforestry practices that integrate trees into farming systems, enhancing soil health and reducing vulnerability to droughts.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost**: Initial investments in flood-resilient transport corridors can be substantial but yield long-term benefits through improved infrastructure.
- **Barriers**: Limited funding, technical expertise, and political will pose challenges. Overcoming these requires collaborative efforts between governments, NGOs, and international partners.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for creating sustainable communities. By implementing targeted interventions, we can significantly improve the quality of life for millions of people while fostering economic growth and environmental sustainability. Collaboration across sectors and with international partners will be essential to achieving these goals.
