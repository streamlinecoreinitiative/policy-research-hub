# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sahel: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sahel: Enhancing Disaster Resilience**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region is highly vulnerable to landslides, posing significant risks to human life and property. Climate change exacerbates these risks through increased rainfall intensity and frequency, soil degradation, and loss of vegetation cover. This brief explores nature-based solutions that integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to address landslide risk in the Sahel.

**Section 1: Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries**

The Sahel region is characterized by low rainfall, high temperatures, and increasing desertification. Climate change further exacerbates these conditions through more frequent and intense droughts and floods. Nature-based solutions that promote environmental resilience are critical for reducing disaster losses and improving livelihoods.

*   **Water Security:** [Verify] 2 billion people worldwide face water scarcity issues, with the Sahel region being one of the most vulnerable areas.
*   **Clean Energy:** Renewable energy sources can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change impacts. Micro-hydro systems offer a feasible solution due to abundant water resources in the Sahel.

**Section 2: Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems provide a sustainable solution for irrigation and energy generation. This approach integrates agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric systems, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

*   **Benefits of Agroforestry:** Agroforestry promotes soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion and improving water retention.
*   **Micro-Hydro Systems:** Micro-hydro technology offers a reliable and efficient solution for irrigation, with benefits including reduced water loss through evaporation and seepage.

**Section 3: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems. These projects show significant potential for scaling up to address landslide risk and improve livelihoods for vulnerable groups.

*   **Economic Analysis:** Cost-effectiveness analysis shows that agroforestry-micro-hydro projects can be financially viable, with potential for long-term benefits.
*   **Policy Recommendations:** Governments and international organizations should support the adoption of these systems at scale through policy frameworks and funding mechanisms.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Develop and implement policies to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in the Sahel region.
2.  Conduct further research on socioeconomic impacts, community engagement, and long-term climate data relevant to the Sahel region.
3.  Provide technical assistance and funding for pilot projects demonstrating the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for reducing landslide risk in the Sahel region. By promoting environmental resilience, improving livelihoods, and addressing climate change impacts, this approach can contribute to sustainable development goals. Further research and policy support are necessary to scale up these solutions and ensure their long-term effectiveness.
