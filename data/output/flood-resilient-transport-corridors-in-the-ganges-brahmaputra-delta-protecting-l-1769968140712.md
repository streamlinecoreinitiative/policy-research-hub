**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary
The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and climate-vulnerable regions globally, with frequent floods affecting over 40 million people annually. To mitigate these impacts, we recommend investing in flood-resilient transport corridors that integrate green infrastructure, such as mangrove forests and wetlands, into transportation planning. This approach can reduce flood risks while supporting economic growth and poverty reduction.

## Context & Challenge
The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical economic hub for Bangladesh and India, with the majority of their trade passing through this region. However, climate change is exacerbating flood risks, with projected increases in sea levels and extreme precipitation events (IPCC, 2021). The current transportation infrastructure is largely inadequate to withstand these stresses, resulting in significant losses to agriculture, industry, and human settlements.

## Analysis
- **Flood Risks**: Over 40 million people are affected by floods annually in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta [NEEDS SOURCE].
- **Transportation Infrastructure**: The majority of transportation infrastructure in the region is vulnerable to flooding, with up to 30% of roads and bridges damaged or destroyed during flood events (ADB, 2020).
- **Economic Impacts**: Floods result in significant economic losses, estimated at over $1 billion annually [NEEDS SOURCE].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors**: Develop a national strategy for integrating green infrastructure into transportation planning, focusing on mangrove forests and wetlands.
2. **Green Infrastructure Investments**: Allocate funds to support the development of flood-resilient transport corridors, including investments in green infrastructure, such as mangrove restoration and wetland conservation [NEEDS SPECIFIC AMOUNT].
3. **Community Engagement**: Engage local communities in the planning and implementation process to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed.
4. **Capacity Building**: Provide training and capacity-building programs for transportation officials and engineers on flood-resilient design and construction practices.

## Implementation Considerations
The implementation of these recommendations requires a multi-stakeholder approach involving government agencies, NGOs, and private sector partners. Key considerations include securing adequate funding, ensuring regulatory frameworks support sustainable practices, and building capacity for monitoring and evaluation.

## Conclusion
Investing in flood-resilient transport corridors is critical to protecting the livelihoods of millions of people living in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By integrating green infrastructure into transportation planning, we can reduce flood risks while supporting economic growth and poverty reduction. We urge governments and development partners to prioritize this critical investment.
