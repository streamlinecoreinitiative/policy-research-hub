**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief emphasizes the need to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) [1] and less than half enjoying electricity (53.3%) (World Bank Open Data) [2], these challenges are critical barriers to development. To address this, we recommend investing in modernizing existing water supply systems, promoting renewable energy technologies, and developing comprehensive climate adaptation plans.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's development trajectory is hindered by inadequate water security, limited clean energy access, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. The region lacks the resources needed to support its growing population’s basic needs, exacerbating existing disparities. Inadequate water management leads to health issues and economic losses (WHO/UNICEF, 2020) [3], while low electricity access hinders industrial growth and education (World Bank Open Data). Renewable energy is underutilized, posing a missed opportunity for sustainable development.

## Analysis

The data reveals stark contrasts between Sub-Saharan Africa's current state and global benchmarks:

- **Access to Drinking Water:** Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) [1], compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank Open Data) [1].
- **Electricity Access:** Electricity access is even more limited, with only 53.3% of residents having access (World Bank Open Data) [2]. This disparity is particularly pronounced given the region's vast potential for renewable energy generation.
- **Renewable Energy Consumption:** The world’s share of renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7%, and Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind, with no data available specifically on this indicator.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Infrastructure:**
	* Invest in modernizing existing water supply systems, including building wells and providing piped water connections.
	* Implement rainwater harvesting ponds and improve sanitation facilities.
	* The World Bank reports that only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) [1]. This project should focus on extending these services where they are most needed.

2. **Promote Renewable Energy:**
	* Encourage the deployment of renewable energy technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric systems.
	* Establish policies that incentivize investment in clean energy projects, including tax breaks and grants for households and businesses.
	* The World Bank indicates a 19.7% share of total final energy consumption from renewables globally (World Bank Open Data) [4]. Sub-Saharan Africa could significantly increase this percentage through targeted initiatives.

3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies:**
	* Develop comprehensive climate adaptation plans that incorporate early warning systems, drought-resistant crops, and infrastructure improvements such as flood barriers and irrigation systems.
	* Collaborate with international partners to share best practices and technology for enhancing resilience against climate change impacts like erratic rainfall patterns and rising temperatures (NOAA Climate Data) [5].

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs:** Initial investments in water infrastructure might range from $10 million to $20 million per project, depending on the scale of operations. Renewable energy projects can cost between $5 million to $10 million.
- **Barriers:** Potential challenges include limited financial resources, technical expertise, and regulatory hurdles. Address these by leveraging existing frameworks such as the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) support for green energy projects or regional development banks’ grants and loans.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to foster sustainable growth and reduce poverty. By implementing the recommended policy measures, decision-makers can make substantial progress towards meeting these critical goals. Collaboration among governments, NGOs, and international organizations is essential for successful implementation of these strategies.
