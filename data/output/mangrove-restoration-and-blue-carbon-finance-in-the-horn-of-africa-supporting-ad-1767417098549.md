# Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity, drought, and desertification. National Determined Contributions (NDCs) emphasize adaptation measures for enhanced resilience. This brief explores mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance as a complementary approach to support NDC targets in the region.

## I. Introduction

### Water Scarcity in the Horn of Africa

Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity, affecting agriculture, food security, and economic stability due to erratic rainfall patterns, droughts, and increased evaporation from rising temperatures.

### Importance of Resilient Irrigation Methods

Resilient irrigation methods are crucial for ensuring food security and economic stability. However, existing systems often rely on non-renewable energy sources, leading to high operational costs and environmental degradation.

## II. Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance

### Benefits of Mangrove Ecosystems

Mangrove ecosystems provide numerous benefits:

• **Carbon Sequestration:** Mangroves are efficient carbon sinks.
• **Water Filtration:** Mangroves act as natural filters, improving water quality and reducing sedimentation in rivers and coastal areas.
• **Shoreline Protection:** Mangrove roots stabilize shorelines, protecting against erosion and storm damage.

### Blue Carbon Finance Opportunities

Blue carbon finance initiatives can provide a new revenue stream for communities to restore and conserve mangrove ecosystems. This approach involves:

• **Carbon Credit Generation:** Communities generate carbon credits by restoring or conserving mangrove forests.
• **Revenue Sharing:** A portion of the revenue generated from carbon credit sales is shared with local communities, promoting sustainable livelihoods.

## III. Supporting NDC Targets

### Alignment with NDC Goals

Mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives can support NDC targets in several ways:

• **Enhancing Resilience:** Mangroves help build resilience to climate-related shocks.
• **Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods:** Blue carbon finance initiatives create new revenue streams for communities, promoting sustainable livelihoods and reducing poverty.

### Case Studies and Best Practices

Several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance in supporting NDC targets:

• **Kenya's Mangrove Restoration Efforts:** Kenya has made significant strides in restoring its mangrove forests through community-led initiatives.
• **Tanzania's Blue Carbon Finance Program:** Tanzania has implemented a blue carbon finance program, generating revenue for communities while promoting sustainable livelihoods.

## IV. Recommendations and Actions

### Short-Term Actions:

1.  Conduct a thorough assessment of the region's mangrove ecosystems to identify areas with high restoration potential.
2.  Develop a comprehensive plan for implementing blue carbon finance initiatives in collaboration with local communities.
3.  Establish partnerships with international organizations, NGOs, and private sector entities to support the initiative.

### Long-Term Recommendations:

1.  Integrate mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance into national climate policies and NDCs.
2.  Develop a regional framework for promoting sustainable livelihoods through blue carbon finance initiatives.
3.  Establish a monitoring and evaluation system to track progress and adapt strategies as needed.

## Closing Outlook

Mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance offer a promising approach to support adaptation targets in the Horn of Africa's NDCs. By promoting resilient livelihoods, enhancing ecosystem services, and generating revenue for communities, these initiatives can contribute significantly to regional climate resilience.

Changes made:

- Removed speculative claims regarding mangroves storing "up to 2-3 times more carbon than terrestrial forests" as it lacks a specific source.
- Kept the title consistent with the outline.
- Preserved the length of the brief while refining language for clarity and concision.
