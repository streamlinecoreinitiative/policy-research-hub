# Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Ethiopian Highlands

## Executive Summary

Climate change has significantly impacted agriculture in the Ethiopian Highlands, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and severe water scarcity. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, resulting in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to address these challenges.

## Current Irrigation Practices in the Ethiopian Highlands

Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns in the Ethiopian Highlands, resulting in severe water scarcity. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, with borehole pumps consuming [verify] kWh/day and canal systems losing 30% due to evaporation and 5% through seepage.

### Key Data Points

* Average annual rainfall of 800-1200 mm with a precipitation variability range from 600-1400 mm.
* Water loss percentages from traditional irrigation systems:
	+ Evaporation: 30%
	+ Seepage: 5%

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. In regions such as West Africa and East Africa, successful implementation of agroforestry systems has improved crop yields and reduced erosion.

### Key Data Points

* Benefits of agroforestry:
	+ Soil organic matter increases by 2-8% [verify].
	+ Biodiversity increase by 15-30 native species.
	+ Carbon sequestration by 3-7 tons/ha/year.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation. These systems have been shown to be efficient, with power generation ranging from [verify] kW per system and an energy efficiency of 70-80%.

### Key Data Points

* Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system.
* Energy efficiency is at 70-80%.
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective solutions for climate-resilient water supply. The total project cost per hectare is estimated to be $10,000-$25,000 [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

### Key Data Points

* Total project cost per hectare: $10,000-$25,000.
* Return on investment (ROI): 3-5 years.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Incentives for farmers, grid integration with micro-hydro systems, and infrastructure development are key recommendations.

### Key Data Points

* Incentives for farmers: subsidies, low-interest loans.
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities).

## Closing Outlook

The proposed integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro system can provide a sustainable solution to water scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands. Further research is required to assess the long-term sustainability and economic impact of these systems.

### Needed Evidence

1. **Climate Data:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Ethiopia (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Economic Analysis:** Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3. **Socioeconomic Studies:** Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct further research on the economic impact of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop policy measures to support the adoption of these systems, including incentives for farmers and grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
3. Implement infrastructure development projects (roads, storage facilities) to facilitate the adoption of these systems.
