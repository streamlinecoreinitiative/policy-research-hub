# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance resilience in lower-income countries, particularly in the context of climate change. The recent data shows that only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), and just 53.3% have access to electricity (World Bank Open Data). To address these gaps, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy sources, enhancing water infrastructure, and promoting climate-resilient agricultural practices.

## Context & Challenge

Climate change is disproportionately affecting lower-income countries, with limited resources for adaptation. The lack of access to clean water and electricity exacerbates poverty and hinders progress towards sustainable development goals (UN SDG Report 2023). In the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable to droughts and heatwaves, which can have severe implications for public health and economic stability.

## Analysis

The statistics paint a dire picture:

* Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data).
* Just [VERIFY] 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).
* The global average for safely managed drinking water is [SOURCE: World Bank Open Data] 73.7%, while [SOURCE: World Bank Open Data] 91.6% of the world's population has access to electricity.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy**: Increase renewable energy consumption from [VERIFY] 9.2% to 15% by 2030, aligning with SDG 7 targets (World Bank Open Data).
2. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**: Implement water supply and sanitation projects in underserved areas to improve access to safe drinking water from 32.4% to 50% by 2030.
3. **Promote Climate-resilient Agriculture**: Invest in drought-resistant crop varieties, irrigation systems, and climate monitoring tools for smallholder farmers.

## Implementation Considerations

To implement these recommendations, we suggest:

* Developing national-level plans with clear timelines and budgets.
* Collaborating with local communities to ensure projects are sustainable and responsive to needs.
* Allocating [NEEDS SOURCE] $1 billion per year for renewable energy infrastructure and [NEEDS SOURCE] $20 million annually for water supply improvements.

## Conclusion

The urgent need to address the critical gaps in clean water and electricity access cannot be overstated. We must develop comprehensive plans that integrate renewable energy solutions with climate-resilient agriculture practices. Prioritize these interventions within national development strategies, and initiate pilot projects in key regions to gather lessons learned and scale up successful initiatives.
