# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sahel: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region faces significant water scarcity and climate-related challenges, threatening food security and economic stability for millions of people. Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are crucial to address these issues, ensuring students have access to nutritious meals while promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

**Climate Change Impacts on Water Scarcity and Agriculture**

The Sahel region is experiencing severe water scarcity due to climate change, leading to reduced crop yields, increased water stress, and decreased food security. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns exacerbate these challenges.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Sahel region include boreholes, canals, and traditional rainwater harvesting methods. However, these systems face significant challenges:

• **Water loss:** [Verify] evaporation and seepage from existing irrigation systems.
• **Energy dependence:** Diesel generators are often used for pumping water, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
• **Limited access:** Many communities lack access to reliable and efficient irrigation systems.

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry:

• **Improves water retention:** Trees help retain moisture in the soil.
• **Enhances crop yields:** Agroforestry practices increase crop diversity and yields.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution to irrigation challenges:

• **Reduced energy reliance:** Micro-hydro systems generate electricity from water flow, reducing dependence on diesel generators.
• **Increased efficiency:** [Verify] micro-hydro systems can achieve high efficiency in water use.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have successfully integrated agroforestry with micro-hydro systems:

• **Cost-effectiveness:** Integrated solutions reduce costs by minimizing energy consumption.
• **Scalability:** These solutions can be replicated across the Sahel region, promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support adoption at scale:

1.  Develop policies to incentivize the use of micro-hydro systems in irrigation.
2.  Establish training programs for farmers on agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies.
3.  Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and scalability.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are essential for addressing water scarcity and climate-related challenges in the Sahel region. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can provide sustainable solutions that promote renewable energy adoption, improve food security, and reduce poverty.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  Develop policies to incentivize the use of micro-hydro systems in irrigation.
2.  Establish training programs for farmers on agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies.
3.  Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and scalability.

**Needed Evidence Snippets:**

1.  World Bank Report: "Renewable Energy Consumption in Mexico," focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).
2.  Mexican Ministry of Agriculture Publication: "Agroforestry Practices and Their Impact on Water Management" (case studies from the Mesoamerican Highlands).

**Key Data Points Needed:**

1.  Average Annual Rainfall in Selected Highland Regions
2.  Specific Water Loss Percentages from Existing Irrigation Systems
3.  Cost Estimates and Financial Viability Analysis for Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Projects

Changes made:

- Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
- Removed speculative claims that are not evidence-backed.
- Preserved the title, which is specific to the topic.
- Kept length similar.
- Removed fabricated numbers (e.g., 30% evaporation and 5% seepage).
- Removed unnecessary words and phrases for a more formal tone.
