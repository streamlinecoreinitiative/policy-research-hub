**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance water security, promote clean energy solutions, and foster climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), and renewable energy consumption at a mere [VERIFY] 19.7% of total final energy consumption (World Bank, 2020), urgent action is required to bridge these gaps. To address these challenges, we recommend prioritizing the following measures:

* Enhance water infrastructure investments through public funding and community-led initiatives for sustainable water management practices.
* Promote renewable energy adoption by subsidizing installation costs, providing training programs for installers, and developing microgrid solutions.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in terms of water security and access to electricity. The continent lags behind other global regions with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This disparity impacts health outcomes significantly, as contaminated water sources contribute to diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever. Electricity access is also unevenly distributed, affecting economic productivity and social services.

## Analysis

The challenges in water security and clean energy are exacerbated by climate change impacts. Extreme weather events such as droughts and floods have become more frequent and severe, threatening freshwater resources and infrastructure. For example, the World Meteorological Organization reports that Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a [VERIFY] 50% increase in extreme rainfall events since 1980 (WMO, 2023). These climate shocks necessitate robust adaptation measures to ensure sustainable water management practices.

## Policy Recommendations

To address water security and clean energy challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, government officials and development practitioners should prioritize the following measures:

1. **Enhanced Water Infrastructure Investments**: Increase public funding to upgrade existing water systems and expand access to safe drinking water through infrastructure projects such as boreholes and rainwater harvesting systems (World Bank, 2024). Implement community-led initiatives for sustainable water management practices.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the use of solar energy by subsidizing installation costs and providing training programs for installers. Develop microgrid solutions to improve electricity access in underserved rural areas. Support policies that incentivize renewable energy projects, such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits (World Bank, 2023).
3. **Climate Resilient Agriculture Programs**: Invest in climate-smart agricultural practices like agroforestry and water-efficient irrigation systems. These programs not only enhance food security but also reduce the environmental footprint of farming operations.
4. **Community Engagement and Education**: Promote public awareness campaigns about safe drinking water practices, proper waste disposal methods, and sustainable energy use. Engage local communities in decision-making processes to ensure that solutions are locally relevant and effective (World Bank, 2024).

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a concerted effort from both government and private sector stakeholders. Public-private partnerships can be leveraged to pool resources and expertise for project execution. Cost considerations must also be addressed through targeted funding mechanisms such as grants or concessional loans.

Potential barriers include limited financial resources, inadequate institutional capacity, and regulatory hurdles. Addressing these challenges will require strategic planning, collaboration between different sectors, and sustained political commitment over the long term.

## Conclusion

By focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, Sub-Saharan Africa can significantly improve living standards while contributing to broader global efforts toward sustainability. The recommended policy actions are feasible given existing data and resources, offering a clear path forward for transformative change in the region.
