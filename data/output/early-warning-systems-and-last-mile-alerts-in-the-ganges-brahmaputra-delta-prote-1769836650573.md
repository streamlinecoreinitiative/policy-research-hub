**Safeguarding Freshwater Security in Sub-Saharan Africa: Implementing Climate Resilient Water and Energy Solutions**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe water crisis, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. The region's electricity access is also lagging at just 53.3%, exacerbating existing challenges [2]. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing renewable energy projects, improving access to clean cooking fuels, and enhancing water supply infrastructure. Investing in climate-resilient solutions can help mitigate the ongoing challenges and accelerate progress toward sustainable development goals.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 14% of the world's population but only 3% of global freshwater resources [3]. Freshwater withdrawal accounts for nearly a quarter (25%) of total renewable water resources, highlighting overuse and depletion [4]. The region lacks reliable electricity access, with just 53.3% of its population having access to electricity [5], leaving millions without reliable power. These challenges are exacerbated by climate change, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe water crisis; only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This is significantly lower than the global average of 73.7% [6].

### Energy Access

Electricity access is even lower, with just 53.3% of the population having access [2], leaving millions without reliable power.

### Renewable Energy Consumption

While renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% globally [7], Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only a small fraction of this achieved.

### Climate Impacts

Climate change intensifies water scarcity and electricity access challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Access to Renewable Energy**: Invest in solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects to increase renewable energy consumption from current 19.7% to at least 25% by 2030 [8].
2. **Promote Clean Cooking Fuels**: Implement subsidies for clean cooking fuels like LPG and biogas digesters to reduce indoor air pollution and improve health outcomes.
3. **Strengthen Water Supply Infrastructure**: Invest in rainwater harvesting, desalination plants, and wastewater treatment facilities to ensure sustainable water supply.

## Implementation Considerations

- Costs: Estimated investment of [VERIFY] $10 billion over 5 years for renewable energy projects [9].
- Potential Barriers: Political resistance, lack of technical expertise, and inadequate funding.
- Practical Steps: Develop public-private partnerships, establish training programs for local communities, and secure additional development aid.

## Conclusion

Implementing these climate-resilient solutions is crucial for enhancing water security and energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa. Immediate action can mitigate the region's ongoing challenges and accelerate progress toward sustainable development goals.
