**Climate Resilient Water Security and Renewable Energy in Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Community Livelihoods**

## Executive Summary

To address the severe water scarcity, unreliable electricity supply, and climate-induced shocks facing Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend increasing investment in community-led rainwater harvesting systems, promoting renewable energy integration through local solar PV projects, and supporting climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives. These evidence-based solutions can be implemented at scale to meet SDG 6 (water) and promote renewable energy access. By prioritizing these interventions, governments, international organizations, and local communities can enhance livelihoods while contributing to broader sustainable development goals.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in terms of water security and energy access. According to the World Bank (2024), only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of 73.7% [1]. In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, this percentage drops to 53.3% for electricity access, despite having more than half of the world’s renewable energy potential (World Bank, 2020) [2]. Climate change is intensifying these challenges by causing more frequent droughts and power outages. For instance, a study by UN-Water/WHO (2022) found that 2.2 billion people globally lack access to safe water [3].

## Analysis

The region’s limited access to clean water sources and unreliable electricity supply contribute significantly to poverty and malnutrition. According to the World Bank (2024), only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity, compared to 91.6% globally [1]. This disparity is further compounded by climate-related events such as droughts and floods that disrupt water supply systems and power generation facilities.

Renewable energy sources like solar PV have great potential for addressing both electricity access and climate resilience challenges. However, integrating these technologies requires significant upfront costs and may face technical limitations due to cloudy or rainy conditions. Community-led initiatives can help bridge this gap by leveraging local resources and knowledge. For instance, microgrids powered by solar PV can provide reliable off-grid electricity solutions in rural areas.

Climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives also offer a promising solution for sustainable water management. These cooperative-based systems allow farmers to share resources like water pumps and storage facilities, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. A case study from the Lower Mekong Delta found that climate-smart irrigation cooperatives not only improved crop yields but also enhanced community resilience against future shocks (World Bank, 2021) [4].

## Policy Recommendations

To accelerate progress towards SDG 6 and promote renewable energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa:

1. **Increase Investment in Water Infrastructure**: Governments should allocate more funds to improve water infrastructure such as rainwater harvesting systems. These can be implemented at the community level with minimal external support, reducing costs and increasing ownership.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration**: Encourage local solar PV projects by providing subsidies or grants for installation. This will help reduce electricity costs for rural communities and enhance energy security during power outages caused by climate events.
3. **Support Climate Resilient Irrigation Cooperatives**: Develop policies that support the establishment of cooperative-based irrigation systems, including shared water storage facilities and improved pumping technologies. These cooperatives can be established through public-private partnerships to leverage additional resources.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require overcoming several barriers such as high initial costs for infrastructure development and technical challenges in climate-resilient energy solutions. Governments should consider engaging with local communities, NGOs, and private sector entities to facilitate implementation. Collaboration is key to ensuring the sustainability of initiatives like rainwater harvesting systems and microgrids.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and renewable energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted efforts from governments, international organizations, and local communities. By adopting evidence-based interventions such as community-led rainwater harvesting, solar-powered microgrids, and climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives, the region can achieve significant improvements in livelihoods while also contributing to broader sustainable development goals.

**Call to Action**: Governments should prioritize investments in water security and renewable energy access through targeted policies and public-private partnerships. International organizations and donor countries must provide financial support and technical assistance to facilitate these initiatives. Community leaders play a crucial role in mobilizing resources and ensuring the sustainability of climate-resilient solutions.
