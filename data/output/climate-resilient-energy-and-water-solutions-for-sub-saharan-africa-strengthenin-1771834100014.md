# Climate Resilient Energy and Water Solutions for Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Adaptation Efforts

**Climate Resilient Energy and Water Solutions for Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Adaptation Efforts**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water scarcity and energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1] and less than 50% have access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023). To strengthen adaptation efforts, governments should prioritize climate-resilient energy and water solutions by implementing microgrids for rural clinics and early-warning systems. These interventions can protect health outcomes, support community resilience, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with severe water scarcity, where only a small fraction of the population has access to safe drinking water. This is exacerbated by climate change, which leads to more frequent droughts and floods (IPCC, 2021). Similarly, less than half of the region's population enjoys electricity, which is essential for climate adaptation and resilience efforts.

## Analysis

The statistics are clear: only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [2], while access to electricity is limited at just 53.3% (World Bank Open Data, 2023). In comparison, the global average for safely managed drinking water coverage is 73.7% (World Bank Open Data), and 91.6% for access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Implement microgrids for rural clinics**: Develop and deploy microgrid systems in rural clinics to ensure reliable power supply during emergencies like floods or droughts. This will protect health outcomes and support community resilience.
2. **Invest in early-warning systems**: Implement early-warning systems that provide last-mile alerts for critical sectors like agriculture. These systems can help farmers make informed decisions to mitigate climate risks, such as planting crops more resilient to changing weather patterns.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing microgrids for clinics will require significant initial investments in infrastructure and technology. However, the long-term benefits of protecting health outcomes can outweigh these costs (World Bank Open Data, 2023). Governments should consider public-private partnerships or grants from international development agencies to overcome limited access to financing and technical expertise.

## Conclusion

Governments must prioritize climate-resilient energy and water solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa. By focusing on microgrids for clinics and early-warning systems, they can enhance the resilience of communities under climate stress. We urge governments to develop detailed implementation plans, seek funding from international partners, and monitor progress to ensure these initiatives are effective in improving both water security and energy access.
