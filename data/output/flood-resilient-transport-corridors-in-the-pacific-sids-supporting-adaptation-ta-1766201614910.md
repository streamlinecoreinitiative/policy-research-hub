# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Pacific SIDS: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in Pacific SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to climate change, facing frequent natural disasters and rising sea levels that threaten their existence. Flood-resilient transport corridors are crucial for these countries' economic development and adaptation efforts.

**Introduction to Water Scarcity in Lower-Income Countries**

Water scarcity is a pressing issue in many lower-income countries, particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. Climate change has exacerbated this problem by altering rainfall patterns and reducing water availability for agriculture.

**Climate-Resilient Irrigation Methods in Lower-Income Countries**

1.  **Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**
    *   Existing irrigation systems suffer from water loss through evaporation and seepage.
2.  **Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**
    *   Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while enhancing water retention and reducing erosion.
3.  **Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**
    *   Micro-hydro technology offers reduced reliance on diesel generators and increased energy efficiency.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, showcasing potential for scaling up. Economic analysis is needed to support policy recommendations for widespread adoption.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation methods in lower-income countries:

*   Develop policies that incentivize the use of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
*   Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for farmers, policymakers, and other stakeholders.
*   Conduct further research on economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability.

**Closing Outlook**

Flood-resilient transport corridors in Pacific SIDS require innovative solutions to enhance adaptation targets in NDCs. Integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into irrigation practices can provide a sustainable solution for water security and renewable energy use.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Develop policies that incentivize the use of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for farmers, policymakers, and other stakeholders.
3.  Conduct further research on economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability.
