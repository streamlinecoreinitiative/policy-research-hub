# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by frequent droughts and extreme weather events. Peri-urban households face significant challenges in accessing clean energy and water security, exacerbating poverty and food insecurity. This brief argues that transitioning to clean cooking practices and improving water management can mitigate disaster losses for vulnerable groups.

## Water Security and Clean Energy in the Central America Dry Corridor

The region is prone to droughts, floods, and landslides due to climate change (IPCC, 2019). Peri-urban households rely heavily on traditional cooking methods that are often inefficient and polluting. The use of biomass fuels contributes to indoor air pollution, affecting household members' health (WHO, [verify]).

### Current Challenges

*   Limited access to clean energy sources
*   High reliance on biomass fuels for cooking
*   Inadequate water management practices leading to water scarcity

## Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems: A Sustainable Solution

Agroforestry systems can improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion (FAO, 2018). Integrating micro-hydro technology with agroforestry can provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation and renewable energy adoption.

### Benefits of Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Systems

*   Improved water retention and reduced erosion
*   Increased energy efficiency and reduced reliance on diesel generators
*   Enhanced soil health and biodiversity

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale, we recommend:

1.  Developing policies to incentivize clean cooking practices and renewable energy adoption.
2.  Providing training and capacity-building programs for farmers and communities on sustainable agriculture practices.
3.  Conducting further research on the economic impact and community acceptance of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

### Needed Evidence

To support our argument, we require:

1.  Climate data on rainfall patterns and temperature trends in the Central America dry corridor.
2.  Economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3.  Socioeconomic studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Develop policies to incentivize clean cooking practices and renewable energy adoption.
2.  Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers and communities on sustainable agriculture practices.
3.  Conduct further research on the economic impact and community acceptance of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, with peri-urban households facing significant challenges in accessing clean energy and water security. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation and renewable energy adoption. We recommend developing policies to incentivize clean cooking practices and renewable energy adoption, providing training and capacity-building programs for farmers and communities, and conducting further research on the economic impact and community acceptance of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
