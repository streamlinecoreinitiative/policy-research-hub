# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in Caribbean SIDS: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts

## Executive Summary

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity and landslides in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Caribbean, threatening food security and economic stability. This brief proposes nature-based solutions to mitigate landslide risk and ensure resilient irrigation systems for agriculture.

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems are integrated to provide efficient and sustainable water supply, leveraging renewable energy sources. By addressing immediate challenges and contributing to broader sustainable development goals, this approach ensures long-term food security and economic benefits.

## Climate Change Impacts on Water Scarcity in Caribbean SIDS

Climate change alters precipitation patterns, leading to droughts and increased landslide risk in the Caribbean. Rising temperatures affect agriculture, reducing crop yields and impacting livelihoods [verify]. Severe water scarcity threatens food security, economic stability, and community resilience.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

*   Existing irrigation systems experience high water loss percentages due to evaporation and seepage.
*   Limited access to electricity and diesel generators exacerbates the issue, increasing operational costs.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration [verify]. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry enhances water retention and reduces erosion, making it a crucial component of climate-resilient irrigation systems.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology leverages small-scale hydroelectric systems to reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency. This approach promotes renewable energy adoption in the region [verify].

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects showcase the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro, highlighting cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

### Economic Analysis and Policy Recommendations

Economic analysis demonstrates the financial viability of integrated solutions. Key policy recommendations include:

*   Supporting adoption through subsidies and incentives
*   Encouraging community engagement and participation in decision-making processes
*   Developing and implementing regulations to ensure long-term sustainability

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Investigate and document existing agroforestry-micro-hydro projects** in the Caribbean SIDS, highlighting successes and challenges.
2.  **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** supporting adoption of integrated solutions at scale.
3.  **Conduct socioeconomic studies** to better understand community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated approaches.

## Closing Outlook

Nature-based solutions, such as agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, offer a promising approach for mitigating landslide risk and ensuring resilient irrigation in the Caribbean SIDS. By addressing immediate challenges and contributing to broader sustainable development goals, this approach ensures long-term food security and economic benefits.

### Needed Evidence:

*   NOAA Climate Dataset: Specific regions in the Caribbean (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
*   World Bank Reports:
    *   "Renewable Energy Consumption in Mexico" focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).
    *   "Access to Electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa," providing data on electricity access (% of population).

### Rationale Summary:

This proposal focuses on integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to water scarcity and poverty, ensuring economic benefits and sustainability. Key data points will validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these solutions, informed by existing research and best practices from similar regions.
