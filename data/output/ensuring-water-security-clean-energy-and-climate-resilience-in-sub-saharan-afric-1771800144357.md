# Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security and clean energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1] and less than half have reliable electricity [2]. To enhance resilience against future climate shocks, we recommend implementing targeted policies to improve access to electricity and safe drinking water while promoting renewable energy use.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security and clean energy access. The region's population growth is projected to increase by over 50% by 2050 [3], exacerbating existing resource constraints. Climate change further threatens water availability, with projections indicating a decrease in rainfall in some areas [4]. These issues not only impact daily lives but also hinder economic growth and sustainable development goals.

### Analysis

Recent data from the World Bank indicates that Sub-Saharan Africa's access to safe drinking water is among the lowest globally. The region lags behind other continents in terms of renewable energy consumption at just 9.2% [5]. These statistics underscore the need for urgent action to enhance resilience and ensure sustainable development.

### Policy Recommendations

**Policy Recommendation 1: Enhance Access to Safe Drinking Water**

* **Action**: Implement water treatment facilities in underserved areas.
* **Evidence**: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has access to safely managed drinking water [1].
* **Implementation Considerations**: Cost estimates for installing and maintaining these facilities range from $50-$100 per household [VERIFY].

**Policy Recommendation 2: Promote Renewable Energy Use**

* **Action**: Establish subsidies or incentives for renewable energy adoption.
* **Evidence**: Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is just 9.2% [5].
* **Implementation Considerations**: Costs of renewable energy systems can be significant; government funding and partnerships with international donors are essential.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these policies requires careful planning to address financial constraints and political resistance. Funding from development banks and grants should be leveraged effectively. Community engagement is critical for successful adoption, ensuring that interventions align with local needs and practices.

### Conclusion

Addressing water security and renewable energy in Sub-Saharan Africa is essential for fostering sustainable development and climate resilience. By adopting these recommendations, governments can significantly improve living conditions and support broader economic growth.

### Background Information

**Environment**

The natural environment refers to all living and non-living things occurring naturally, as well as the physical and biological factors along with their chemical interactions that impact on any organism or a group of organisms (Wikipedia) [6].

**Resilience**

Resilience is the ability of a system, community, or individual to withstand, recover from, or adapt in response to adversity, trauma, tragedy, or significant change (Wikipedia) [7].
