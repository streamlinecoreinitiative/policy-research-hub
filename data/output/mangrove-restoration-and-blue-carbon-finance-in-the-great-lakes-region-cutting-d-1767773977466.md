# Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Great Lakes Region: A Promising Approach to Reducing Disaster Losses

## Executive Summary

This brief presents an integrated approach to addressing water scarcity and promoting climate resilience in lower-income countries, specifically focusing on the Great Lakes region. By combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, this solution aims to provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation while improving soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.

## Introduction

The Great Lakes region faces severe water scarcity due to climate change impacts on agriculture, causing erratic rainfall patterns. This has significant implications for irrigation practices, which are often energy-intensive and costly. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution by providing sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation while improving soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.

### Current Irrigation Practices

Traditional irrigation methods in the Great Lakes region are often energy-intensive and costly, resulting in significant losses due to evaporation and seepage. [Verify] Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy, while canal systems experience losses due to evaporation and seepage.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it an essential component of climate-resilient irrigation systems. Key benefits include:

* Improved soil organic matter
* Increased biodiversity
* Enhanced carbon sequestration

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, with power generation ranging from 10-50 kW per system. [Verify] Energy efficiency is reported to be around 70-80%, but further research is needed to confirm this.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective outcomes, with total project costs ranging from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare. Return on Investment (ROI) is estimated to be 3-5 years, but further research is needed to confirm this.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Key recommendations include:

* Subsidies for Farmers: Incentives provided to encourage adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Grid Integration: Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure Development: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions.
2. Develop a comprehensive policy framework to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. Provide subsidies for farmers to encourage the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The proposed solution offers a promising approach to addressing water scarcity and promoting climate resilience in lower-income countries, specifically focusing on the Great Lakes region. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, this intervention can provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation while improving soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.

### Needed Evidence

1. **Climate Data**: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Ethiopia (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Economic Analysis**: Economic analysis of traditional irrigation costs and micro-hydro systems.
3. **Socioeconomic Studies**: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

### Rationale Summary

The proposed solution integrates agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to address severe water scarcity in the Great Lakes region. The key data points will help validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these solutions, while needed evidence ensures that the proposed interventions are informed by existing research and best practices from similar regions.
