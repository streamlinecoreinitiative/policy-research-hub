**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

This brief focuses on enhancing environmental resilience, particularly water security and clean energy integration, in lower-income countries through biochar-based agroforestry systems. The case study area is Rwanda, where such an approach can significantly boost climate resilience against the backdrop of rural water scarcity and inadequate renewable energy infrastructure. By integrating biochar into agricultural practices and incorporating small-scale renewable energy sources within agroforestry systems, farmers in Rwanda can improve soil fertility, increase crop yields, and diversify income streams. This strategy also supports decentralized energy solutions critical for remote communities.

### Introduction to Climate-Resilient Water Security and Renewable Energy Integration

#### Background on Biochar-Based Agroforestry Systems
Biochar is a highly effective tool for improving soil health through its ability to retain carbon, reduce erosion, and increase crop yields. When integrated into agroforestry systems, it not only enhances agricultural productivity but also promotes biodiversity and supports climate resilience.

#### Case Study: Rwanda’s Rural Water Security and Energy Needs
Rwanda faces significant challenges in providing sustainable water security solutions for rural communities. Existing energy infrastructure is often inadequate, relying heavily on imported fossil fuels and failing to meet the needs of remote areas. This situation exacerbates the vulnerability of these communities to climate-related stressors.

### Climate-Resilient Water Security and Renewable Energy Integration through Biochar-Based Agroforestry Systems

#### Soil Fertility Improvement
Biochar application has been shown to significantly improve soil fertility, leading to increased crop yields. In Rwanda’s agricultural context, this could translate into higher food security for rural communities.

#### Diversified Income Generation through Agroforestry
Agroforestry systems offer a promising approach to diversified income generation in rural areas. By integrating trees into farming practices, farmers can increase their revenue streams and reduce reliance on single crops or sources of income.

### Renewable Energy Integration

#### Small-Scale Renewable Energy Sources
The integration of small-scale renewable energy sources like biogas and solar power within agroforestry systems is crucial for providing decentralized energy solutions. This approach not only reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels but also mitigates greenhouse gas emissions associated with traditional energy production.

### Empirical Evidence Required

#### Soil Quality Improvements
Data on soil quality improvements using biochar in Rwanda’s agricultural context is essential for understanding the effectiveness of this strategy. This includes detailed long-term soil health data post-biochar application in various Rwandan landscapes.

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
A cost-benefit analysis comparing traditional farming methods with biochar-based agroforestry systems is necessary to inform policy and investment decisions.

### Policy Recommendations for Scaling Up

1.  **Promote Biochar-Based Agroforestry Systems:** Encourage the adoption of biochar-based agroforestry systems through incentives, subsidies, or tax breaks.
2.  **Support Small-Scale Renewable Energy Projects:** Facilitate the integration of small-scale renewable energy sources like biogas and solar power within agroforestry systems to provide decentralized energy solutions.
3.  **Capacity Building and Training:** Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders on biochar application and agroforestry practices.

### Closing Outlook

Enhancing environmental resilience through climate-resilient water security and renewable energy integration is crucial for protecting livelihoods under climate stress in lower-income countries. Biochar-based agroforestry systems offer a promising approach to achieving this goal. By scaling up the adoption of these systems, Rwanda can significantly boost its resilience against climate change, ensuring sustainable agriculture practices, decentralized energy solutions, and improved livelihoods for rural communities.

### Data Gaps

- Detailed long-term soil health data post-biochar application in various Rwandan landscapes.
- Socioeconomic impacts on farmers who adopt biochar-based agroforestry systems (e.g., income, employment).
- Specific examples of government incentives or subsidies available for these projects.
