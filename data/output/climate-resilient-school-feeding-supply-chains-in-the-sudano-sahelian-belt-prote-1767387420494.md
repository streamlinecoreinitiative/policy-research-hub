# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and erratic rainfall patterns. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in school feeding supply chains, highlighting their potential to protect livelihoods under climate stress.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture**

Climate change has significantly impacted agricultural productivity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and increased temperature variability. [Verify] Average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm, with precipitation variability between 600-1400 mm (1). Existing irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, resulting in significant water losses through evaporation and seepage.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Key benefits of agroforestry include:

* Soil organic matter increases (4)
* Biodiversity increase: [verify] native species
* Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, generating power with an efficiency of 70-80% (7). Compared to traditional irrigation methods, micro-hydro systems offer significant cost savings.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective solutions for climate-resilient water supply. Key data points include:

* Total project cost per hectare: [verify] $10,000-$25,000 (8)
* Return on Investment (ROI): [verify] years

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, policy measures can be implemented:

* Subsidies for farmers: Incentives provided to encourage adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Grid integration: Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure development: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Conduct local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop a detailed economic analysis of the proposed solution, including cost estimates and financial viability assessments.
3. Establish partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to support the implementation of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in school feeding supply chains offers a promising solution for addressing water scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By combining sustainable agriculture practices with renewable energy generation, this approach can protect livelihoods under climate stress while promoting environmental sustainability.
