# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Caribbean SIDS: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant challenges in ensuring food security, particularly during droughts. The transition to clean cooking practices is crucial for peri-urban households, which are often vulnerable to water scarcity and energy poverty.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Caribbean SIDS

The Caribbean SIDS are highly susceptible to droughts due to their geographical location and climate characteristics. Climate change exacerbates these conditions, leading to severe water scarcity and impacting agriculture, which is a critical sector for food security. Existing irrigation systems often suffer from inefficiency.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, peri-urban households can access clean energy while reducing their reliance on diesel generators.

## Case Studies and Pilot Projects

Several pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro in climate-resilient water supply systems. For example:

*   **Case Study 1:** In Mexico's Mesoamerican Highlands, a community-based project integrated agroforestry with micro-hydro to provide clean energy for irrigation.
*   **Case Study 2:** A similar initiative in Jamaica's Blue Mountains saw a decrease in diesel generator usage and an improvement in soil fertility.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, policymakers should:

1.  **Promote policy frameworks** that incentivize sustainable agriculture and renewable energy.
2.  **Invest in capacity building** for farmers and communities to adopt these integrated approaches.
3.  **Encourage research and development** of new technologies and techniques for climate-resilient irrigation.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Develop a comprehensive policy framework to support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  Establish a capacity-building program for farmers and communities to adopt these integrated approaches.
3.  Encourage research and development of new technologies and techniques for climate-resilient irrigation.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices is critical for peri-urban households in the Caribbean SIDS, particularly during droughts. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation, these communities can access reliable energy while reducing their reliance on fossil fuels and improving food security. This approach has the potential to provide economic benefits, improve livelihoods, and enhance resilience to climate change.
