# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Horn of Africa: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and poverty. The school feeding sector plays a critical role in ensuring food security for millions of children, but its supply chains are exposed to climate-related risks. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a climate-resilient solution for irrigation in the Horn of Africa.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Horn of Africa**

The region is characterized by high temperatures, low rainfall, and frequent droughts, making it one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally. Climate change exacerbates these conditions, leading to reduced crop yields, decreased water availability, and increased food insecurity (IPCC, 2019).

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Horn of Africa rely heavily on boreholes and canals, which are often inefficient and prone to water loss. Studies have shown that these systems lose a significant amount of water through evaporation and seepage ([verify] FAO, 2017). Moreover, diesel generators used for irrigation consume significant amounts of fuel, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Climate-Resilient Solution**

Agroforestry offers several benefits for climate resilience. Trees can improve soil health, increase water retention, and reduce erosion (Kumar et al., 2018). Micro-hydro systems provide a reliable source of renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators.

**Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in improving water retention and reducing erosion (e.g., [Case Study 1], [Case Study 2]). These systems can be scaled up to support school feeding supply chains, ensuring a reliable source of clean energy and water for irrigation.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in the Horn of Africa:

* Governments should prioritize climate-resilient agriculture and promote integrated approaches like agroforestry.
* International organizations should provide technical assistance and financing for pilot projects and scaling up initiatives.
* Further research is needed to assess the economic impact, community engagement, and scalability of these systems.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop a national policy framework** supporting climate-resilient agriculture in the Horn of Africa.
2. **Establish a regional knowledge-sharing platform** for best practices on agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
3. **Provide technical assistance and financing** for pilot projects and scaling up initiatives.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies offers a promising solution for climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Horn of Africa. By supporting adaptation targets in NDCs, this approach can contribute to sustainable development and reduce poverty in the region.
