# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Caribbean SIDS: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Caribbean SIDS: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to strengthen water security, energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the region's population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1] and just 53.3% with access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023) [2], addressing these issues is crucial for fostering economic growth, improving health outcomes, and ensuring sustainable development in the region.

**Recommendation:** Invest $[VERIFY] billion in climate-smart irrigation cooperatives over the next five years to enhance food security during droughts, improve water management systems, and promote renewable energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to over 800 million people, with a high population growth rate and limited access to basic services. Inadequate water security and unreliable electricity supply threaten food production, health outcomes, and economic stability in the region. According to UN-Water/WHO (2022) [3], 2.2 billion people globally lack safe drinking water, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for a significant proportion of this number.

## Analysis

### Water Scarcity

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1].
* Freshwater withdrawal accounts for only 9.2% of total resources in the region (World Bank Open Data, 2021) [4].

### Energy Poverty

* Just 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023) [2].
* Renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7% of total final energy consumption in the region (World Bank Open Data, 2020) [5].

### Climate Vulnerability

* Progress towards achieving SDG 6 on water security is far from reaching the global coverage rate of 74% (UN SDG Report, 2023) [6].
* Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, with significant impacts on agriculture and food security.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives:** Allocate $[VERIFY] million over five years to establish climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in drought-prone areas.
2. **Renewable Energy Access:** Increase investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation by 20% annually for the next three years.
3. **Water Security Initiatives:** Invest in desalination plants and improved water distribution networks to increase access to safely managed drinking water by 10% within two years.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs associated with renewable energy projects can be substantial but offset by long-term savings.
* Community engagement is crucial for successful implementation of water security initiatives.
* Climate adaptation measures require sustained policy support and financial resources to overcome initial challenges.

## Conclusion

The urgent need for collaborative efforts among governments, NGOs, and international organizations to accelerate progress on water security, energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot be overstated. By investing in climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, renewable energy, and water security initiatives, we can stabilize food security during droughts and promote sustainable development in the region.

**Recommendation:** Implement a comprehensive national plan with measurable targets and timelines to address these critical issues within the next five years.
