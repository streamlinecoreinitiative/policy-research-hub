# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

**Executive Summary**

This brief highlights key initiatives aimed at enhancing environmental resilience in lower-income countries facing climate-related challenges. Focusing on four distinct regions – the Sudano-Sahelian belt, the Sahel region, Central America's dry corridor, and India's Thar desert – it showcases innovative approaches to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. Micro-insurance schemes, indigenous knowledge integration, nature-based solutions, and climate-smart irrigation practices are presented as effective strategies for building resilience in these regions.

**Section 1: Water Security and Climate Resilience in Drylands**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is characterized by high climate variability, posing significant challenges to water security. Micro-insurance schemes have been identified as a crucial tool for mitigating financial shocks from droughts and water scarcity. Case studies demonstrate that successful implementation of micro-insurance can lead to improved health outcomes during heatwaves.

* **Micro-Insurance Schemes Overview**: Micro-insurance works by providing financial protection against specific risks, such as crop failure or livestock death due to drought.
* **Evidence from Case Studies**: Successful implementations in Burkina Faso and Mali have shown significant reductions in household expenditure on healthcare during drought years.
* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Number of households participating in micro-insurance schemes for water security
	+ Impact on crop yields during drought years
	+ Changes in investment behavior due to insurance coverage

* UNDP (United Nations Development Programme)
* World Bank
* OECD Environment Directorate

Data Gaps:

* Long-term impact studies beyond five years
* Specific cost-benefit analyses for different types of crops and livestock in various regions

**Section 2: Harnessing Indigenous Knowledge for Climate Resilience**

The Sahel region faces severe climate challenges, yet local communities have developed traditional practices that can enhance resilience. Integrating indigenous knowledge into official climate adaptation strategies could significantly improve outcomes.

* **Indigenous Knowledge Systems**: Traditional practices used by local communities for coping with water scarcity, droughts, and other climate-related issues.
* **Case Studies**: Examples where indigenous knowledge has been successfully integrated into official climate adaptation projects or policies.
* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Percentage of community members who have adapted their farming methods based on traditional practices
	+ Reduction in mortality rates due to better food security

Official Sources:

* Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, Mali
* World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF)

Data Gaps:

* Longitudinal studies tracking the evolution of these traditional practices over time
* Comparisons with conventional approaches to assess effectiveness

**Section 3: Nature-Based Solutions for Sustainable Livelihoods**

The Central America dry corridor suffers from frequent droughts and water scarcity, impacting agricultural productivity. Implementing nature-based solutions can help restore degraded landscapes while providing sustainable livelihood opportunities.

* **Nature-Based Solutions**: Practices such as agroforestry, terracing, and water harvesting that have been successful in other regions.
* **Case Studies**: Examples from projects where these solutions were implemented successfully, highlighting outcomes like increased crop yields and improved livelihoods.
* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Percentage increase in crop productivity
	+ Reduction in farmer expenditures on irrigation or fertilizers

Official Sources:

* Central America Dry Corridor Development Program (CADC)
* World Bank

Data Gaps:

* Long-term impact studies evaluating the sustainability of these solutions over years
* Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing nature-based solutions with conventional methods

**Section 4: Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**

The Thar desert region in northern India is under severe water stress, yet there are opportunities to promote climate-smart irrigation practices that can help sustain agriculture and enhance resilience.

* **Climate-Smart Irrigation Practices**: Innovative techniques such as drip irrigation or rainwater harvesting suitable for arid environments.
* **Case Studies**: Examples from successful cooperative models where farmers have adopted these practices, detailing benefits like reduced water usage and improved crop yields.
* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Percentage increase in agricultural productivity
	+ Reduction in water consumption per unit of output

Official Sources:

* Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India
* National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD)

Data Gaps:

* Long-term monitoring data on the environmental impact of these practices
* Cost-benefit analyses comparing climate-smart irrigation with traditional methods

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Integrate micro-insurance schemes into national policies**: Governments should prioritize implementing micro-insurance schemes to protect communities from water scarcity and drought risks.
2. **Support indigenous knowledge integration**: Official adaptation strategies should incorporate local practices that have proven effective in enhancing resilience.
3. **Promote nature-based solutions**: Implementing agroforestry, terracing, and water harvesting can restore degraded landscapes while providing sustainable livelihood opportunities.
4. **Enhance climate-smart irrigation practices**: Governments and international organizations should support the adoption of innovative irrigation techniques suitable for arid environments.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience in lower-income countries requires tailored approaches to address specific regional challenges. By integrating micro-insurance schemes, indigenous knowledge, nature-based solutions, and climate-smart irrigation practices, these regions can build long-term resilience and improve health outcomes during heatwaves. It is essential to fill data gaps through longitudinal studies and cost-benefit analyses to ensure the effectiveness of these interventions.
