# Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Mesoamerican Highlands

## Executive Summary

The Mesoamerican Highlands face severe water scarcity challenges exacerbated by climate change, affecting agriculture and local economies. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems to address these issues through integrated solutions.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mesoamerican Highlands

Climate change has significant impacts on agriculture in the Mesoamerican Highlands, leading to reduced crop yields and increased water scarcity. Resilient irrigation methods are crucial for ensuring economic stability and food security. However, existing irrigation systems suffer from high water loss percentages due to evaporation and seepage.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate that agroforestry can also enhance water retention and reduce erosion. Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution for irrigation efficiency by reducing reliance on diesel generators.

### Benefits of Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems

*   Improved water retention and reduced erosion
*   Enhanced soil health and biodiversity
*   Increased carbon sequestration
*   Reduced reliance on diesel generators
*   Increased energy efficiency

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential for combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to improve water supply resilience. Economic analysis highlights cost-effectiveness and scalability.
