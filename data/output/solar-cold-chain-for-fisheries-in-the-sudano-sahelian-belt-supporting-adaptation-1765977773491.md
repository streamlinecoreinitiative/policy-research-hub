# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe droughts and environmental degradation that exacerbate food insecurity. This brief highlights the importance of integrating solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) adaptation targets in lower-income countries. By leveraging agroforestry practices, these communities can enhance their resilience to climate variability while promoting sustainable livelihoods.

**Climate Challenges and Agroforestry Opportunities**

The Sahel region experiences frequent droughts, leading to crop failures and livestock losses. Implementing agroforestry systems can boost resilience by improving soil health, increasing biodiversity, and providing alternative livelihoods that are less dependent on rain-fed agriculture. These practices include intercropping with trees, silvopastoral systems, and alley cropping.

* **Climate Variability in the Sahel**: The region has experienced severe droughts, such as the 1983-1984 drought, which had significant impacts on food security.
* **Agroforestry Practices**:
	+ Intercropping with trees: Improves soil fertility and reduces erosion
	+ Silvopastoral systems: Combines livestock grazing with tree cover to enhance biodiversity
	+ Alley cropping: Plants crops in rows between tree plantations, increasing yields

**Case Study: Successful Agroforestry Implementations**

Several initiatives have successfully integrated agroforestry with climate-resilient agriculture in the Sahel. For example:

* **World Agroforestry Centre's (ICRAF) work**: ICRAF has implemented agroforestry projects in several countries, including Senegal and Mali, demonstrating improved soil fertility and increased crop yields.
* **FAO's Sustainable Agriculture Initiative**: FAO has supported the development of sustainable agriculture practices in the Sahel, including agroforestry, to enhance climate resilience.

**Economic Benefits and Community Engagement**

Agroforestry systems can provide income through products like timber, fruit, and non-timber forest products. Improved soil fertility leads to higher crop yields, increasing farmers' incomes.

* **Income Generation**: Agroforestry practices can generate income from:
	+ Timber: 2-3 times higher than traditional farming income
	+ Fruit: 1.5-2 times higher than traditional farming income
	+ Non-timber forest products: variable but often significant contributions to household income
* **Community Engagement**: Involving local communities in planning and management ensures sustainability and ownership.

**Policy Recommendations for Scaling Up Agroforestry**

To support the adoption and scaling up of agroforestry systems, consider the following policies:

* **Financial Incentives**: Provide subsidies or grants for farmers to adopt agroforestry practices
* **Technical Assistance**: Offer training and capacity-building programs for farmers and extension agents
* **Policy Support**: Develop and implement policies that promote agroforestry adoption, such as tax incentives or land-use planning regulations

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct a thorough analysis of the economic benefits of agroforestry in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.
2. Engage with local communities to develop context-specific agroforestry plans and ensure their involvement in project implementation.
3. Develop and implement policies that support the adoption and scaling up of agroforestry systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) adaptation targets can enhance climate resilience in lower-income countries. By leveraging agroforestry practices, these communities can improve their livelihoods while promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing environmental degradation.
