**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Practical Steps for Decision-Makers**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing issues of water scarcity, energy deficits, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $50-$100 million per project in clean water supply infrastructure to increase access to safely managed drinking water from 32.4% (World Bank Open Data, 2024) to at least 50%. This initial investment will not only improve public health but also contribute to economic stability and environmental sustainability.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. The region struggles with [VERIFY] access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), while renewable energy consumption remains below 10% of total final energy consumption (World Bank, 2020). Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing variability and intensity of weather patterns, further straining already strained resources.

### Analysis

- **Water Security**: Despite significant progress globally (73.7%, World Bank Open Data, 2024), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with a mere [VERIFY] access to safe drinking water. The lack of adequate sanitation facilities and infrastructure exacerbates the problem.
- **Clean Energy**: Renewable energy consumption in the region is only [VERIFY]% , far below global averages (World Bank Open Data, 2021). This shortfall threatens sustainable development goals and increases reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to carbon emissions and air pollution.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, which disrupt food security and water resources. The region's adaptation efforts are insufficient given its limited financial and human capital.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Supply Infrastructure**: Invest in clean water supply systems including pipelines, wells, and purification facilities. Focus on rural areas where access is most lacking.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration**: Increase the share of renewable energy sources in electricity generation to at least 15% by 2030 through subsidies for solar, wind, and hydro projects.
3. **Climate Resilient Infrastructure**: Develop climate-resilient water management systems such as early warning systems for droughts and floods, and improved irrigation techniques that can withstand changing weather patterns.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Estimation**: Initial investments in water supply infrastructure could range from $50-$100 million per project. Renewable energy projects might cost between [VERIFY] each.
- **Barriers**: Political inertia, limited financial resources, and technical expertise are key obstacles to implementation.

### Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders. By adopting these recommendations, decision-makers can significantly improve the resilience of communities against environmental shocks while fostering sustainable development trajectories.
