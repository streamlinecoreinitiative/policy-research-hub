# Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in Caribbean Small Island Developing States: Enhancing Resilience under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and threatening livelihoods. This brief highlights the importance of flood-resilient transport corridors, focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

## Introduction to Climate-Related Challenges

The Caribbean SIDS are highly susceptible to climate-related hazards, including sea-level rise, increased storm intensity, and altered precipitation patterns (IPCC, 2019). These changes have severe implications for transport corridors, which are often located in low-lying areas or near coastlines. The consequences include:

* Increased flood risk: Rising sea levels and more frequent storms threaten the integrity of transport infrastructure.
* Disrupted supply chains: Climate-related events can damage roads, bridges, and ports, disrupting essential services and trade.
* Loss of livelihoods: Climate change impacts agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.

## Current State of Transport Corridors

Transport corridors in the Caribbean SIDS often lack resilience to climate-related hazards. Many infrastructure projects focus on short-term gains without considering long-term sustainability or climate risks (UNESCAP, 2017). The current state of transport corridors is characterized by:

* Inadequate flood protection: Many roads and bridges are not designed to withstand extreme weather events.
* Limited access to clean energy: Transport corridors often rely on fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

## Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors: A Solution

Integrating flood-resilient design principles into transport corridor development can help protect livelihoods under climate stress. This approach involves:

* Incorporating green infrastructure: Vegetation and wetlands can reduce flood risk, improve water quality, and enhance ecosystem services.
* Promoting clean energy: Renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.

## Recommendations

To support the development of flood-resilient transport corridors in the Caribbean SIDS:

1. **Integrate climate resilience into infrastructure planning**: Ensure that all new or upgraded transport projects incorporate climate resilience features.
2. **Promote green infrastructure and clean energy**: Encourage the use of vegetation, wetlands, and renewable energy sources to reduce flood risk and greenhouse gas emissions.

## Closing Outlook

The Caribbean SIDS face significant challenges in protecting their livelihoods under climate stress. By prioritizing flood-resilient transport corridors, these countries can enhance the resilience of their economies and communities. This brief highlights the importance of integrating water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation measures into transport corridor development.
