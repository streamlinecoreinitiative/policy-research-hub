# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Sahel: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the critical challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend increasing safe drinking water access to [VERIFY] through improved infrastructure and management practices. This can be achieved by implementing cost-effective solutions like solar-powered pumps for irrigation systems (World Bank, 2024). Additionally, investing in small-scale hydroelectric projects and solar power plants can boost renewable energy consumption and reduce reliance on fossil fuels (World Bank, 2020). Finally, developing early warning systems for climate events will enable communities to prepare in advance, reducing disaster losses and improving overall resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally in terms of water security and clean energy access. Only [32.4%] (World Bank, 2024) of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, a stark contrast with global figures. Similarly, electricity access rates are low at [53.3%] (World Bank, 2023), impacting economic productivity and education opportunities. Renewable energy consumption stands at [19.7% globally] (World Bank, 2020) but is insufficient for Sub-Saharan Africa’s needs.

Climate change exacerbates these challenges by causing more frequent extreme weather events, further stressing water resources and increasing the demand for reliable power sources. The region lacks early warning systems to prepare communities for such events, leading to higher vulnerability. These issues underscore the urgency of developing comprehensive strategies that address both short-term needs and long-term resilience.

## Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's limited access to safe drinking water is a major public health concern. Only [32.4%] (World Bank, 2024) of the population has access to safely managed water sources. This disparity leads to higher incidences of diseases related to contaminated water such as cholera and dysentery. Moreover, inadequate sanitation facilities exacerbate these issues, with only [19.6%] (World Bank, 2023) of the population having access to improved sanitation.

Electricity scarcity compounds economic and educational disparities. Only [53.3%] (World Bank, 2023) of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity, limiting productive activities and education opportunities. The majority of households rely on kerosene lamps for lighting, which is expensive and environmentally harmful.

Renewable energy consumption in the region stands at [19.7% globally] (World Bank, 2020). While this represents progress, it falls short of meeting Sub-Saharan Africa’s needs. The continent's high demand for electricity combined with limited access to sustainable power sources underscores the need for additional investment and innovation.

Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods (NOAA climate data). This further strains water resources, making it harder to meet basic needs. Additionally, unreliable energy supply during peak demand periods undermines economic recovery efforts in affected regions.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Safe Drinking Water Access**: Implement cost-effective solutions like solar-powered pumps for irrigation systems to increase access to safe water by up to [30%] (World Bank, 2024) while reducing operational costs and maintenance needs.
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Solutions**: Invest in small-scale hydroelectric projects and solar power plants to boost renewable energy consumption and reduce reliance on fossil fuels (World Bank, 2020).
3. **Develop Early Warning Systems**: Establish early warning systems for climate events such as floods and droughts to enable communities to prepare in advance, reducing disaster losses and improving overall resilience.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Conduct cost-benefit analyses for proposed solutions to ensure financial feasibility and sustainability.
2. **Capacity Building**: Train local technicians and engineers to operate and maintain new water systems and renewable energy infrastructure.
3. **Community Engagement**: Involve community members in decision-making processes regarding water management and energy distribution to build support and foster ownership.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa’s challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation demand immediate attention. By implementing evidence-based solutions like solar-powered pumps for drinking water systems and renewable energy projects, we can significantly improve the quality of life for millions of people. These steps will not only enhance resilience but also contribute to broader development goals.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and international organizations must collaborate to develop and implement comprehensive strategies that address these critical issues. Early action is necessary to mitigate further damage and ensure sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa.
