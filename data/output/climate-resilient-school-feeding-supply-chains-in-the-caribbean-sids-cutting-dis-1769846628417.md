**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Caribbean SIDS: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends that governments, NGOs, and development practitioners prioritize investments in climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS). By doing so, they can reduce disaster losses, improve food security, and enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities. Specifically, we recommend:

* Implementing climate-resilient infrastructure for school kitchens and food storage facilities.
* Integrating climate information and early warning systems into school feeding programs.
* Promoting sustainable agriculture practices and local food sourcing.

## Context & Challenge

The Caribbean SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, including hurricanes, droughts, and floods. These events not only disrupt food supplies but also exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities (World Bank Open Data). According to the World Food Programme (WFP), the region's school feeding programs reach over 2 million children, making them critical for food security and education (WFP).

## Analysis

The Caribbean SIDS face significant challenges in ensuring access to safe water, reliable electricity, and climate resilience. With only [VERIFY] % of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), urgent interventions are needed. Renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7%, underscoring the need for increased investment in clean energy sources (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Implement water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs targeting rural areas where access is most limited. These initiatives can include building new wells and improving existing ones with sustainable management practices.
2. **Strengthen Access to Electricity**: Develop microgrids powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind for rural clinics and schools.
3. **Promote Renewable Energy**: Invest in large-scale hydroelectric projects while also supporting small-scale renewable energy initiatives to diversify the region’s energy mix.

## Implementation Considerations

The successful implementation of these recommendations will require addressing several practical challenges:

* **Funding**: Securing sufficient funding is critical; international development agencies, private sector investments, and domestic budgets must be leveraged.
* **Capacity Building**: Training of local communities and technicians is essential to ensure sustainable maintenance and use of new systems.

## Conclusion

Addressing climate resilience in school feeding supply chains is crucial for reducing disaster losses and improving food security in the Caribbean SIDS. By implementing these recommendations, governments, NGOs, and development practitioners can create a more resilient future for millions of people in the region.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and international partners must collaborate to implement these recommendations. Early action will not only reduce immediate vulnerabilities but also create a more resilient future for millions of people in the Caribbean SIDS.
