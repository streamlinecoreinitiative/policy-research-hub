**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Central America Dry Corridor: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

This brief highlights the importance of addressing drought risk through micro-insurance solutions for smallholder farmers in the Central America dry corridor. Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity, affecting agriculture and food security in this region. The proposed solution integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation methods to reduce water loss and increase energy efficiency.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor**

The Central America dry corridor is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with severe water scarcity affecting agriculture and food security. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have led to droughts, impacting smallholder farmers who rely on rain-fed irrigation systems.

**Section 2: Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can reduce water loss and increase energy efficiency. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in improving water retention and reducing erosion.

**Section 3: Micro-Insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk**

Micro-insurance solutions can provide financial protection to smallholder farmers against drought-related losses. Integrating micro-insurance with agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can reduce farmers' vulnerability to climate-related risks while increasing their resilience and adaptability.

**Section 4: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

The proposed solution aligns with adaptation targets outlined in NDCs, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving climate resilience. By supporting the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems and micro-insurance solutions, countries can accelerate progress toward their NDC goals.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop and implement micro-insurance products tailored to smallholder farmers' needs**
2. **Support the integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems in irrigation management practices**
3. **Strengthen policy frameworks to encourage adoption and scaling up of climate-resilient irrigation solutions**
4. **Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and scalability of these integrated solutions**

**Closing Outlook**

Addressing drought risk through micro-insurance solutions for smallholder farmers in the Central America dry corridor is crucial for ensuring food security and economic stability in this region.

**Rationale Summary**

This brief highlights the importance of addressing drought risk through micro-insurance solutions for smallholder farmers in the Central America dry corridor. The proposed solution integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation methods to reduce water loss and increase energy efficiency, supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.

Changes made:

- Removed speculative claims about high water loss percentages (30% evaporation, 5% seepage) as they lack sources.
- Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
- Preserved the title as it is specific to the topic.
- Tightened language throughout the brief.
