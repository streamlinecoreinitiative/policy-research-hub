# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Sahel: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate-induced vulnerabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend that governments invest in rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) to enhance water security. Specifically, we suggest implementing RWHS in secondary cities across the Sahel region, where access to safely managed drinking water is particularly low ([VERIFY] 32.4% [1]). This intervention can significantly improve health outcomes during heatwaves, which are becoming increasingly frequent and severe due to climate change.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a triple threat of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate-induced vulnerabilities. The region's population has limited access to basic services, with only 32.4% having access to safely managed drinking water [1], compared to the global average of 73.7% [2]. Electricity access is also a significant challenge, with less than half (53.3%) of Sub-Saharan African countries meeting their electricity needs [3], far below the world average ([VERIFY] 91.6%) [4]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.

## Analysis

The data underscores the critical need for sustainable solutions that can be implemented within available resources. Climate adaptation measures must focus on early warning systems and resilient infrastructure. For instance, flood-resilient transport corridors (e.g., roads, bridges) can protect livelihoods and reduce disaster losses during extreme weather events [5]. Additionally, solar-powered irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt could cut disaster losses for vulnerable groups by ensuring water supply stability.

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance water security, governments should:

1. Invest in rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) to provide a reliable source of drinking water in secondary cities across the Sahel region.
2. Promote microgrids for rural clinics to ensure access to electricity and improve health outcomes.
3. Develop climate-resilient school feeding supply chains to reduce food waste and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

For clean energy access, we recommend:

1. Promoting solar cold-chain solutions for fisheries to safeguard freshwater ecosystems from pollution.
2. Implementing renewable energy consumption targets through subsidies or incentives for renewable projects.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these policies will require financial resources, technical expertise, and community buy-in. Governments should collaborate with international partners to secure funding and share best practices. Community engagement is vital to ensure that solutions are both effective and sustainable. Potential challenges include initial investment costs, technological barriers, and resistance from traditional power structures.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted efforts at the national level with support from international partners. By focusing on practical, scalable interventions like RWHS, governments can significantly improve living conditions for millions of people while laying the groundwork for long-term resilience against future environmental stresses.
