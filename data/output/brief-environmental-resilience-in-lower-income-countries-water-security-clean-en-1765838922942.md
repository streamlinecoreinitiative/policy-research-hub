**Executive Summary**

Ensuring environmental resilience is crucial for lower-income countries to achieve sustainable development, public health, and economic growth. This brief highlights key issues related to water security, clean energy access, climate adaptation strategies, infrastructure and governance, financing, and case studies/best practices. It provides an overview of the current state of these areas, identifies data gaps, and offers recommendations for policymakers.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Security**

Ensuring sustainable access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation is vital for public health, economic development, and environmental sustainability. According to UN-Water, approximately [insert percentage] of the global population lacks basic sanitation facilities. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme reports that [insert percentage] of the population has access to improved drinking water sources (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme).

**Section 2: Clean Energy Access**

Lower-income countries need affordable and reliable energy for economic growth while minimizing environmental impacts. The World Bank estimates that [insert percentage] of the population lacks access to electricity. Installed renewable energy capacity per capita is [insert figure], as reported by IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency).

**Section 3: Climate Adaptation Strategies**

Lower-income countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. The World Bank reports that [insert number] people were affected by climate-related disasters in the last decade. A significant portion of GDP is allocated to climate adaptation efforts, with [insert percentage] reported by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC).

**Section 4: Infrastructure and Governance for Environmental Resilience**

Effective governance and robust infrastructure are essential for implementing environmental resilience strategies. Transparency International's Corruption Index scores indicate that [insert country score]. The World Bank reports that [insert proportion of GDP spent on public health, education, and environment].

**Section 5: Financing Environmental Resilience**

Securing adequate funding is critical for implementing environmental resilience projects. Official Development Assistance (ODA) received by the country stands at [insert figure], as reported by the OECD DAC. Domestic public and private investment in environmental sectors amounts to [insert figure], according to the World Bank and IFC.

**Section 6: Case Studies and Best Practices**

Learning from successful initiatives can inform policy development. Examples of successful water security projects include [insert country/project name] (UN-Water, WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme). Successful clean energy transition strategies are reported by IRENA and the World Bank.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  **Invest in Water Security**: Allocate funds for improving sanitation facilities and increasing access to improved drinking water sources.
2.  **Promote Clean Energy Access**: Implement policies supporting renewable energy development, such as tax incentives or feed-in tariffs.
3.  **Enhance Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early warning systems, emergency response plans, and climate-resilient infrastructure.
4.  **Improve Governance and Infrastructure**: Strengthen institutions, enhance transparency, and invest in public health, education, and environmental sectors.
5.  **Secure Financing for Environmental Resilience**: Increase ODA and domestic investment in environmental sectors.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience is critical for lower-income countries to achieve sustainable development. Policymakers must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy access, climate adaptation strategies, infrastructure, and governance. Securing adequate funding through ODA and domestic investment will be essential for implementing these initiatives. By learning from successful case studies and best practices, policymakers can develop effective policies to promote environmental resilience.
