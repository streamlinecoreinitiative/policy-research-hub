**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges in lower-income countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], while renewable energy consumption stands at a mere 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)]. To bridge these gaps, we recommend investing in solar-powered cold-chains for fisheries in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, which can increase resilience finance for communities by providing sustainable livelihoods and improving food security.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)] and electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)], with only 19.7% of its total final energy consumption coming from renewable sources [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)]. These statistics underscore the urgency for policy interventions that improve both environmental sustainability and socio-economic stability.

## Analysis

The limited access to clean water and electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa has profound implications, particularly during climate-induced shocks such as droughts or floods. For instance, a recent report indicates that just 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. Renewable energy consumption remains stagnant at 19.7%, far below international targets set by the SDGs (74%) [Source: UN SDG Report (2023)].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Invest in Solar-Powered Cold-Chains for Fisheries**: Develop and deploy solar-powered cold-chains for fisheries in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta to improve fish storage and transportation, reducing post-harvest losses and increasing income for fishermen.
2. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**: Invest in water supply and sanitation systems to increase the percentage of safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)] by leveraging public-private partnerships (PPP) for sustainable financing.
3. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Increase renewable energy consumption to at least 40% within five years through subsidies, tax incentives, and innovative policy frameworks that incentivize private sector investment in clean energy projects.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a coordinated effort involving government, NGOs, international donors, and private sector entities. Key considerations include:

- **Funding**: Securing funding through grants, concessional loans, and public-private partnerships (PPP) will be crucial for implementing infrastructure projects.
- **Capacity Building**: Training local communities on maintenance and operation of water supply systems and renewable energy technologies is essential to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Conclusion

The challenges faced by lower-income countries in terms of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation demand immediate attention. By investing in solar-powered cold-chains for fisheries and enhancing water infrastructure, we can begin to bridge these gaps and enhance the resilience of communities. The next steps should involve initiating pilot projects, engaging with stakeholders, and scaling up successful initiatives across the region.

**Call to Action**: Develop a roadmap for implementation of these recommendations by coordinating efforts among key stakeholders and securing necessary funding streams. Encourage international collaboration through partnerships that leverage diverse resources and expertise.
