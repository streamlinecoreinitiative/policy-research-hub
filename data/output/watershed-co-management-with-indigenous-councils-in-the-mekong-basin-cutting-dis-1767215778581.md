# Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Mekong Basin: Enhancing Environmental Resilience for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Mekong Basin is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent floods and droughts that affect millions of people living in lower-income countries. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a key strategy to reduce disaster losses and promote environmental resilience.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges

### Water Security

* Climate change is altering rainfall patterns, leading to severe water scarcity in the Mekong Basin [verify].
* Existing irrigation systems are inefficient, resulting in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage.
* Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can improve water retention, reduce erosion, and increase crop yields.

### Clean Energy

* Renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, can provide clean energy access to rural communities.
* Micro-hydro systems can reduce reliance on diesel generators, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
* Agroforestry practices can enhance carbon sequestration, contributing to climate change mitigation.

### Climate Adaptation

* Indigenous councils play a crucial role in watershed co-management, ensuring community-led decision-making and adaptive management practices.
* Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems can improve water security, reduce flood risks, and increase crop resilience to droughts.
* Climate-resilient irrigation methods are essential for food security and economic stability in vulnerable communities.

## Policy Recommendations

### Support Adoption at Scale

* Governments should provide subsidies, low-interest loans, and infrastructure development support for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects [verify].
* Community engagement strategies should be developed to promote acceptance and benefits sharing among local stakeholders.

### Suggested Areas for Further Research

* Long-term sustainability assessments of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Economic analysis of cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up
* Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Develop a regional policy framework** to support watershed co-management with indigenous councils.
2. **Establish a knowledge-sharing platform** for communities, researchers, and policymakers to exchange best practices and lessons learned.
3. **Invest in capacity building** for local stakeholders, focusing on climate-resilient irrigation methods and agroforestry-micro-hydro system design.

## Closing Outlook

The Mekong Basin presents significant environmental resilience challenges, but also opportunities for innovative solutions. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into watershed co-management practices with indigenous councils, communities can reduce disaster losses, improve water security, and adapt to climate change. This brief highlights the importance of a holistic approach to environmental resilience in lower-income countries, emphasizing the need for policy support, research, and community engagement.
