**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief emphasizes the need to enhance water security, renewable energy generation, and climate adaptation measures in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite recent improvements, significant disparities persist across the region. To address these challenges, we recommend expanding public infrastructure investments, fostering private sector engagement, and promoting climate-resilient practices.

### Key Recommendations:

*   Expand public infrastructure investments in water and electricity to improve access for rural populations.
*   Foster private sector participation through grants, tax incentives, or PPPs to support clean cooking stoves and safe water access.
*   Promote climate-resilient agriculture practices by providing training on drought-resistant crop varieties and soil conservation techniques.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces critical challenges related to access to safe drinking water, electricity, and climate resilience. According to the World Bank (2024), only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of 73.7%. Additionally, only 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity, significantly lower than the world average of 91.6%.

## Analysis

The lack of adequate water security and clean energy resources in Sub-Saharan Africa not only impacts human health and economic productivity but also exacerbates socio-economic inequalities. For instance, the World Health Organization (2022) estimates that at least 1 billion people worldwide rely on contaminated sources for drinking water, leading to preventable diseases such as cholera and typhoid.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we propose the following policy recommendations:

### Expand Public Infrastructure Investments

Governments should prioritize investments in water infrastructure such as boreholes, dams, and desalination plants to improve access to safe drinking water. For electricity, a focus on decentralized renewable energy systems like solar panels and mini-grids can reduce costs and increase reliability for rural populations.

### Foster Private Sector Engagement

Encourage private sector participation through grants, tax incentives, or public-private partnerships (PPP) to support the installation of clean cooking stoves and access to safe water. PPP models have shown success in other regions, demonstrating that cost-sharing mechanisms can accelerate sustainable solutions.

### Promote Climate Resilience Practices

Integrate climate-resilient agriculture practices into farming communities by providing training on drought-resistant crop varieties, soil conservation techniques, and irrigation systems. Collaborate with local indigenous councils to develop culturally appropriate adaptation strategies that leverage natural resources effectively.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require overcoming several barriers:

*   **Funding Constraints**: Securing adequate funding from international development partners remains a challenge. Innovative financing mechanisms such as climate bonds or blended finance could help bridge the gap.
*   **Political Will and Leadership**: Strong political commitment is crucial for scaling up successful interventions. Establish clear policy frameworks that prioritize water security, renewable energy, and climate adaptation at national levels.
*   **Capacity Building**: Strengthening local governance structures through capacity building programs can enhance effectiveness in implementing resilience measures. Training programs should focus on skills development in areas like hydrology, renewable energy engineering, and climate modeling.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation require urgent attention from policymakers, practitioners, and the international community. By adopting evidence-based interventions supported by robust implementation strategies, these countries can build a more resilient future for their populations while contributing to global sustainability goals.
