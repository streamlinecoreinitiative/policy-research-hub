**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Lower Mekong Delta: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To mitigate disaster losses and enhance resilience among peri-urban households in the Lower Mekong delta, we recommend prioritizing a clean cooking transition. This involves promoting the adoption of efficient and cleaner cooking technologies, such as biogas or solar cookers, to reduce reliance on traditional biomass fuels. By doing so, households can decrease their exposure to indoor air pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lower their vulnerability to climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions in Southeast Asia to climate change impacts [1]. The region's peri-urban areas are particularly susceptible to disaster losses due to their proximity to urban centers, which can exacerbate flood risks and other climate-related hazards. According to recent data from the World Bank, only 22% of households in Cambodia have access to modern energy for cooking, while in Vietnam this figure stands at 25% [2]. The reliance on traditional biomass fuels not only contributes to indoor air pollution but also increases greenhouse gas emissions.

## Analysis

The clean cooking transition is crucial for addressing these challenges. By adopting cleaner and more efficient cooking technologies, households can reduce their exposure to indoor air pollution, which is responsible for an estimated 3.8 million premature deaths worldwide each year [3]. Furthermore, the use of biogas or solar cookers can decrease greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70% compared to traditional biomass fuels [4]. In addition, promoting energy-efficient cooking technologies can help reduce disaster losses by decreasing the demand on fuelwood and other biomass resources.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Promote Clean Cooking Technologies**: Encourage the adoption of efficient and cleaner cooking technologies, such as biogas or solar cookers, through subsidies, tax incentives, and awareness-raising campaigns.
2. **Develop Community-Based Initiatives**: Establish community-based programs to promote clean cooking practices, provide training on efficient fuel use, and support the development of local energy infrastructure.
3. **Enhance Energy Access**: Invest in modern energy infrastructure, such as solar home systems or mini-grids, to increase access to reliable and sustainable energy sources for cooking.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require a coordinated effort from government agencies, NGOs, and private sector actors. Funding mechanisms, such as the Green Climate Fund or national climate funds, can be leveraged to support clean cooking initiatives [5]. Additionally, partnerships with local communities and households are essential for ensuring that energy solutions meet their needs and preferences.

## Conclusion

The transition to cleaner and more efficient cooking technologies is critical for reducing disaster losses and enhancing resilience among peri-urban households in the Lower Mekong delta. By prioritizing this transition, governments can help mitigate climate-related hazards, improve public health, and promote sustainable development.
