**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Andean Highlands: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to strengthen water security, renewable energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. The region faces severe water scarcity and energy poverty, with climate change exacerbating these challenges. To address this, we recommend investing in desalination plants for coastal regions, increasing investment in renewable energy projects, and implementing early warning systems for climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most water-stressed regions globally. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. Renewable energy consumption stands at just 9.2%, with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind at less than 10% [Source: World Bank Open Data (2021)]. Climate change impacts are severe, leading to more frequent and severe droughts and floods.

## Analysis

* **Water Security**: The region faces a critical shortage of freshwater resources; approximately 2.2 billion people lack safe drinking water globally [Source: UN-Water/WHO (2022)].
* **Renewable Energy**: Access to clean energy is limited, with Sub-Saharan Africa only achieving around 10% renewable energy consumption [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)]. This disparity exacerbates the already dire situation.
* **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts are pronounced, including more frequent and intense weather events such as droughts and floods. These events threaten water security and agricultural productivity.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Desalination Capacity**: Invest in desalination plants to provide fresh drinking water for coastal populations where groundwater is scarce or contaminated [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)].
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Projects**: Increase funding for renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines, particularly in regions with suitable climate conditions [Source: World Bank Open Data (2021)].
3. **Strengthen Early Warning Systems**: Establish early warning systems to predict and mitigate the impacts of droughts and floods, thereby reducing loss and damage [Source: UNESCO (2024)].

## Implementation Considerations

* **Cost**: Initial investments in desalination plants and renewable energy projects can be high but pay off through reduced healthcare costs and increased agricultural productivity.
* **Barriers**: Political instability and corruption may hinder project implementation. Collaboration with international partners and development agencies is crucial to overcome these obstacles.

## Conclusion

By addressing water security, renewable energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we can significantly improve the living standards of its population while promoting sustainable development. Immediate action is required to ensure that future generations have a safer and more prosperous environment.
