**Enhancing Climate Resilient Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to enhance climate resilient water security, clean energy access, and adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa. With 32.4% of the population lacking safe drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and 53.3% without electricity access (World Bank Open Data), the region faces significant challenges. To address these issues, we recommend investing in infrastructure projects such as rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants for coastal areas to improve water security.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to nearly half of the world's people lacking safe drinking water (2.2 billion people, UN-Water/WHO) and electricity access (World Bank Open Data). These statistics highlight stark disparities compared to global averages where 73.7% of the world has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and 91.6% has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates these challenges, with frequent droughts affecting freshwater availability and extreme weather events impacting energy infrastructure.

## Analysis

The region's reliance on non-renewable sources for electricity consumption is concerning, as renewable energy accounts for only 19.7% of total final energy consumption globally (World Bank Open Data). This low percentage underscores the urgent need to diversify energy sources and promote sustainable practices. Additionally, climate-induced water scarcity threatens agricultural productivity, leading to food insecurity in regions where agriculture is a primary livelihood.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in infrastructure projects**: Governments should invest in rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants for coastal areas to improve water security.
2. **Promote off-grid renewable energy solutions**: Policymakers should prioritize solar home systems and mini-grids to improve access to electricity, particularly in rural areas.
3. **Implement subsidies and incentives**: Governments can provide financial support to households in rural areas to boost uptake of clean energy solutions.
4. **Integrate climate-resilient agricultural practices**: Promote drought-resistant crop varieties and improve irrigation techniques to manage water more efficiently.
5. **Establish community-based early warning systems**: Implement alert systems to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires substantial upfront investment but offers long-term benefits. For example, desalination plants require significant initial capital costs, which could be financed through grants or concessional loans from international organizations like the World Bank (World Bank Open Data). Similarly, solar home systems can be subsidized by government agencies to make them more affordable for low-income households.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa is imperative for sustainable development. By adopting evidence-based policies and investing in resilient infrastructure, governments can improve living standards while aligning with global climate goals. It's time for policymakers to prioritize these critical areas to build a more secure future for their citizens.
