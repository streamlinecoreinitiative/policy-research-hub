# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Central America dry corridor: raising resilience finance for communities

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Central America Dry Corridor: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical gaps in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, emphasizing the need for immediate action to address these challenges. Our key finding is that only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), while renewable energy consumption lags at just [VERIFY]%. We recommend focusing on increasing water access through improved infrastructure and promoting renewable energy adoption, particularly in rural areas where access remains lowest.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity with only [32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.H2O.SAFE.ACCS.ZS?view=chart). This is compounded by limited electricity availability, with only 53.3% of the region's population having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), further exacerbating economic and social inequalities. The combined effects of water scarcity and energy unavailability threaten food security and public health across the region.

## Analysis

Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, leading to widespread crop failures and water contamination risks. Current infrastructure is insufficient to meet growing demand for both clean water and reliable electricity, particularly in rural areas where access remains lowest. According to UN-Water/WHO (2022), 2.2 billion people lack safe drinking water globally.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Access**: Invest in pipe-borne water supply systems and sanitation facilities, especially in remote regions. Emphasize community-led initiatives such as rainwater harvesting.
2. **Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the installation of solar panels for off-grid electricity generation. Promote grid-connected wind and hydro projects to diversify power sources and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
3. **Climate Resilience Strategies**: Implement early warning systems, water management plans, and climate-smart agriculture practices to protect against droughts and floods.

## Implementation Considerations

Funding mechanisms such as grants, concessional loans, and innovative financing models will be crucial for implementation. Collaboration between government entities, NGOs, and private sector stakeholders is essential for scaling up these initiatives. Capacity building programs are necessary to train local technicians and community members in sustainable water management practices.

## Conclusion

Addressing the critical gaps in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation requires bold policy interventions now. By prioritizing equitable distribution of resources and leveraging technology, Sub-Saharan Africa can build a more resilient future for its citizens. We urge governments, development partners, and civil society to prioritize these recommendations and work towards a more sustainable and climate-resilient region.
