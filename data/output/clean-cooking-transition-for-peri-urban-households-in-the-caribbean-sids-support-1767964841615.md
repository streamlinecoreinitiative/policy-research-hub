# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Caribbean SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity and climate change. This brief focuses on peri-urban households in these regions, highlighting the need for a clean cooking transition to support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The proposed approach integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation, aiming to ensure sustainable water management and economic development.

## Introduction

The Caribbean SIDS are vulnerable to climate change due to their geographical location. Rising temperatures, sea-level rise, and increased frequency of extreme weather events pose significant threats to the region's ecosystems and human well-being. The peri-urban areas, characterized by rapid urbanization and limited access to basic services, are particularly susceptible to these impacts.

## Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

The NDCs of Caribbean SIDS emphasize the need for climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable water management, and renewable energy adoption. A clean cooking transition is crucial to achieving these targets, as it can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.

### Key Components of a Clean Cooking Transition

1.  **Agroforestry-based Micro-Hydro Systems:** These systems integrate agroforestry practices with micro-hydroelectric power generation, providing a sustainable source of energy for cooking.
2.  **Climate-Resilient Irrigation:** This component focuses on developing climate-resilient irrigation systems that can adapt to changing precipitation patterns and ensure reliable water supply for agriculture.
3.  **Renewable Energy Adoption:** The transition to renewable energy sources is essential for reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.

## Benefits of a Clean Cooking Transition

A clean cooking transition in the Caribbean SIDS can yield numerous benefits, including:

*   Reduced greenhouse gas emissions from cooking
*   Improved air quality and public health
*   Enhanced energy security through renewable energy adoption
*   Increased economic competitiveness through reduced energy costs
*   Climate-resilient infrastructure that can adapt to changing climate conditions

## Actions/Recommendations

To support a clean cooking transition in the Caribbean SIDS, we recommend:

1.  **Developing National Policies and Regulations:** Governments should establish policies and regulations that promote the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems and renewable energy.
2.  **Providing Financial Incentives:** Governments and international organizations can offer financial incentives to encourage households and businesses to transition to clean cooking methods.
3.  **Capacity Building and Training:** Technical assistance and training programs should be implemented to build the capacity of local communities, farmers, and entrepreneurs to design, install, and maintain agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

A clean cooking transition in the Caribbean SIDS is crucial for achieving adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation and renewable energy adoption, we can ensure sustainable water management and economic development. It is essential to develop national policies and regulations, provide financial incentives, and build the capacity of local communities to support this transition.

This brief provides a comprehensive overview of the need for a clean cooking transition in the Caribbean SIDS. We hope that it will serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, practitioners, and stakeholders working towards a more sustainable and climate-resilient future for these regions.
