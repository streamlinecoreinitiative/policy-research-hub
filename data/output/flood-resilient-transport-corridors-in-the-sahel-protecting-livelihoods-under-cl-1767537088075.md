# Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Sahel: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Sahel region is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, including floods and droughts, which have severe impacts on agricultural productivity, food security, and human settlements. Developing flood-resilient transport corridors is crucial for protecting livelihoods in this region.

## Current Water Scarcity and Irrigation Practices

Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, resulting in water scarcity in the Sahel region. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, with borehole pumps consuming [verify] kWh/day and canal systems experiencing losses of up to 35%. The average annual rainfall in this region ranges from 800-1200 mm.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Studies have demonstrated that agroforestry can increase soil organic matter by [verify]% and biodiversity by [verify] native species.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation. These systems have power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system, with energy efficiency rates of [verify]%.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide a cost-effective solution for climate-resilient water supply. A total project cost per hectare is estimated to be $[verify]-$25,000.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Subsidies for farmers, grid integration, and infrastructure development are key recommendations.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1. **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Conduct further research** on the long-term sustainability of these integrated systems.
3. **Establish partnerships** between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector organizations to promote the development of flood-resilient transport corridors.

## Closing Outlook

The Sahel region is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, which have severe impacts on agricultural productivity, food security, and human settlements. The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable and climate-resilient water supply system. It is essential to develop a comprehensive policy framework and conduct further research to promote the adoption of these integrated systems.

### Needed Evidence:

1. **Climate Data**: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Sahel (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Economic Analysis**: Economic analysis of traditional irrigation costs and micro-hydro system costs.
3. **Socioeconomic Studies**: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
