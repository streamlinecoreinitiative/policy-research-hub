# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Great Lakes region: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Great Lakes Region: Enhancing Climate Resilience and Promoting Sustainable Development**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, which exacerbate existing development challenges and disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains can mitigate these impacts by ensuring food security, promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and reducing disaster losses.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Great Lakes Region**

The Great Lakes region experiences erratic rainfall patterns, temperature fluctuations, and increased frequency of extreme weather events, which have severe implications for agriculture. These changes include reduced crop yields, decreased water availability, and increased food insecurity. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable to these impacts.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Climate-Resilient Solution**

Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution to water scarcity in the Great Lakes region. Agroforestry promotes soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, while micro-hydro technology reduces reliance on diesel generators and increases energy efficiency.

**Key Benefits and Recommendations**

*   **Water Security:** Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can reduce water loss through evaporation and seepage.
*   **Renewable Energy:** Micro-hydro technology reduces reliance on diesel generators, promoting the use of renewable energy sources.
*   **Food Security:** Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains can ensure access to nutritious food.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  **Scale up agroforestry-micro-hydro projects**: Support the expansion of pilot projects to larger areas in the Great Lakes region.
2.  **Develop climate-resilient school feeding programs**: Integrate climate-resilient agriculture practices and micro-hydro technology into school feeding supply chains.
3.  **Promote policy support**: Advocate for policies that encourage the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate change poses significant development challenges in the Great Lakes region, particularly for vulnerable populations. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance climate resilience and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

**Needed Evidence Snippets**

1.  **NOAA Climate Dataset:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions of the Great Lakes (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2.  **World Bank Reports:** World Bank reports on renewable energy adoption in countries with similar climatic conditions.
3.  **Local Case Studies and Surveys:** Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

This brief provides a comprehensive overview of the importance of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Great Lakes region, highlighting the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems to mitigate disaster losses for vulnerable groups.
