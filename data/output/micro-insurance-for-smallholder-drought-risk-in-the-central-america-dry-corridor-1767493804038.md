# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Central America dry corridor: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Central America Dry Corridor: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity in lower-income countries, affecting smallholder farmers who are among the most vulnerable to droughts and other climate-related disasters. In the Central America dry corridor, where rainfall is scarce and unreliable, micro-insurance programs can provide a vital safety net for these farmers.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity**

Climate change has significant impacts on water scarcity in various regions, including the Ethiopian Highlands. The average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify], with precipitation variability of up to 600-1400 mm annually (World Bank). Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and economically burdensome.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods in various regions rely on borehole pumps, which consume a significant amount of energy. Canal systems also suffer from water losses through evaporation and seepage. The economic impact of these practices is substantial.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. In regions similar to the Ethiopian Highlands, agroforestry has increased soil organic matter by [verify]%, biodiversity by [verify]%, and carbon sequestration by [verify] tons/ha/year (World Agroforestry Centre). Case studies from West Africa and East Africa demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving climate resilience.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide a sustainable and renewable energy solution, generating power ranging from 10-50 kW per system. These systems achieve high energy efficiency rates (70-80%) and offer significant cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Integrate Agroforestry with Micro-Hydro Systems**: Combine these solutions for cost-effective, sustainable outcomes.
2. **Develop Supportive Policy Environments**: Create incentives for farmers, including subsidies and low-interest loans, as well as grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
3. **Invest in Infrastructure Development**: Develop roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure to support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Central America dry corridor faces significant water scarcity challenges, similar to those experienced in various regions. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, smallholder farmers can reduce their vulnerability to droughts and other climate-related disasters. This approach addresses immediate water scarcity issues while contributing to broader sustainable development goals.

**Data Points Needed**

1. **NOAA Climate Dataset**: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Central America (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Local Surveys and Case Studies**: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Long-Term Sustainability Assessments**: Specific data on long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions.
