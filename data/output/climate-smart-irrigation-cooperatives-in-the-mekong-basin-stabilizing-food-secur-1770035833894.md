# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Mekong Basin: Stabilizing Food Security During Droughts**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With [VERIFY] 32.4% of its population lacking access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) and only [VERIFY] 53.3% with electricity access (World Bank, 2023), the region is highly vulnerable to droughts and climate-related shocks. To mitigate these risks, we recommend implementing cost-effective decentralized water supply systems, promoting renewable energy adoption through subsidies and public-private partnerships, and investing in micro-insurance schemes for smallholder farmers.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental challenges due to its reliance on natural resources such as freshwater for drinking and agriculture. The region's limited access to clean water and electricity exacerbates health issues, hinders economic growth, and increases vulnerability during droughts (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). Climate change is projected to worsen these conditions, with the World Bank estimating that climate-related shocks will displace [VERIFY] up to 143 million people by 2050 (World Bank, 2021).

## Analysis

Water security in Sub-Saharan Africa is a pressing concern:

* [VERIFY] 70% of the population lacks access to safe drinking water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).
* Current investments in water infrastructure are insufficient to meet needs.
* Renewable energy consumption remains low at [VERIFY] 19.7% globally (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

Clean energy access is also a significant challenge:

* Only [VERIFY] 53.3% of the population has electricity access (World Bank, 2023).
* Limited capacity for climate-resilient projects hinders sustainable development.

Climate adaptation measures are essential to mitigate these risks:

* Limited capacity for climate-resilient projects hinders sustainable development.
* Early warning systems, improved irrigation methods, and sustainable land use practices can help build resilience.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in decentralized water supply systems**: Implement solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds to improve access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024).
2. **Promote renewable energy adoption**: Offer subsidies, public-private partnerships, and community-led initiatives to increase the use of solar and wind power.
3. **Implement micro-insurance schemes for smallholder farmers**: Mitigate drought risks through targeted insurance programs.

## Implementation Considerations

* Pilot projects in rural areas can demonstrate cost-effectiveness and scalability.
* Collaboration with local communities and NGOs is essential to ensure ownership and sustainability of projects.
* Allocate resources towards climate adaptation measures, including early warning systems and sustainable land use practices.

## Conclusion

Addressing the interlinked challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa requires urgent attention. Governments, international organizations, and development partners must prioritize investments in these areas to achieve SDG 6 (Water) by 2030. We recommend establishing a dedicated fund for climate-resilient projects and monitoring progress through regular assessments.
