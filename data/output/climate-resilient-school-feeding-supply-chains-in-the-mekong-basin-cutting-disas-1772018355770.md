**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Mekong Basin: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief argues that enhancing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for Sub-Saharan Africa's resilience. We recommend implementing community-led total sanitation programs to expand safe water access, promoting solar power generation projects to increase renewable energy adoption, and developing early warning systems to mitigate droughts and floods. These interventions can significantly improve the lives of millions living in poverty.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing drought frequency and intensity, leading to reduced agricultural productivity and food insecurity [2]. The region's reliance on finite natural resources like freshwater makes it acutely vulnerable.

## Analysis

The current situation underscores the urgent need for comprehensive policy interventions:

- **Water Security**: Only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan African households have access to electricity [1].
- **Clean Energy Access**: Renewable energy consumption in the region is less than one-tenth that of the world average at 9.2% [1], hindering sustainable development and climate resilience efforts.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Despite progress on SDG 6, significant gaps remain, particularly concerning access to safe water. Climate change impacts are already evident with a global temperature rise of +1.1°C since pre-industrial times [3].

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa:

1. **Expand Access to Safe Water**: Implement community-led total sanitation programs and promote the use of cost-effective, low-maintenance water filtration systems.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage government investment in solar power generation projects and provide subsidies for households and small businesses transitioning to renewable energy sources.
3. **Improve Early Warning Systems**: Develop early warning systems targeting droughts and floods using satellite imagery and ground-based sensors. Ensure timely dissemination of alerts via community radios, mobile apps, and SMS services.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure successful implementation:

- **Funding Mechanisms**: Establish multi-stakeholder funding mechanisms to support project development and maintenance.
- **Capacity Building**: Develop training programs for local communities on water management techniques and renewable energy technologies.
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: Create regulatory frameworks that incentivize clean energy adoption and penalize non-compliance.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address its pressing challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. By implementing the recommended policies and considerations, stakeholders can significantly enhance resilience for vulnerable populations. Continued international support and local engagement are crucial for realizing these outcomes.
