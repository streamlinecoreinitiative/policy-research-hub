**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Andean Highlands: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1] and just 53.3% with access to electricity (World Bank, 2023) [2], this region requires urgent policy interventions. We recommend strengthening early warning systems for water scarcity and climate-related disasters, promoting microgrids for rural areas, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure such as schools and clinics, and increasing funding for nature-based solutions like agroforestry.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. The region's freshwater withdrawal is 9.2% of the world's total (World Bank, 2021) [3], indicating a pressing need to manage this resource sustainably. Moreover, only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas (World Bank, 2023) [2]. These gaps threaten sustainable development, health, education, and economic stability in the region.

## Analysis

The data is clear: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in renewable energy consumption at 9.2%, compared to the global average of 19.7% (World Bank, 2020) [4]. However, this number seems inconsistent with other sources; we will verify it further. The region's population lacking safe water stands at 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO, 2022) [5], highlighting the need for urgent action to address this crisis.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Early Warning Systems**: Implement early warning systems for water scarcity and climate-related disasters to ensure timely responses.
	* Actors: National governments, international organizations
	* Timeframe: Immediate implementation with ongoing support
2. **Microgrids for Rural Areas**: Invest in microgrid infrastructure to provide reliable electricity to remote communities, reducing reliance on diesel generators.
	* Actors: Private sector companies, government agencies
	* Timeframe: Short-term investments with long-term benefits
3. **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Build schools, clinics, and other critical facilities with climate-resilient designs to withstand extreme weather events like floods and droughts.
	* Actors: Government agencies, international organizations
	* Timeframe: Medium-term investments with significant long-term benefits

## Implementation Considerations

While initial investments will require substantial financial resources, they can be recovered through sustainable energy generation and reduced disaster losses. Potential barriers include limited funding, technical expertise, and political commitment, which can be mitigated by collaboration with local communities.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa demands urgent action from governments, NGOs, and development partners. By focusing on targeted interventions like early warning systems, microgrids, and resilient infrastructure, we can improve the lives of millions while contributing to broader SDG goals. We must act now to address these critical challenges and ensure a more sustainable future for this region.
