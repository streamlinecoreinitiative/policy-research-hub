# Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% of the population) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and electricity (53.3%), exacerbating climate change impacts such as droughts and floods. To address these pressing issues, we recommend investing $50 million to $100 million per project in clean energy infrastructure and water security measures to bolster resilience against climate stressors.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts [Source: World Bank, 2024]. Despite progress in renewable energy consumption worldwide (19.7% of final energy consumption derived from renewable sources globally) [Source: World Bank, 2020], Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data] and 53.3% electricity access [Source: World Bank Open Data]. These figures underscore the urgent need for comprehensive policy solutions to enhance environmental resilience.

### Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and electricity (53.3%) [Source: World Bank Open Data] is a critical vulnerability exacerbated by climate change. With only 19.7% of final energy consumption derived from renewable sources globally, Sub-Saharan African countries are underperforming in meeting their SDG 6 targets for safely managed water [Source: UN SDG Report, 2023]. The region's water stress levels [Source: World Bank, 2024] and electricity access gaps highlight the need for immediate intervention.

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy**: Sub-Saharan Africa should prioritize investments in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems for off-grid communities. This can be facilitated through grants or concessional loans from international development partners.
2. **Enhance Water Security**: Focus on expanding access to safe drinking water through improved infrastructure, such as boreholes and rainwater harvesting systems. Collaborations with local NGOs and community organizations can facilitate these initiatives efficiently.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a coordinated approach involving national governments, international donors, and civil society partners. Funding mechanisms like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) or Green Climate Fund (GCF) should be leveraged for financing clean energy projects. Estimated costs range from $50 million to $100 million per project depending on scale and technology used.

### Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires immediate action to ensure environmental resilience. By investing in renewable energy and enhancing water security measures, the region can mitigate climate change impacts and improve living standards for its population. We urge governments to initiate comprehensive policy dialogues with international partners to secure funding and partnerships necessary for implementing these recommendations.
