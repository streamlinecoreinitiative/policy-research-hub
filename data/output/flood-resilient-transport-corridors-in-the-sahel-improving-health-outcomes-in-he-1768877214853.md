# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Sahel: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy, Resilient Water Security and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), developing sustainable energy solutions and improving water security is crucial for building resilient communities. This policy brief recommends investing in solar-powered clean cooking solutions to improve health outcomes and reduce deforestation. We also emphasize the importance of enhancing access to renewable energy sources and implementing water conservation and purification technologies.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world average (73.7%) in accessing safely managed drinking water, posing significant health risks and economic challenges (World Bank Open Data, 2024). The region faces a severe energy access crisis, with only [VERIFY] % of the population having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023), limiting opportunities for sustainable development and exacerbating poverty.

## Analysis

In Sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 2.2 billion people lack safe water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), leading to increased incidence of waterborne diseases and economic strain. The energy dependency concerns in remote areas hinder socio-economic development and increase reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Promote Clean Cooking Solutions**:
	* Action: Integrate solar-powered clean cooking solutions into national health programs.
	* Evidence: Solar cookers can reduce indoor air pollution by 60-90% (WHO, 2018), improving respiratory health and reducing household energy costs.
	* Implementation Considerations: Pilot projects in rural areas to gauge effectiveness; provide subsidies for low-income households.

2. **Expand Renewable Energy Access**:
	* Action: Increase investment in solar power plants and microgrids to improve electricity access.
	* Evidence: Solar energy can reduce deforestation by [VERIFY] % (World Bank, 2021) and is a cost-effective solution for remote communities.
	* Implementation Considerations: Collaborate with private sector partners; integrate renewable energy into national climate action plans.

3. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Action: Implement water purification systems in schools and hospitals to ensure safe drinking water access.
	* Evidence: Improved water quality can reduce child mortality by 20-40% (WHO, 2015).
	* Implementation Considerations: Partner with NGOs for community-led initiatives; integrate water conservation practices into agricultural policies.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in solar cookers cost $10-$30 per unit. Renewable energy projects require significant upfront investment, but long-term savings outweigh costs. Limited awareness, lack of infrastructure, and high initial costs are major barriers to adoption.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and clean energy access is critical for building resilient communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing targeted interventions like solar-powered cooking solutions and expanding renewable energy access, we can reduce health risks, enhance economic opportunities, and combat climate change together.

**Call to Action**: Encourage government officials and development practitioners to prioritize these initiatives within national climate action plans and public-private partnerships.
