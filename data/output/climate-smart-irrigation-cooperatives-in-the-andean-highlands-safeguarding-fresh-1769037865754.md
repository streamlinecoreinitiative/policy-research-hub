# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Andean highlands: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Andean Highlands: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity and energy poverty, coupled with increasing climate variability. To address these challenges, we recommend:

* Increasing investment in renewable energy for grid and off-grid solutions to reach 100% access by 2030.
* Implementing sustainable water management practices, including rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling, to improve water security.
* Strengthening climate adaptation strategies through early warning systems and drought-resistant crops.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change impacts such as erratic rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, and extreme weather events. The region's limited access to clean water sources ([VERIFY] 32.4% [1] have access to safely managed drinking water) and unreliable electricity supply ([VERIFY] 53.3% [2] have access to electricity) exacerbate existing challenges like health issues and economic stagnation.

## Analysis

* **Water Security:** Sub-Saharan Africa lacks sufficient safe drinking water, with [NEEDS SOURCE] percentage of the population not having access to improved water sources. This scarcity contributes to various diseases.
* **Electricity Access:** Despite an overall increase in electricity access worldwide ([3] 91.6% globally), only half of the sub-Saharan African population has access to reliable power supply. Rural areas are particularly underserved.
* **Renewable Energy Consumption:** Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption remains below global averages ([4] 9.2% vs. [5] 19.7%), limiting sustainable development potential.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Investment in Renewable Energy:**
	* Governments and international partners should prioritize investments in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to enhance grid stability and off-grid solutions.
	* Aim for 100% access to electricity by 2030 through a mix of grid and off-grid solutions.
2. **Sustainable Water Management Practices:**
	* Implement rainwater harvesting systems, improve wastewater treatment facilities, and promote water recycling technologies.
	* Community-based initiatives can accelerate these efforts.
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies:**
	* Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods.
	* Support climate-resilient crop varieties and enhance public health infrastructure to mitigate the impact of climate change.

## Implementation Considerations

* **Costs:** Initial investments in renewable energy projects are significant but justified by long-term benefits. Community participation can reduce costs through local labor.
* **Potential Barriers:** Resistance from vested interests, lack of technical expertise, and inadequate policy frameworks need to be addressed through capacity building programs.

## Conclusion

Ensuring accessible clean water, sustainable energy, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is essential for the region's sustainable development. Immediate action is required to overcome current challenges and build robust adaptation strategies.
