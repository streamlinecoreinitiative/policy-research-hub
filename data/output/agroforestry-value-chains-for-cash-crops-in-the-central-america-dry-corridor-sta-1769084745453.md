# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Central America dry corridor: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in agroforestry value chains for cash crops. This approach can stabilize food security during droughts by promoting sustainable land use practices, enhancing water retention, and increasing crop yields.

Specifically, governments should:

* Invest $[VERIFY] per project to establish desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and improved sanitation facilities (World Bank, 2024).
* Expand renewable energy projects such as solar-powered irrigation systems and geothermal power plants to reduce reliance on fossil fuels (World Bank, 2023).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Only [32.4%] of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), while a mere [53.3%] accesses electricity (World Bank, 2023). Climate change intensifies existing vulnerabilities, necessitating immediate policy responses.

## Analysis

The data paints a stark picture:

* Only [73.7%] of the world has access to safely managed drinking water; Sub-Saharan Africa lags at [32.4%] (World Bank, 2024).
* Renewable energy consumption in the region is notably low at [19.7%], far below global averages (World Bank, 2020).
* Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events threaten water resources and energy infrastructure.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Supply through Efficient Infrastructure**: Invest in desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and improved sanitation facilities to boost access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This can be achieved by:
	* Allocating $[VERIFY] per project for infrastructure development.
	* Partnering with international organizations to leverage funding and expertise.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration**: Expand renewable energy projects such as solar-powered irrigation systems and geothermal power plants to reduce reliance on fossil fuels (World Bank, 2023). This can be achieved by:
	* Providing incentives for private sector investment in renewable energy.
	* Developing policies to support the growth of renewable energy markets.
3. **Implement Climate Resilience Measures**: Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods, enhance coastal defenses against sea-level rise, and support climate-resilient agricultural practices.

## Implementation Considerations

While initial investments can range from $[VERIFY] per project (World Bank, 2024), limited funding, technical expertise, and institutional capacity pose significant challenges. To overcome these barriers:

* Mobilize public-private partnerships to leverage funding and expertise.
* Seek international aid and support from development organizations.
* Build local capacity through training programs for government officials and communities.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted policy action. By implementing the recommended policies, governments can significantly improve living standards and foster sustainable economic growth. The time to act is now – we must bridge these critical gaps to ensure a resilient future for the region.
