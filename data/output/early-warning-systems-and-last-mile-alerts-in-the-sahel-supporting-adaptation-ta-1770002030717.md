**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries: A Strategic Path Forward**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring access to safe drinking water (32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacks safely managed drinking water) and reliable electricity (53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacks access to electricity), exacerbating vulnerability to climate change impacts like droughts and floods. To address these issues, governments should prioritize the following actionable steps:

* Implement community-based water management systems to improve water security.
* Increase public-private partnerships for clean energy projects to promote renewable energy sources.
* Integrate climate adaptation measures into national development plans.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries are disproportionately affected by climate change, with limited resources for adaptation and mitigation strategies. Water scarcity and energy insecurity threaten food security and public health, while unreliable power systems hinder economic growth and social development. According to the World Bank data (2024), 73.7% of the global population has access to safely managed drinking water, but only 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa.

* **Key Statistics**:
	+ Access to safely managed drinking water: Sub-Saharan Africa (32.4%), Global (73.7%) [1]
	+ Access to electricity: Sub-Saharan Africa (53.3%), World (91.6%) [2]

## Analysis

The challenges are exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure, insufficient funding for adaptation measures, and limited technological capacity in many lower-income countries. Climate change intensifies these issues through more frequent extreme weather events and shifts in precipitation patterns.

* **Evidence**:
	+ Global population lacking safe water: 2.2 billion people (Source: UN-Water/WHO) [3]
	+ SDG 6 progress for safely managed water: 74% global coverage (Source: UN SDG Report 2023) [4]

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, governments and development partners should prioritize the following actionable steps:

1. **Water Security**: Invest in sustainable water management systems like rainwater harvesting and community-based water projects. Encourage public-private partnerships to finance large-scale infrastructure improvements.
2. **Clean Energy Access**: Promote renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power through subsidies, tax incentives, and grants. Support technology transfer and training programs for local entrepreneurs.
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Integrate climate change adaptation measures into national development plans. Collaborate with international organizations to access funding opportunities and best practices.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning and coordination among various stakeholders. Potential challenges include limited financial resources, technological constraints, and resistance to change from local communities or private sector entities.

* **Practical Steps**:
	+ Establish dedicated water management committees at the community level.
	+ Develop pilot projects to test new technologies and gather feedback.
	+ Leverage existing funding streams such as climate funds, development banks, and multilateral organizations.

## Conclusion

By focusing on enhancing water security, promoting clean energy access, and bolstering climate resilience, lower-income countries can improve their ability to withstand future challenges. This approach not only improves the immediate livelihoods of citizens but also lays a foundation for sustainable long-term development.

* **Call to Action**: Governments should allocate sufficient resources towards these initiatives and engage with multiple stakeholders including NGOs, private sector entities, and international organizations to maximize impact.
* **Next Steps**: Develop detailed implementation plans, secure necessary funding, and monitor progress regularly. Engage in ongoing dialogue with partners to refine strategies as needed.
