# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and poverty. The proposed project aims to transition peri-urban households towards clean cooking practices by integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in the Mesoamerican Highlands. This approach addresses immediate water scarcity issues while contributing to broader sustainable development goals.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mesoamerican Highlands

The Mesoamerican Highlands are a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased evaporation rates have led to significant crop losses and decreased food security. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide sustainable solutions for irrigation.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Mesoamerican Highlands include boreholes and canals. However, these systems suffer from inefficiency, including high water loss percentages that exacerbate water scarcity, impacting agricultural productivity and food security. [Verify] 30% evaporation and 5% seepage rates are reported.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies from the Mesoamerican Highlands demonstrate how agroforestry improves water retention and reduces erosion. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, households can reduce their reliance on diesel generators.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology involves small-scale hydroelectric systems that harness the power of rivers and streams to generate electricity. This approach reduces reliance on fossil fuels, decreases greenhouse gas emissions, and increases energy efficiency.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. Economic analysis highlights the cost-effectiveness of these solutions, with potential for scaling up to address water scarcity issues.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support adoption at scale:

1.  Develop policies promoting renewable energy adoption and sustainable agriculture practices.
2.  Provide financing mechanisms for households to transition towards clean cooking practices.
3.  Conduct further research on the economic impact, community engagement, and scalability of agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** supporting renewable energy adoption and sustainable agriculture practices in the Mesoamerican Highlands.
2.  **Establish financing mechanisms** for households to transition towards clean cooking practices using integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Conduct further research** on the economic impact, community engagement, and scalability of these projects.

## Closing Outlook

The proposed project offers a comprehensive solution to address water scarcity and poverty in peri-urban households of the Central America dry corridor. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation, we can ensure food security, promote renewable energy adoption, and contribute to sustainable development goals.
