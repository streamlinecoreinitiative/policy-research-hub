**Bridging Water Security and Energy Access in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Dual Approach to Climate Resilience**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends a dual approach to address the pressing challenges of water security and energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa. By enhancing existing infrastructure for clean cooking and microgrids, and promoting renewable energy consumption, governments, NGOs, and development practitioners can accelerate progress toward universal water security and clean energy access. Our primary recommendation is to implement solar-powered stoves in peri-urban areas to reduce indoor air pollution and lower household fuel costs.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security and electricity access. According to the World Bank, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This is a stark contrast to the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Moreover, despite global progress, electricity remains out of reach for many Sub-Saharan Africans. In 2023, only 53.3% of households have access to electricity, exacerbating economic disparities and energy poverty (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

## Analysis

Water security is a critical issue in Sub-Saharan Africa, with high rates of water scarcity due to inadequate sanitation facilities and unreliable supply. The region's freshwater withdrawal is heavily concentrated in agriculture, posing significant environmental risks.

### Water Security:

* Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024).
* Freshwater withdrawal is heavily concentrated in agriculture, posing significant environmental risks (World Bank Open Data, 2021).

### Electricity Access:

* Despite global progress, only 53.3% of households have access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023).
* Renewable energy consumption remains low, with a mere [VERIFY] % of the world's energy coming from renewable sources (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Clean Cooking Solutions:** Implement solar-powered stoves in peri-urban areas to reduce indoor air pollution and lower household fuel costs.
	* Data Point: Solar-powered cooking solutions could reach [VERIFY] % of households by 2030, reducing carbon emissions (World Bank).
2. **Promote Microgrids for Rural Clinics:** Deploy microgrid systems in rural clinics to stabilize energy supply during power outages and enhance health outcomes.
	* Data Point: Microgrids can provide reliable electricity to up to [VERIFY] % of households by 2030, reducing grid dependency (World Bank).
3. **Expand Renewable Energy Consumption:** Encourage solar photovoltaic panels in off-grid areas and support community-led renewable energy cooperatives.
	* Data Point: Expanding renewables could increase access to electricity for an additional [VERIFY] million households by 2030, reducing reliance on fossil fuels (International Energy Agency).

## Implementation Considerations

To implement these recommendations effectively, stakeholders must collaborate to ensure sustainable implementation. This includes:

* **Funding Mechanisms:** Utilize public-private partnerships and innovative financing models such as green bonds and carbon credits.
* **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Engage with local communities, NGOs, and the private sector to ensure sustainable implementation.
* **Capacity Building:** Train community members in solar installation and microgrid maintenance.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's dual challenges of water scarcity and energy poverty demand immediate attention. By adopting targeted interventions like solar-powered stoves for clean cooking and microgrids for rural health facilities, the region can bolster resilience against climate change. Stakeholders must collaborate to implement these solutions effectively, ensuring equitable access to essential services.
