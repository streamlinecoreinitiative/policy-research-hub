# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and vulnerable regions to climate change, experiencing frequent flooding, droughts, and water scarcity affecting millions. To support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), this brief proposes integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, with precipitation variability of 600-1400 mm annually. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and inefficient, resulting in significant water losses: [verify] % due to evaporation and [verify] % due to seepage.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation methods rely heavily on borehole pumps (energy consumption not specified) and canal systems with high water loss rates. These practices are economically burdensome, with costs per hectare ranging from $100-$200/year.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

* Soil organic matter: [verify] %
* Biodiversity increase: [verify] %
* Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year
Case studies from similar regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in enhancing climate resilience.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions. Key data points include:

* Power generation: 10-50 kW per system (no source provided)
* Energy efficiency: [verify] %
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers cost-effective, sustainable outcomes. Estimated costs range from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare (no source provided), with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives:

* Incentives for farmers: subsidies, low-interest loans
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development: roads, storage facilities

### Key Data Points Needed:

1. **NOAA Climate Dataset:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade)
2. **Local Surveys and Case Studies:** Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
3. **Long-Term Sustainability Assessments:** Specific data on long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions

### Needed Evidence Snippets:

* World Bank: electricity access (% of population, Sub-Saharan Africa, latest)
* World Bank: renewable energy consumption (% of TFEC, world, latest)

### Rationale Summary:

This proposal integrates agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to address severe water scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. Key data points will validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these solutions, informed by existing research and best practices from similar regions.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1. Develop a comprehensive policy framework supporting climate-smart irrigation cooperatives
2. Establish partnerships with local communities, farmers' organizations, and government agencies to promote integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
3. Conduct thorough assessments of long-term sustainability and community acceptance

### Closing Outlook:

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical region for climate adaptation and resilience building. By supporting the development of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives through integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can enhance food security, improve livelihoods, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this vulnerable region.
