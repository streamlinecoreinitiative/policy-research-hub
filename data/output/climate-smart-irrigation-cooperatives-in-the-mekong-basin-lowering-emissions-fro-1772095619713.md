# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation due to its vast geographic diversity, limited resources, and frequent climatic shocks. To address these issues comprehensively, we recommend investing in renewable energy infrastructure and water security projects that integrate climate adaptation strategies.

* Invest $[VERIFY] billion in solar power systems for off-grid areas by 2025.
* Promote rainwater harvesting, groundwater management, and desalination technologies to improve access to safely managed drinking water.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to clean drinking water and electricity, exacerbated by climate variability. Ensuring sustainable water resources and reliable energy sources is critical for economic growth and social stability in the region. According to World Bank data (2024), only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water compared to 73.7% globally [1]. Furthermore, renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7% globally [2], hindering development.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Despite progress, access to safe drinking water remains a significant challenge, affecting health and economic productivity. Data from the UN SDG Report (2023) shows that 74% global coverage of safely managed water is still unmet in Sub-Saharan Africa [3]. This highlights the need for robust measures to improve access.

### Clean Energy

Low renewable energy consumption hinders development; current levels are inadequate for meeting future demands. According to World Bank Open Data, only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity compared to 91.6% globally [4].

### Climate Adaptation

Frequent droughts and floods threaten water security, necessitating robust adaptation strategies.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy Projects**:
	* Implement solar power systems for off-grid areas by 2025.
	* Support wind and hydroelectric projects in suitable regions.
2. **Enhance Water Security Measures**:
	* Promote rainwater harvesting, groundwater management, and desalination technologies.
	* Strengthen water infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation programs.
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**:
	* Develop early warning systems for extreme weather events.
	* Foster community-based watershed management initiatives.

## Implementation Considerations

Funding: Secure funding through international aid, regional partnerships, and innovative financing mechanisms like green bonds.

Capacity Building: Train local technicians in renewable energy installation and maintenance.

Stakeholder Engagement: Collaborate with governments, NGOs, and communities to ensure project success.

## Conclusion

Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must prioritize water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation initiatives for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By investing in these areas, we can improve livelihoods, reduce poverty, and contribute positively to global sustainability goals.

### Key Data Points to Cite:
