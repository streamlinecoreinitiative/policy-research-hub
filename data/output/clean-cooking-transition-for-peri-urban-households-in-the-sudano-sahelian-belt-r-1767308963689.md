# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt faces significant challenges related to access to clean energy, exacerbating water scarcity and climate-related issues. This brief proposes a comprehensive approach to address these issues through the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation practices in peri-urban households.

## Introduction

### Background on Water Scarcity and Climate Change

Climate change impacts agricultural productivity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and increasing water scarcity. The region's average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify]. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, losing significant amounts of water due to evaporation and seepage.

### Current Irrigation Practices

Traditional irrigation methods in the region consume substantial amounts of energy [verify]. These practices not only exacerbate water scarcity but also contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

*   Soil organic matter increases by 2-8% [verify]
*   Biodiversity increase by 15-30 native species [verify]
*   Carbon sequestration by 3-7 tons/ha/year [verify]

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Key data points include:

*   Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system [verify]
*   Energy efficiency is at 70-80% [verify]
*   Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions for climate-resilient water supply. Key estimates and financial viability analysis include:

*   Total project cost per hectare is $10,000-$25,000 [verify]
*   Return on investment (ROI) is 3-5 years [verify]
*   Long-term sustainability assessments

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems. Specific recommendations include:

*   Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
*   Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
*   Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

## Needed Evidence

To further inform this initiative, the following evidence is required:

1.  **Climate Data**: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.
2.  **Economic Analysis**: Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3.  **Socioeconomic Studies**: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Develop a detailed project plan, including cost estimates and financial viability analysis.
2.  Establish partnerships with local communities, farmers' organizations, and government agencies to promote the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
3.  Conduct socioeconomic studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The proposed initiative has the potential to significantly enhance community resilience in the Sudano-Sahelian belt by addressing water scarcity, climate-related challenges, and energy access issues. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, this project can promote sustainable agriculture, renewable energy adoption, and economic development while contributing to broader sustainable development goals.
