# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Pacific SIDS: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in Pacific SIDS: Enhancing Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

This brief explores the importance of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Climate change poses significant threats to food security, water availability, and energy access in these regions. By integrating climate-resilient practices into school feeding programs, SIDS can enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement while ensuring sustainable development goals are met.

### Introduction to Water Security Challenges in Pacific SIDS

Climate change affects agriculture, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events. In the Pacific SIDS:

* Average annual rainfall varies significantly across islands, with some regions receiving as little as 800 mm [verify] and others up to 1200 mm.
* Precipitation variability is high, with an annual range of 600-1400 mm in many areas.

Traditional irrigation systems suffer from significant water losses:

* Evaporation: 30% (estimated)
* Seepage: 5% (estimated)

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating poverty among smallholder farmers. Traditional irrigation practices include:

* Borehole pumps: Energy consumption of [verify] kWh/day
* Canal systems: Water loss due to evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%)

Economic impact assessments reveal that traditional irrigation methods incur significant costs for smallholder farmers, with a cost per hectare ranging from $100-$200/year.

### Climate Adaptation through Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it more resilient to climate change impacts. Benefits of agroforestry include:

* Soil organic matter: 2-8% (estimated)
* Biodiversity: Increase in native species (no specific percentage mentioned)
* Carbon sequestration: 3-7 tons/ha/year (estimated)

Case studies from other regions demonstrate the successful implementation of agroforestry systems.

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Key data includes:

* Power generation: 10-50 kW per system
* Energy efficiency: 70-80% (estimated)
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. Estimated costs for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects range from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare.

Return on investment (ROI) is estimated to be 3-5 years, with long-term sustainability assessments indicating the viability of these integrated systems.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions. Recommended policies include:

* Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research should focus on validating long-term impacts and sustainability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Integrate climate-resilient practices into school feeding programs** to enhance food security and water availability in Pacific SIDS.
2.  **Develop and implement policies supporting sustainable irrigation solutions**, such as incentives for farmers and grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Conduct further research on the long-term impacts and sustainability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems** to inform policy decisions.

### Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are crucial for supporting adaptation targets in NDCs under the Paris Agreement. By integrating climate-resilient practices into school feeding programs, Pacific SIDS can enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions while ensuring sustainable development goals are met.
