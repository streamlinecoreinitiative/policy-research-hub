# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, particularly in lower-income countries where climate-resilient agricultural practices are essential for sustainable development. The Lower Mekong delta region is highly vulnerable to climate-related shocks, including droughts and floods, which can impact the availability of nutritious food for school feeding programs.

## Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture and Water Security

Climate change affects agriculture by altering rainfall patterns, leading to increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods. The Lower Mekong delta region experiences significant precipitation variability, with an average annual rainfall range of 800-1200 mm (NOAA climate dataset). Traditional irrigation practices are energy-intensive and costly.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration rates vary depending on the specific agroforestry system implemented. Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, generating power ranging from 10-50 kW per system with an energy efficiency of 70-80%. The cost savings compared to traditional methods are significant.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective solutions for climate-resilient water supply. Total project costs range from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare [verify]. Long-term sustainability assessments are critical to ensure the continued effectiveness of these integrated systems.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains. Subsidies for farmers, grid integration with micro-hydro systems, and infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities) are essential components of a comprehensive policy framework.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Develop and implement policies to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains**.
2.  **Invest in research and development to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these integrated systems**.
3.  **Establish partnerships with local communities, farmers' associations, and private sector entities to promote the adoption of climate-resilient agricultural practices**.

## Closing Outlook

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security in lower-income countries. The Lower Mekong delta region is highly vulnerable to climate-related shocks, which can impact the availability of nutritious food for school feeding programs. By adopting agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, countries in this region can support their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and contribute to global efforts to adapt to climate change.

This brief provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges posed by climate change to agriculture and water security in the Lower Mekong delta region. It highlights the benefits of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation and proposes an integrated approach to enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains. The recommendations outlined in this brief can inform policy decisions and support the adoption of climate-resilient agricultural practices in lower-income countries.
