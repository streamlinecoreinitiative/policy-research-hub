**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Lower Mekong Delta: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta region is highly vulnerable to heatwaves, which pose significant health risks to its population. To mitigate these effects, we recommend implementing cool roof technologies in urban areas. This policy brief outlines a feasible approach for governments and development practitioners to improve health outcomes during heatwaves.

### Key Findings:

* The region has 35% of its population living in urban areas, with limited access to green spaces (World Bank Open Data).
* Urban heat islands can increase temperatures by up to [VERIFY] 5°C compared to surrounding rural areas (IPCC, 2019).
* Heat-related illnesses account for a significant portion of emergency room visits during heatwaves (WHO, 2020).

### Recommendations:

1. **Implement cool roof technologies**: Develop and implement cool roof policies in urban areas, prioritizing public buildings such as schools, hospitals, and government offices.
2. **Establish green spaces**: Create or restore green spaces in urban areas to provide shade and reduce the urban heat island effect.
3. **Develop early warning systems**: Establish a heatwave early warning system to alert residents of impending heatwaves.

## Context & Challenge

The Lower Mekong delta region is highly susceptible to climate change, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns exacerbating existing health risks (World Bank Open Data). The urban population is particularly vulnerable due to limited access to green spaces and increased exposure to heat islands.

### Key Statistics:

* Urban population in the Lower Mekong delta region: 35% (World Bank Open Data)
* Temperature increase in urban areas compared to rural areas: up to [VERIFY] 5°C (IPCC, 2019)

## Analysis

The implementation of cool roof technologies can significantly reduce temperatures and improve health outcomes during heatwaves. However, there are uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness of these measures in the region.

### Key Data Points:

* Number of heat-related illnesses during heatwaves: [NEEDS SOURCE]
* Cost-effectiveness of cool roof technologies: $50-$100 per square meter (World Bank Open Data)

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Develop and implement cool roof policies**: Governments should develop and implement cool roof policies in urban areas, prioritizing public buildings.
2. **Establish green spaces**: Development practitioners should establish or restore green spaces in urban areas to provide shade and reduce the urban heat island effect.
3. **Develop early warning systems**: Governments and development practitioners should establish a heatwave early warning system to alert residents of impending heatwaves.

## Implementation Considerations

* **Funding mechanisms**: Governments can allocate funds for cool roof technologies through public-private partnerships or grants.
* **Technical capacity**: Development practitioners should provide training and technical support for local technicians to install and maintain cool roofs.

## Conclusion

The implementation of cool roof technologies, establishment of green spaces, and development of early warning systems are critical steps in mitigating the effects of heatwaves in the Lower Mekong delta region. We urge governments and development practitioners to prioritize these measures to improve health outcomes during heatwaves.
