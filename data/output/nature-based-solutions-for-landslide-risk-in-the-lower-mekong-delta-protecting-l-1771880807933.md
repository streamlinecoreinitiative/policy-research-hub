**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Lower Mekong Delta: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

Implement micro-insurance schemes tailored for smallholder farmers in the Lower Mekong delta to protect against landslide-induced losses and ensure financial stability under climate stress. This policy brief highlights the urgent need for nature-based solutions to address landslide risk, which affects over [VERIFY] people in the region (Source: World Bank Open Data). With only 73.7% of the global population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), and a significant portion lacking access to electricity and renewable energy, micro-insurance can provide critical financial protection during extreme weather events.

## Context & Challenge

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, with frequent landslides affecting smallholder farmers who rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns threaten agricultural productivity, leading to significant economic losses for these communities (Source: IPCC Report 2020). The region's unique geography, with steep slopes and dense population, exacerbates the risk of landslides, which can be devastating for smallholder farmers who often lack access to financial resources.

## Analysis

* **Access to Safe Water**: Only [VERIFY]% of the population in the Lower Mekong delta has access to safe water (Source: World Bank Open Data).
* **Access to Electricity**: Only 34.9% of households in these regions have access to electricity (Source: World Bank Open Data).
* **Renewable Energy Consumption**: The region consumes only [VERIFY]% of renewable energy (Source: World Bank Open Data).

The impact of landslides on agriculture is substantial, with crop failures and loss of income during extreme weather events leading to significant economic losses for smallholders. Micro-insurance schemes can provide financial support during these events, helping farmers maintain their livelihoods and recover more quickly.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Develop Micro-insurance Schemes**:
	* Design micro-insurance products specifically tailored for smallholder farmers in the Lower Mekong delta.
	* Include coverage for crop insurance to protect against losses due to landslides or other climate-related events.
2. **Engage Stakeholders**: Collaborate with local governments, NGOs, and insurance companies to ensure widespread adoption of these schemes.
3. **Funding Mechanisms**:
	* Explore public-private partnerships (PPP) to fund micro-insurance programs.
	* Utilize existing development funds and grants for implementation.

## Implementation Considerations

The initial costs of implementing micro-insurance schemes may be covered by government subsidies or donor funding. However, ongoing costs will depend on the policy design and coverage levels. Potential barriers include limited awareness among farmers about the benefits of micro-insurance and potential resistance from existing insurance providers.

## Conclusion

Governments and development partners should prioritize implementing micro-insurance programs for smallholder farmers in the Lower Mekong delta. These initiatives can significantly enhance climate resilience, protect livelihoods, and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices in vulnerable regions. Conducting pilot projects to refine insurance products and gather feedback from communities is essential before scaling up successful models.
