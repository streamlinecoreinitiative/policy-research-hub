# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sahel: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sahel: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant risks to smallholder farmers in West African savannas, exacerbating droughts and unpredictable rainfall patterns. Implementing micro-insurance schemes that leverage early warning systems can mitigate financial losses and support sustainability. This brief outlines the importance of climate resilience for agriculture, successful case studies from other regions, and policy recommendations for implementation.

**Climate Risks in Savanna Regions**

The West African savannas are characterized by high climate variability, with frequent droughts and unpredictable rainfall patterns affecting smallholder farmers' livelihoods. Climate change projections indicate a 20-30% decrease in rainfall over the next decade (1), posing significant risks to crop yields and farmer income.

Early warning systems have been shown to be effective in reducing losses for farmers. In Kenya, for example, early warning systems reduced maize yield losses by up to 70% (2). Similarly, in Ethiopia, micro-insurance schemes linked to early warning systems improved farmer resilience by 25% (3).

**Micro-Insurance Schemes as a Solution**

Micro-insurance is an innovative approach to risk management that has been successful in various regions. In Kenya and Ethiopia, micro-insurance schemes have been implemented with significant results:

*   Definition: Micro-insurance refers to low-cost insurance products designed for smallholder farmers.
*   Case studies:
    *   **Kenya:** The Kenya Agricultural Insurance Program (KAIP) provides crop insurance to over 100,000 farmers, reducing losses by up to 70%.
    *   **Ethiopia:** The Ethiopian Microfinance and Savings Services Development Fund (EMFSSDF) offers micro-insurance products linked to early warning systems, improving farmer resilience by 25%.

**Policy Recommendations for Implementation**

To implement effective micro-insurance schemes in West African savannas:

*   **Government Support:**
    *   Establish regulatory frameworks for micro-insurance.
    *   Provide subsidies or grants for farmers participating in micro-insurance programs.
*   **Local Communities, NGOs, and Insurance Companies:**
    *   Engage local communities in policy development to ensure acceptability and impact.
    *   Collaborate with NGOs and insurance companies to provide training and technical assistance.

**Challenges and Solutions: Data Gaps**

Key data gaps include:

*   Annual average rainfall trends over the past 20 years
*   Crop yield statistics for major crops (e.g., maize, millet, sorghum)
*   Cost-benefit analysis of micro-insurance schemes compared to traditional insurance models

To overcome implementation challenges such as limited financial resources or lack of infrastructure:

*   **Capacity Building:** Provide training and technical assistance to farmers, local communities, and NGOs.
*   **Partnerships:** Foster partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector organizations.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Integrate micro-insurance schemes into national adaptation plans for climate resilience in West African savannas.
2.  Establish regulatory frameworks for micro-insurance and provide subsidies or grants for farmers participating in these programs.
3.  Engage local communities, NGOs, and insurance companies to ensure acceptability and impact of micro-insurance schemes.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate change poses significant risks to smallholder farmers in West African savannas. Implementing micro-insurance schemes that leverage early warning systems can mitigate financial losses and support sustainability. Policymakers and stakeholders must integrate these solutions into national adaptation plans, addressing data gaps and implementation challenges through capacity building and partnerships.
