**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Holistic Approach for Sustainable Development**

## Executive Summary

To address the critical challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, we propose a comprehensive strategy that leverages renewable energy to enhance water management systems. Our key recommendation is to **mobilize international funding through public-private partnerships (PPPs) to support the installation of solar-powered water pumps, desalination plants, and other renewable energy-based solutions for water supply**.

This initiative will not only improve access to safe drinking water but also contribute to climate resilience efforts in the region. We estimate that investing in renewable energy infrastructure will yield substantial long-term benefits through improved health outcomes and economic growth.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring sustainable access to safe drinking water and electricity. According to World Bank data, only **32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water** (World Bank Open Data), compared to a global average of 73.7%. Similarly, only **53.3% have access to electricity**, against a world average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data). These figures underscore the urgent need for intervention.

Climate change is exacerbating these challenges by intensifying droughts and altering rainfall patterns. This not only threatens food security but also hinders economic development and social stability. According to NOAA climate data, extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity, posing a significant threat to Sub-Saharan Africa's already vulnerable ecosystems (NOAA Climate Data Online).

## Analysis

The lack of access to safe drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa has severe implications, including increased health risks such as diarrhea (accounting for 20% of all deaths among children under five globally) [NEEDS SOURCE]. Additionally, the region's limited access to electricity hinders economic productivity and exacerbates poverty.

Climate change impacts are also significant. According to World Bank data, freshwater withdrawal accounts for **9.2% of global resources** (World Bank Open Data), highlighting the need for sustainable water management practices. Furthermore, renewable energy consumption has increased globally, reaching **19.7% in 2020**, but remains a challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa [NEEDS SOURCE].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy for Water Supply**: Mobilize international funding through public-private partnerships to support the installation of solar-powered water pumps, desalination plants, and other renewable energy-based solutions for water supply.
2. **Enhance Climate Resilience Through Renewable Energy Integration**: Encourage governments to integrate renewable energy into climate adaptation strategies by providing incentives such as tax breaks or grants for projects that incorporate clean energy technology in water management systems.
3. **Promote PPPs for Clean Energy Access and Water Security**: Establish PPP frameworks focused on clean energy access, particularly solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds, which can significantly improve access to safe drinking water.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in renewable energy infrastructure will be significant but are expected to yield substantial long-term benefits through improved health outcomes and economic growth. Potential barriers include political resistance from governments skeptical of new technologies or unwillingness to commit sufficient resources. Addressing these barriers requires clear communication on the benefits and financial support mechanisms.

## Conclusion

To achieve SDG 6 targets in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is imperative that policy makers prioritize renewable energy investments for water supply and climate adaptation. By fostering public-private partnerships and integrating clean energy solutions into existing infrastructure, we can build a more resilient future where every individual has access to safe drinking water and electricity.
