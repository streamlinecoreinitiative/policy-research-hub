**Flood-Resilient Water Management in the Niger Basin: Supporting Adaptation Targets and Sustainable Development**

**Executive Summary**
To address the pressing issue of flood resilience in the Niger Basin, we recommend implementing comprehensive flood management strategies to safeguard millions of people's livelihoods. This includes developing early warning systems, building flood-resilient infrastructure, and promoting sustainable land use practices. We also suggest enhancing renewable energy use for power generation and promoting climate-resilient agricultural practices.

**Context & Challenge**
The Niger Basin is a critical water resource for millions of people across six countries in West Africa. However, the region faces significant challenges with climate variability and extreme weather events. According to World Bank data, access to safely managed drinking water is low [1]. The Niger Basin experiences frequent flooding, leading to loss of lives, displacement, and destruction of infrastructure. Climate change exacerbates these challenges.

**Analysis**
Studies show that over 50% of households in flood-prone areas lack access to safe drinking water [2]. Additionally, only a quarter of Sub-Saharan African populations have grid electricity (53.3%), with renewable energy consumption at just 19.7% [1]. These figures highlight the urgent need for integrated solutions to ensure reliable access to safe drinking water, energy security, and food production.

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Implement Flood Management Strategies**: Develop early warning systems, build flood-resilient infrastructure, and implement sustainable land use practices. Collaborate with local communities for effective implementation.
2. **Enhance Renewable Energy Use**: Invest in solar and wind energy projects to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, improving access to electricity.
3. **Promote Climate-Resilient Agriculture**: Support agroforestry value chains and climate-smart irrigation cooperatives to enhance food security.

**Implementation Considerations**
Initial investments for infrastructure development could range from $50 million to $100 million [3]. However, this estimate is based on limited data and requires further research. Renewable energy projects may require subsidies or grants. Potential barriers include political opposition, lack of technical expertise, and initial financial constraints.

**Conclusion**
Governments, NGOs, and international partners must collaborate on flood resilience initiatives to safeguard lives and livelihoods in the Niger Basin. Early action is essential for achieving sustainable development goals and ensuring future generations' access to safe water and energy.
