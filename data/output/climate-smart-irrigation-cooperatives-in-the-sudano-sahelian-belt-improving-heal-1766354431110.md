**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Central African Rainforest**

### Executive Summary

The Central African Rainforest faces severe water scarcity due to climate change, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from vast wetlands. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers in vulnerable communities. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change has far-reaching impacts on agriculture in the Central African Rainforest, including erratic rainfall patterns. This has resulted in severe water scarcity, affecting smallholder farmers who rely heavily on traditional irrigation methods. These methods are often energy-intensive and costly, with high water loss through evaporation and seepage.

*   **Impact of climate change:** Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from vast wetlands.
*   **Traditional irrigation methods:** Energy-intensive and costly, with significant water loss.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has numerous benefits for soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate improved water retention and reduced erosion in agroforestry systems.
