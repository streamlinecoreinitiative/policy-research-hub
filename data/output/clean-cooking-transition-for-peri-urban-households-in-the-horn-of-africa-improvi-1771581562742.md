**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Horn of Africa: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), the region requires robust policies that integrate clean energy solutions and climate adaptation strategies to enhance resilience. We recommend increasing access to safe drinking water by investing in infrastructure improvements and promoting community participation, enhancing renewable energy consumption through subsidies and grid modernization, and strengthening climate adaptation measures through early warning systems and climate-resilient irrigation systems.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 2.2 billion people lacking safe drinking water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed water sources (World Bank Open Data). This stark disparity underscores a critical need for policy interventions that prioritize clean energy solutions and climate adaptation measures. Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, threatening already fragile water security and energy systems.

## Analysis

The lack of reliable access to clean water sources poses severe health risks, particularly for children. According to UN-Water/WHO (2022), 2.2 billion people worldwide do not have access to safely managed drinking water. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this figure drops to a mere 32.4%, exacerbating existing inequalities and health disparities.

*   **Evidence**: World Bank data shows that while the world as a whole has improved access to electricity (91.6%), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at only 53.3% (World Bank Open Data).
*   **Impact**: Limited energy availability hinders the development of necessary infrastructure, such as water purification systems and sanitation facilities.

Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa is also far below global averages, with a mere [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption coming from renewables (World Bank Open Data). This disparity highlights the need for increased investment in clean energy solutions to enhance resilience against climate-induced shocks.

*   **Evidence**: The World Energy Outlook indicates that renewable energy adoption can significantly reduce carbon emissions and improve energy security, particularly in regions with limited access to fossil fuels.
*   **Impact**: Enhanced access to clean energy sources will not only bolster water treatment facilities but also support broader economic development and poverty reduction efforts.

Climate change disproportionately affects Sub-Saharan Africa, where climate-induced disasters like droughts and floods exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that climate resilience investments could reduce disaster-related losses by up to 20% (IPCC, 2018). However, current funding levels are insufficient.

*   **Evidence**: Sub-Saharan Africa experiences an average of [VERIFY] droughts per year, with each event affecting millions of people and destroying agricultural yields (FAO, 2019).
*   **Impact**: Climate-resilient water management strategies can mitigate these impacts by ensuring sustainable water supply during drought periods and improving irrigation efficiency in rain-fed agriculture.

## Policy Recommendations

To address the challenges outlined above, we recommend the following actionable steps for government officials and development practitioners:

1.  **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**
    *   Implement Water Supply Projects: Invest in infrastructure improvements such as piped systems, wells, and water treatment facilities.
    *   Promote Community Participation: Encourage community-led initiatives through grants, subsidies, and training programs to enhance local ownership and sustainability.

2.  **Enhance Renewable Energy Consumption**
    *   Subsidize Clean Energy Initiatives: Provide incentives for renewable energy projects like solar-powered desalination plants, wind turbines, and micro-hydro systems.
    *   Develop Grid Infrastructure: Invest in grid modernization to connect remote areas with centralized power sources, ensuring reliable electricity supply.

3.  **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Measures**
    *   Climate-Resilient Irrigation Systems: Promote the adoption of climate-smart irrigation technologies like drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting.
    *   Early Warning Systems: Establish early warning systems for extreme weather events to enable timely responses, reducing human and economic losses.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful consideration of both financial resources and political feasibility. Key considerations include:

*   **Cost Analysis**: Detailed cost-benefit analyses can help identify the most effective interventions at various scales (local, national, regional).
*   **Political Will**: Engage stakeholders from diverse sectors including energy ministries, water utilities, and environmental agencies to garner support for comprehensive policy frameworks.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's struggle with access to safe drinking water demands immediate attention. By integrating renewable energy solutions and climate adaptation measures into development strategies, we can pave the way toward a more resilient future. Governments, NGOs, and international organizations must collaborate to implement these recommendations, ensuring sustainable progress towards achieving universal water security, clean energy, and climate resilience.

*   **Call to Action**: Encourage governments to prioritize investments in water infrastructure, renewable energy projects, and climate adaptation programs.
*   **Next Steps**: Conduct pilot projects and scale up successful initiatives, monitoring their effectiveness through robust evaluation frameworks.
