**Enhancing Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and adapting to climate change impacts. To address these challenges, governments should prioritize investments in water security and clean energy adoption through targeted policy interventions.

## Context & Challenge

Water scarcity is a pervasive issue in lower-income countries, with only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. In contrast, the world average stands at 73.7% [1]. Similarly, electricity access remains unevenly distributed; while 91.6% of the global population has access to electricity [2], this figure drops to 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa [2]. These disparities highlight the urgent need for policy and investment strategies that prioritize water security and clean energy adoption.

Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, further straining existing infrastructure and resources. Without immediate action, these countries will continue to struggle with inadequate water supply and unreliable electricity supplies, compromising their economic stability and public health outcomes.

## Analysis

The current state of water security in lower-income countries is dire. Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], lagging behind the global average of 73.7% [1]. This stark contrast emphasizes the need for targeted interventions that address specific bottlenecks such as inadequate sanitation facilities and limited funding for water infrastructure projects.

Electricity access also varies significantly; while 91.6% of the world population has access to electricity [2], this figure drops to 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa [2]. The disparity is attributed partly to insufficient investment in renewable energy sources and inefficient distribution networks. For instance, the global share of renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7%, compared to only [VERIFY] 24.6% in Sub-Saharan Africa [1].

Climate change further compounds these challenges by increasing variability and intensity of weather patterns. Rising temperatures lead to more frequent droughts and heatwaves, while increased rainfall intensifies flooding events. Such changes not only affect agricultural productivity but also disrupt water supply systems and energy production capacities.

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries, governments should prioritize investments in water security and clean energy adoption through targeted policy interventions:

1. **Enhance Water Supply Infrastructure**: Invest in building or upgrading existing water supply systems to ensure safe drinking water access for all populations. This includes expanding piped water connections, improving sanitation facilities, and implementing cost-effective technologies such as rainwater harvesting systems.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the use of renewable energy sources like solar power, wind, and hydropower through subsidies, tax incentives, and feed-in tariffs. Develop supportive regulatory frameworks that facilitate the integration of renewables into national grids, particularly in rural areas where grid access is limited.
3. **Implement Climate-Resilient Adaptation Measures**: Invest in climate-smart agriculture practices to mitigate impacts of droughts and floods. Promote early warning systems for extreme weather events, enhance water storage facilities, and improve irrigation technologies that are resistant to changing climatic conditions.
4. **Strengthen Public Health Systems**: Integrate climate resilience into public health strategies by investing in healthcare infrastructure resilient to heatwaves and other climate-related health risks. Develop contingency plans for disease outbreaks linked to environmental changes such as vector-borne diseases.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing the recommended policy interventions requires careful planning and coordination. Cost considerations should be factored into budget allocations for infrastructure projects, while engaging local communities in decision-making processes to ensure sustainability and acceptance of new technologies. Regulatory frameworks must be robust enough to support renewable energy deployment without stifling innovation or investment.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries urgently need targeted interventions to enhance water security, promote clean energy adoption, and strengthen climate resilience. By prioritizing investments in infrastructure, promoting sustainable practices, and fostering community engagement, these nations can build a more resilient future. Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must collaborate to develop and implement effective policies that address the unique challenges faced by lower-income countries.
