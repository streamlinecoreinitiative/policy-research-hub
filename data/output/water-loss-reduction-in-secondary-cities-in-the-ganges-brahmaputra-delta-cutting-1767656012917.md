# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Climate Resilience for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent flooding and water scarcity affecting millions of people. This brief highlights the importance of addressing water security in secondary cities within this region, focusing on reducing water loss through efficient irrigation systems and promoting clean energy use.

## Water Security Challenges in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces significant water-related challenges due to climate change, including:

* **Erratic rainfall patterns**: Changes in precipitation patterns lead to droughts and floods, affecting agriculture and urban water supply.
* **Water scarcity**: Increasing demand for water from growing populations and industries exacerbates existing shortages.
* **Flooding**: Frequent flooding damages infrastructure, displaces communities, and disrupts economic activities.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address water security challenges in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. These integrated systems:

* **Improve soil health**: Agroforestry practices enhance soil fertility, reducing erosion and increasing water retention.
* **Increase water efficiency**: Micro-hydro systems reduce evaporation and seepage losses, ensuring more water is available for irrigation.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in secondary cities within the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta:

* **Financial incentives**: Governments should provide subsidies or low-interest loans to communities to invest in these integrated systems.
* **Infrastructure development**: Governments and development partners should invest in upgrading existing infrastructure to support the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of existing irrigation infrastructure in secondary cities within the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
2. Develop a detailed plan for integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into existing infrastructure.
3. Establish partnerships with local communities, governments, and development partners to secure funding and support for implementation.

## Closing Outlook

Addressing water security challenges in secondary cities within the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta requires innovative solutions that balance economic, social, and environmental considerations. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising approach to reduce disaster losses and improve food security for vulnerable communities.
