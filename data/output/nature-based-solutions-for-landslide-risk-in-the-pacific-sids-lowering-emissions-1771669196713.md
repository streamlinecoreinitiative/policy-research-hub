# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Pacific SIDS: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Pacific SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

### Executive Summary

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant challenges in managing landslide risk, which is exacerbated by climate change and lack of access to clean energy and water security. To address this issue comprehensively, we recommend implementing nature-based solutions that integrate with existing infrastructure to reduce emissions from critical sectors. This approach can enhance resilience while promoting sustainable development.

### Context & Challenge

The Pacific SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, including landslides, which have devastating impacts on communities and economies (IPCC, 2021). The region's unique geography and climate make it prone to extreme weather events, further exacerbated by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. According to the World Bank data, only [VERIFY] % of the Pacific SIDS' population has access to safely managed drinking water, while renewable energy consumption stands at a mere [VERIFY] %, compared to the world average of 19.7% (World Bank Open Data).

### Analysis

The lack of access to clean energy and water security in the Pacific SIDS is not only a development challenge but also a climate resilience issue. The region's reliance on fossil fuels contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which exacerbate climate change impacts. In contrast, nature-based solutions that integrate with existing infrastructure can provide multiple benefits, including reducing landslide risk, improving water quality, and promoting renewable energy consumption.

### Policy Recommendations

To enhance environmental resilience in the Pacific SIDS, we recommend:

1.  **Integrate Nature-Based Solutions into Existing Infrastructure**: Incorporate green infrastructure such as wetlands, mangroves, and forests into existing urban planning to reduce landslide risk and improve water quality.
2.  **Promote Renewable Energy Consumption**: Invest in renewable energy projects like solar mini-grids, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power plants to increase access to clean energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
3.  **Enhance Water Security**: Increase investment in infrastructure such as boreholes, pipelines, and community water points to improve access to safely managed drinking water.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a multi-faceted approach that involves:

1.  **Funding**: Secure funding through grants, loans from international organizations like the World Bank or regional development banks.
2.  **Partnerships**: Engage with private sector entities such as NGOs, utilities, and technology firms to accelerate project implementation.
3.  **Policy Support**: Develop supportive policies that incentivize investment in green infrastructure and renewable energy.

### Conclusion

Enhancing environmental resilience in the Pacific SIDS requires a comprehensive approach that integrates nature-based solutions with existing infrastructure to reduce emissions from critical sectors. By implementing these recommendations, we can promote sustainable development while improving climate resilience and reducing landslide risk.
