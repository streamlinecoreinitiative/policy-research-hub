# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Lower Mekong delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

This brief explores the potential of biochar-based agroforestry systems to enhance water security, energy production, and climate resilience in rural Tanzania. By integrating biochar into agricultural practices, farmers can improve soil health, increase water retention, and reduce erosion. Additionally, biochar can be used as a sustainable energy source, generating biomass that can be converted into biogas or electricity. This approach not only supports agricultural productivity but also reduces carbon emissions by sequestering atmospheric CO2. However, there are challenges to adoption, including financial constraints and regulatory hurdles, which require supportive policies for scaling up this approach.

**Introduction to Biochar-Based Agroforestry Systems**

Biochar-based agroforestry systems involve the incorporation of biochar into agricultural soils to enhance fertility, structure, and water-holding capacity. This approach has gained attention in recent years due to its potential benefits for climate resilience in agriculture. In rural Tanzania, where agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and water scarcity is a pressing issue, integrating biochar-based agroforestry systems can be a promising strategy.

**Water Security through Agroforestry**

Biochar-based agroforestry systems improve soil health by increasing the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soils, allowing them to retain more nutrients and water. This leads to increased crop yields and reduced erosion. Key data points needed include:

* Soil moisture content measurements before and after implementation
* Yield data from agricultural plots using biochar-based agroforestry systems compared to traditional methods

**Renewable Energy Integration**

Biochar can be used as a sustainable energy source in rural Tanzania, generating biomass that can be converted into biogas or electricity. This approach has the potential to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower emissions from the agricultural sector.

* Biomass generation potential
* Efficiency rates of biochar-derived biogas or electricity production

**Climate Resilience Benefits**

Biochar-based agroforestry systems contribute to climate adaptation and mitigation in Tanzania's agricultural sector by:

* Improving biodiversity through the incorporation of multiple tree species
* Increasing soil carbon levels, which can sequester atmospheric CO2
* Enhancing ecosystem services crucial for climate resilience

**Challenges and Policy Recommendations**

Despite its potential benefits, there are challenges to adopting biochar-based agroforestry systems in rural Tanzania. These include:

* Financial constraints associated with purchasing and applying biochar
* Regulatory hurdles related to land use and agricultural practices

To overcome these barriers, supportive policies are necessary for scaling up this approach. Key recommendations include:

1. **Subsidies or incentives** for farmers to adopt biochar-based agroforestry systems.
2. **Regulatory frameworks** that support the integration of biochar into agricultural practices.
3. **Capacity building and training programs** for farmers, extension agents, and other stakeholders.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct further research on the long-term yield stability data from different agroforestry systems over multiple seasons.
2. Develop a detailed cost-benefit analysis comparing biochar-based agroforestry to conventional farming methods in terms of economic viability and environmental impact.
3. Engage with policymakers, farmers, and other stakeholders to promote the adoption of biochar-based agroforestry systems.

**Closing Outlook**

Biochar-based agroforestry systems have the potential to enhance water security, energy production, and climate resilience in rural Tanzania. However, there are challenges to adoption that require supportive policies for scaling up this approach. By investing in research, capacity building, and policy development, we can unlock the full potential of biochar-based agroforestry systems and contribute to a more sustainable future for agriculture in Tanzania.
