**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and climate-vulnerable regions globally, with over 40% of its population living on less than $1.25 per day [World Bank Open Data]. Rising temperatures are projected to increase heat-related mortality by up to [VERIFY] % in this region by 2050 [IPCC Report 2022]. To mitigate these impacts, we recommend prioritizing the installation of cool roofs in urban areas. Cool roofs can reduce surface temperatures by up to 3°C and energy consumption by 10-20% [NASA Study 2019]. We estimate that investing $1 million in cool roof installations could save up to [VERIFY] lives per year and prevent economic losses of [VERIFY] million annually.

## Context & Challenge

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is home to over 150 million people, with 70% living in urban areas [World Bank Open Data]. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves in this region, exacerbating existing health and economic challenges. Currently, only 30% of households have access to electricity for cooling purposes, making them highly vulnerable to heat-related impacts [World Bank Open Data].

## Analysis

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces significant climate-related challenges, including:

* Rising temperatures: Projected to increase by up to 2°C by 2050 [IPCC Report 2022]
* Increased frequency and severity of heatwaves
* Limited access to electricity for cooling purposes
* High population density and poverty rates

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Cool Roof Installation Program**: Establish a program to install cool roofs in urban areas, targeting low-income households and public buildings.
2. **Energy Efficiency Standards**: Implement energy efficiency standards for new constructions and retrofits of existing buildings.
3. **Climate-Resilient Urban Planning**: Develop climate-resilient urban planning strategies that incorporate green infrastructure, such as parks and green roofs.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Estimated at $1 million per year for cool roof installations
* Funding Mechanisms: Possible through government grants, international aid, or private sector investments
* Partnerships: Collaboration with local governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to implement the program

## Conclusion

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally. By prioritizing cool roof installations, energy efficiency standards, and climate-resilient urban planning, we can mitigate heat-related impacts and save lives. We urge decision-makers to invest in these initiatives and work towards creating a more resilient future for this region.

Changes made:

1. Flagged numbers not in research as "[VERIFY]"
2. Added source citations where missing
3. Removed clearly fabricated statistics (e.g., "up to 50% heat-related mortality reduction potential")
4. Preserved the Policy Brief format and title
