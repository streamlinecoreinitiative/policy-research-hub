# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, with severe impacts on agriculture and food security. Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems are proposed as a cost-effective solution to address this challenge.

## Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change has significantly impacted rainfall patterns in the Ethiopian Highlands, leading to erratic precipitation and exacerbating water scarcity. The region's average annual rainfall ranges from [verify] mm, with a variability range of [verify] mm. This unpredictability affects agricultural productivity and food security.

### Key Data Points:

* Average annual rainfall: [verify]
* Precipitation Variability Range: [verify]

### Needed Evidence:

Verification of NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Ethiopia, highlighting rainfall patterns over the past decade.

## Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Their Limitations

Traditional irrigation methods in the Horn of Africa are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems experience losses due to evaporation and seepage.

### Key Data Points:

* Borehole pumps: [verify] kWh/day
* Canal Systems Losses: [verify]

### Needed Evidence:

Economic analysis of traditional irrigation costs, highlighting the financial burden on farmers and communities.

## Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Local surveys and case studies indicate that agroforestry can increase soil organic matter by [verify]%, biodiversity by [verify] native species, and carbon sequestration by [verify] tons/ha/year.

### Key Data Points:

* Soil Organic Matter: [verify]% increase
* Biodiversity Increase: [verify] native species
* Carbon Sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

### Needed Evidence:

Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from agroforestry.

## Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, with power generation ranging from [verify] kW per system. Energy efficiency is reported at [verify]%, while cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods are significant.

### Key Data Points:

* Power Generation Range: [verify] kW
* Energy Efficiency: [verify]%
* Cost Savings: Compared to traditional irrigation methods

### Needed Evidence:

Economic analysis of micro-hydro systems, highlighting their potential for long-term sustainability and cost-effectiveness.

## Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated solutions combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective outcomes. The total project cost per hectare is estimated at [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of [verify] years.

### Key Data Points:

* Total Project Cost per Hectare: [verify]
* Return on Investment (ROI): [verify]

### Needed Evidence:

Long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions, highlighting the potential for integrated solutions to address climate change impacts.

## Actions and Recommendations

1. **Policy Support**: Governments in the Horn of Africa should provide incentives for farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Capacity Building**: Training programs should be established to enhance the skills of farmers, technicians, and policymakers in implementing integrated solutions.
3. **Infrastructure Development**: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements are necessary to support the widespread adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems have the potential to address severe water scarcity in the Horn of Africa. By adopting these integrated approaches, countries can reduce energy consumption, enhance climate resilience, and improve food security. It is essential that policymakers and stakeholders prioritize support for these initiatives, ensuring a supportive environment for their implementation and long-term sustainability.
