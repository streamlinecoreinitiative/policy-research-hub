**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: Strategic Priorities for Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, we recommend **accelerating infrastructure development** to build resilient water supply systems and distribution networks. This can be achieved through investments in rainwater harvesting ponds and other innovative solutions that enhance water availability. By prioritizing this critical area, governments and international organizations can help ensure both environmental resilience and socio-economic stability.

## Context & Challenge

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity across Sub-Saharan Africa, where only **[VERIFY] 32.4%** of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This stark disparity underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions. Despite progress towards universal access to safe drinking water globally at **73.7%** (World Bank Open Data), this figure drops significantly in the region. Similarly, while worldwide electricity access stands at **91.6%**, just over half of residents in Sub-Saharan Africa have reliable power (**53.3%**) (World Bank Open Data).

## Analysis

Research indicates that climate change is leading to more frequent and severe droughts, affecting water resources and increasing demand for clean energy solutions. The World Bank reports a **1.1°C** increase in global temperature since pre-industrial times, highlighting the impact on ecosystems and human settlements (IPCC AR6). In Sub-Saharan Africa, these changes have exacerbated water scarcity issues.

Furthermore, inadequate infrastructure exacerbates challenges. Only about one-third of people in this region use safely managed drinking water sources. Similarly, electricity access remains unevenly distributed, with only half of residents benefiting from reliable power. These disparities highlight the critical need for targeted interventions to improve both water security and clean energy access.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, governments and international organizations should implement the following policies:

1. **Accelerate Infrastructure Development**: Invest in building resilient water supply systems and distribution networks.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the use of renewable energy sources such as solar power to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, thereby improving both energy security and environmental sustainability.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Programs**: Develop comprehensive climate adaptation programs that integrate early warning systems and disaster preparedness measures.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning to ensure feasibility:

* Conduct cost-benefit analyses for each policy recommendation to determine their financial viability.
* Involve local communities, civil society organizations, and private sector entities in the development of these programs to foster ownership and sustainability.
* Train and support local authorities and community leaders to ensure effective implementation.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. By adopting targeted policies and practical steps, they can build a more resilient future for their populations. The international community should collaborate closely with these nations to provide the necessary resources and expertise to address these pressing issues effectively.
