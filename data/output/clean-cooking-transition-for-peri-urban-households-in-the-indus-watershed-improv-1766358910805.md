# **Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Indus Watershed: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

The transition to clean cooking practices is crucial for improving health outcomes, particularly during heatwaves, in peri-urban households within the Indus watershed. This brief highlights the importance of addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries.

## **Addressing Water Scarcity and Poverty through Integrated Solutions**

The Indus watershed is characterized by severe water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change impacts on agriculture. Resilient irrigation methods are essential for food security and economic stability. Current irrigation practices in the region include boreholes and canals, which experience significant water loss due to evaporation and seepage \[verify\]. Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while enhancing water retention and reducing erosion.

### Benefits of Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems

*   Reduced reliance on diesel generators
*   Increased energy efficiency
*   Improved water retention and reduced erosion
*   Enhanced economic stability through increased crop yields

## **Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

1.  **Support for Adoption at Scale:** Governments and international organizations should provide financial incentives, technical assistance, and policy support to encourage the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Economic Impact Analysis:** Further research is needed to assess the long-term economic benefits of these integrated solutions, including cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.
3.  **Community Engagement:** Socioeconomic studies should be conducted to understand community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.

## **Closing Outlook**

The transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households within the Indus watershed requires a comprehensive approach addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address severe water scarcity and poverty while ensuring economic benefits and sustainability.
