# Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Central America Dry Corridor: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and droughts that impact agriculture, food security, and economic stability. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in the region. By leveraging renewable energy and promoting sustainable land use practices, integrated solutions can enhance water security, reduce energy costs, and support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This brief provides an overview of current irrigation challenges, the benefits of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, and policy recommendations to support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.

## Water Scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Central America dry corridor through increased evaporation from wetlands, erratic rainfall patterns, and changing temperature regimes. Traditional irrigation methods are often energy-intensive and costly, placing a significant burden on smallholder farmers who already face economic challenges due to droughts. The region's NDCs emphasize the need for climate-resilient agriculture practices that promote water security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

### Key Challenges:

• Erratic rainfall patterns
• Increased evaporation from wetlands
• Changing temperature regimes
• Energy-intensive irrigation methods

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Climate-Resilient Solution

Agroforestry, the integration of trees into agricultural landscapes, offers numerous benefits for soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. When combined with micro-hydro systems, agroforestry can provide a sustainable solution for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

### Benefits:

• Reduced water loss through evaporation
• Improved soil health and fertility
• Enhanced biodiversity
• Carbon sequestration

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Central America dry corridor, policymakers should consider the following recommendations:

1.  **Invest in Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems:** Provide financial and technical assistance to smallholder farmers and agricultural cooperatives to establish agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Promote Climate-Resilient Irrigation Practices:** Encourage the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation methods that reduce water waste and energy consumption.
3.  **Support Community-Based Adaptation Initiatives:** Foster community-led adaptation initiatives that prioritize local knowledge and traditional practices in addressing climate change impacts.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  Conduct socioeconomic studies to assess the benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro solutions for smallholder farmers and communities.
2.  Develop cost-benefit analyses of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems to inform investment decisions.
3.  Establish partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities to support the scaling up of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.

## Closing Outlook

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts on agriculture. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation, smallholder farmers can enhance water security, reduce energy costs, and support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. Policymakers, researchers, and practitioners must work together to promote the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives and ensure a sustainable future for agriculture in the region.
