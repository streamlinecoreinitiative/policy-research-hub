**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the need for a clean cooking transition in peri-urban households of the Central America dry corridor to improve health outcomes during heatwaves. The region's population is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, with 30% of households relying on traditional biomass fuels for cooking (World Bank Open Data). To address this issue, we recommend investing $1 million annually in clean energy initiatives by 2025, focusing on solar-powered cookstoves and biogas systems. This investment will reduce indoor air pollution, improve health outcomes, and mitigate the impacts of heatwaves.

## Context & Challenge

The Central America dry corridor is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally (UN-Water/WHO). The region's population faces significant challenges in accessing clean energy sources for cooking, with 70% of households relying on traditional biomass fuels (World Bank Open Data). This reliance on biomass fuels leads to high levels of indoor air pollution, resulting in an estimated [VERIFY] million premature deaths annually (UN-Water/WHO).

## Analysis

The use of traditional biomass fuels for cooking contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (IPCC AR6). In the Central America dry corridor, temperatures have risen by 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, exacerbating heatwaves and their associated health impacts (World Bank Open Data). To mitigate these effects, a clean cooking transition is essential.

## Policy Recommendations

*   **Invest in Clean Energy Initiatives**: Allocate $1 million annually towards solar-powered cookstoves and biogas systems by 2025.
    *   This investment will reduce indoor air pollution and improve health outcomes for peri-urban households.
*   **Promote Energy Efficiency**: Implement energy-efficient cooking practices and promote the use of clean energy sources in public institutions, such as schools and hospitals.
    *   This approach will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of heatwaves.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementation of these recommendations will require collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and local communities. Key stakeholders include:

*   Government agencies responsible for energy policy and climate change adaptation
*   NGOs working on clean energy initiatives and community development
*   Local communities affected by climate-related disasters

Funding mechanisms may include:

*   International climate finance (UNFCCC)
*   National budget allocations for clean energy initiatives
*   Private sector investments in clean energy projects

## Conclusion

The clean cooking transition is essential for improving health outcomes during heatwaves in the Central America dry corridor. By investing in clean energy initiatives and promoting energy efficiency, we can reduce indoor air pollution, mitigate climate-related disasters, and improve the well-being of peri-urban households.
