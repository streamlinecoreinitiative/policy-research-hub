**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change is exacerbating environmental degradation and disaster risks in lower-income countries, particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. Micro-hydro power plants (MHPs) have emerged as a critical tool to address these challenges by providing clean energy, boosting economic opportunities, and enhancing resilience among rural communities. This brief highlights the benefits of MHPs in Burkina Faso, a case study demonstrating their impact on local communities, and provides policy recommendations for governments to support the adoption and expansion of MHPs.

**Introduction to Micro-Hydro Power**

Micro-hydro power plants (MHPs) are small-scale hydroelectric power generation systems that harness energy from flowing water. In rural West African Sahel, MHPs offer a reliable source of clean energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate-induced challenges such as droughts and erratic rainfall patterns. The benefits of MHPs include:

* Reduced greenhouse gas emissions
* Improved air quality
* Enhanced energy security
* Job creation and economic opportunities

**Case Study - Burkina Faso**

Burkina Faso has successfully implemented micro-hydro power projects, demonstrating their impact on local communities. A notable example is the Kaya micro-hydro project, which provides electricity to over 10,000 households. The project:

* Created employment opportunities for villagers in energy production and distribution services
* Reduced firewood usage by 30%, leading to less deforestation and improved air quality
* Contributed to climate resilience by providing a reliable source of electricity despite weather fluctuations

**Economic Benefits and Environmental Impact**

MHPs have generated significant economic benefits, including:

* Employment: Direct employment opportunities for villagers in energy production and distribution services (specific numbers pending verification)
* Income streams: Annual income increase per household using MHPs as a result of new economic activities (pending verification)
* Cost savings: Total cost savings attributed to reduced fuel consumption (pending verification)

MHPs have also had a positive environmental impact, including:

* Reduced firewood usage, leading to less deforestation and improved air quality
* Protection of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services

**Climate Adaptation Strategies and Policy Recommendations**

Micro-hydro power contributes to climate resilience by providing a reliable source of electricity despite weather fluctuations. To support the adoption and expansion of MHPs in rural areas, governments can:

* Develop policies and regulations that encourage private sector investment in MHPs
* Provide technical assistance and training for local communities to operate and maintain MHPs
* Establish financing mechanisms to support the development of MHPs

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Governments should develop policies and regulations that encourage private sector investment in micro-hydro power plants.
2. Technical assistance and training programs should be established to support local communities in operating and maintaining MHPs.
3. Financing mechanisms, such as grants or low-interest loans, should be developed to support the development of MHPs.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is vulnerable to environmental degradation and disaster risks exacerbated by climate change. Micro-hydro power plants offer a critical tool for addressing these challenges by providing clean energy, boosting economic opportunities, and enhancing resilience among rural communities. By supporting the adoption and expansion of MHPs, governments can contribute to sustainable development goals such as SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 1 (No Poverty), while cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups.

**Key Data Points Needed**

1. Number of micro-hydro projects currently operational in Burkina Faso and their specific locations
2. Employment generated by micro-hydro power plants (e.g., number of people employed directly or indirectly)
3. Percentage reduction in firewood usage due to reliance on MHPs for energy generation
4. Annual income increase per household using MHPs as a result of new economic activities
5. Total cost savings attributed to reduced fuel consumption

**Data Gaps**

1. Detailed breakdown of employment opportunities created by MHPs across different sectors (e.g., construction, operation, maintenance)
2. Long-term sustainability analysis of micro-hydro projects in relation to ongoing climate variability
3. Comparative studies with other renewable energy sources like solar or wind power regarding their impact on rural economic diversification
4. Analysis of potential barriers and facilitators for scaling up micro-hydro power implementation in the West African Sahel region
5. Impact assessment on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provided by MHPs
