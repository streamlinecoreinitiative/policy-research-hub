# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in Caribbean Small Island Developing States: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean region is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including landslides, which pose significant risks to human life, infrastructure, and economic development. Climate change exacerbates these risks by altering precipitation patterns, increasing extreme weather events, and degrading soil stability. This brief highlights the importance of nature-based solutions in addressing landslide risk in Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS). We focus on three critical sectors: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change impacts agriculture by causing erratic rainfall patterns, leading to severe water scarcity in many regions. In the Caribbean SIDS, average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify], with precipitation variability of 600-1400 mm (NOAA climate dataset). Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly.

## Current Irrigation Practices

Traditional irrigation practices in the Caribbean SIDS rely heavily on fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Canal systems experience significant losses due to evaporation and seepage.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from agroforestry are essential for understanding its effectiveness in addressing climate-related challenges.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, generating power ranges from 10-50 kW per system with an energy efficiency of 70-80%. Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods can be significant, making micro-hydro systems a viable alternative for water security in the Caribbean SIDS.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated solutions combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective and sustainable solutions for climate-resilient water supply. Total project costs per hectare are estimated to be between $10,000-$25,000 [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of nature-based solutions in addressing landslide risk in Caribbean SIDS. Subsidies for farmers, grid integration with micro-hydro systems, and infrastructure development are essential for enhancing reliability and efficiency.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Integrate Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems**: Implement integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems to address severe water scarcity in the Caribbean SIDS.
2.  **Promote Renewable Energy**: Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources, such as micro-hydro power, to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
3.  **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Implement policy measures that support climate resilience, including subsidies for farmers, grid integration with micro-hydro systems, and infrastructure development.

## Closing Outlook

The Caribbean SIDS face significant challenges in addressing landslide risk, water security, and clean energy. Nature-based solutions, such as agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, offer a cost-effective and sustainable approach to addressing these challenges. By integrating these solutions with policy measures that promote climate resilience, we can reduce emissions from critical sectors and enhance the region's ability to adapt to climate change.

### Needed Evidence:

1.  **Climate Data**: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Caribbean SIDS (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2.  **Economic Analysis**: Economic analysis of traditional irrigation costs and micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Socioeconomic Studies**: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
