**Climate Resilient Water Supply Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Energy Access and Renewable Integration**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to strengthen climate-resilient water supply systems in Sub-Saharan Africa by improving access to safe drinking water and reliable energy sources. The region lags significantly behind the world in terms of access to safely managed drinking water [1] and electricity [2], exacerbating climate vulnerabilities. To address this, we recommend investing in solar-powered wells and other climate-resilient water supply systems, strengthening renewable energy integration to support water infrastructure, and implementing policies that prioritize off-grid renewable energy solutions for remote areas.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change, with over 70% of its population lacking access to safe drinking water [1] and electricity [2]. This situation disproportionately affects women who are often responsible for fetching water and children in schools without reliable power sources. Climate-related shocks like droughts have exacerbated these inequalities.

### Analysis

Evidence shows that Sub-Saharan Africa’s limited energy infrastructure hinders efforts to improve water security. Only 19.7% of the world's renewable energy consumption comes from this region, leaving communities reliant on fossil fuels for electricity generation [3]. This reliance increases their vulnerability during climate events such as droughts and floods.

Moreover, access to clean water is essential for health outcomes. Safe drinking water reduces waterborne diseases by at least 40%, according to UN-Water/WHO data [4]. However, only 73.7% of the world’s population has access to safely managed drinking water, with this figure dropping to just 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa [1].

Climate change impacts are further compounded by inadequate energy infrastructure. The region faces an estimated [VERIFY] people lacking safe water globally (UN-Water/WHO data) [4]. This highlights the urgent need for integrated climate-resilient solutions that address both water security and renewable energy access.

### Policy Recommendations

To enhance resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, focus should be placed on:

1. **Investing in Solar-Powered Wells**: Implementing solar-powered wells can provide sustainable access to safe drinking water in rural areas.
2. **Renewable Energy Integration for Water Infrastructure**: Integrate off-grid renewable energy solutions like solar and wind into existing water infrastructure projects.
3. **Promote Community-Based Solutions**: Encourage community-led initiatives that leverage local resources and knowledge.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementation of these recommendations requires:

- **Funding Mobilization**: Secure additional funding from international development partners, multilateral organizations, and private sector investors.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local technicians and engineers in solar installation and maintenance.
- **Policy Frameworks**: Develop supportive policies that incentivize renewable energy use for water infrastructure.

### Conclusion

Enhancing climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa through improved access to safe drinking water and reliable energy sources is critical. By investing in sustainable solutions, we can significantly reduce vulnerabilities to climate shocks and improve the quality of life for millions of people living in poverty.
