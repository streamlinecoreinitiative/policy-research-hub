# Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region is vulnerable to climate change impacts on agriculture, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from its vast wetlands. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers in communities already vulnerable to droughts. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use.

## Environmental Resilience through Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives

### Water Scarcity in the Great Lakes Region

Climate change is projected to increase water scarcity in the Great Lakes region, affecting agriculture and food security. Rising temperatures are altering precipitation patterns, leading to more frequent droughts and floods. The region's vast wetlands also contribute to increased evaporation, further exacerbating water scarcity.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation methods in the Great Lakes region rely on energy-intensive pumps and canals, which are costly to maintain and operate. These systems often lead to significant water loss through evaporation and seepage, reducing their overall efficiency.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making them an essential component of climate-resilient agriculture. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, farmers can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and increase energy efficiency.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology is a small-scale hydroelectric system that harnesses the power of water to generate electricity. When integrated with agroforestry practices, micro-hydro systems can provide a reliable source of renewable energy for irrigation, reducing costs and environmental impacts.

## Actions/Recommendations

*   Governments and policymakers should prioritize the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems.
*   Financial institutions and development agencies should provide funding and technical support for these integrated solutions.
*   Research institutions and universities should conduct further studies on the economic, social, and environmental impacts of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.

## Closing Outlook

Climate change poses significant challenges to agriculture in the Great Lakes region. However, by integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, farmers can enhance water security and renewable energy use, contributing to a more resilient and sustainable food system.
