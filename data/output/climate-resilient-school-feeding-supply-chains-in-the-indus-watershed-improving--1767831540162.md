# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Indus Watershed: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Indus watershed faces severe water scarcity due to historical droughts and changing precipitation patterns. This brief highlights the importance of integrated agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Indus Watershed

The Indus watershed is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, exacerbating climate-related challenges for communities and agriculture. The consequences are far-reaching:

*   **Context of Water Scarcity:**
    *   Droughts have become more frequent
    *   Current challenges in accessing reliable irrigation systems
*   **Current Challenges Faced by Farmers and Communities:**
    *   Limited access to efficient irrigation systems
    *   Economic instability due to reduced crop yields

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry practices offer a promising solution:

*   **Benefits of Integrating Agroforestry Practices (e.g., soil conservation, biodiversity, climate resilience):**
    *   Improved water retention and recharge through increased vegetation cover
    *   Enhanced ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, and carbon sequestration

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To ensure successful implementation:

*   **Key Policies Needed for Implementation (e.g., funding mechanisms, regulatory frameworks):**
    *   Public-private partnerships to support project development
    *   Collaborative efforts with local communities and organizations
*   **Steps Towards Policy Adoption and Implementation Strategies:**
    *   Stakeholder involvement in the decision-making process

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  Establish public-private partnerships to support project development.
2.  Collaborate with local communities and organizations to ensure effective implementation.
3.  Involve stakeholders in the decision-making process for policy adoption.

## Closing Outlook

The proposed agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a transformative solution for climate-resilient irrigation in the Indus watershed. By integrating these innovative approaches, farmers can improve their livelihoods and reduce vulnerability to climate variability.
