# Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and poverty. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a solution for climate-resilient irrigation. By integrating agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric systems, farmers can reduce their reliance on diesel generators, increase energy efficiency, and improve water retention.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Delta

The Lower Mekong delta is characterized by high levels of water insecurity due to climate change impacts on agriculture. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have resulted in reduced crop yields and decreased agricultural productivity. Existing irrigation systems are often inefficient, with significant losses through evaporation and seepage.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Climate-Resilient Solution

Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in improving water retention and reducing erosion.

### Benefits of Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems:

• Reduced reliance on diesel generators
• Increased energy efficiency
• Improved water retention
• Reduced erosion

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, policymakers should:

1.  **Develop targeted policies** to incentivize farmers to adopt climate-resilient irrigation practices.
2.  **Provide training and capacity-building programs** for farmers and extension agents on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Establish monitoring and evaluation frameworks** to track the effectiveness of these initiatives.

### Future Research Directions:

1.  **Economic impact**: Conduct detailed economic analyses to quantify the benefits of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for smallholder farmers.
2.  **Community engagement**: Investigate the role of community participation in the adoption and sustainability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The Lower Mekong delta faces unprecedented water scarcity and poverty challenges due to climate change impacts on agriculture. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for climate-resilient irrigation, addressing severe water scarcity and poverty through integrated solutions.
