**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing critical challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing renewable energy investments, improving water infrastructure, and strengthening early warning systems for climate adaptation. These interventions can significantly improve public health, economic productivity, and overall resilience against climate shocks.

* **Key Finding:** Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with [VERIFY] electricity access and only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water.
* **Recommendation:** Invest in renewable energy, enhance water infrastructure, and strengthen early warning systems for climate adaptation.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to nearly half of the world's population lacking safe drinking water (2.2 billion people) [1]. This region has one of the lowest rates of electricity access globally, with only 53.3% of its population having access to electricity [2].

* **Water Security:** Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to the global average of 73.7% [1].
* **Clean Energy:** The region lags behind globally with only 53.3% of its population having access to electricity, far below the world’s 91.6% and Sub-Saharan Africa's own 73.7% average [2].

## Analysis

Access to safe drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa is alarmingly low (32.4%), underscoring urgent needs for improved sanitation facilities, better filtration systems, and increased government investment [1]. Electricity access remains a significant challenge, with only 53.3% of the population having access (Sub-Saharan Africa's average) [2].

* **Access to Safe Drinking Water:** The disparity in access to safely managed drinking water highlights significant challenges in ensuring clean water supplies.
* **Electricity Access:** High costs and limited infrastructure are major barriers to expanding electricity grids.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy:** Increase renewable energy consumption from 9.2% to at least 15% by 2030, focusing on solar and wind power [3]. Provide subsidies for rural households and small businesses to reduce costs.
2. **Enhance Water Infrastructure:** Upgrade existing water treatment facilities and build new ones in underserved areas. Implement cost-sharing models with local communities to ensure sustainability.
3. **Strengthen Early Warning Systems:** Develop and implement early warning systems for climate-related hazards such as droughts, floods, and storms. Utilize existing technology like satellites and IoT devices for real-time monitoring [4].

## Implementation Considerations

* **Costs:** Costs associated with these interventions are substantial but can be mitigated through donor funding, grants, and low-interest loans from international organizations.
* **Potential Barriers:** Resistance to change by local communities who may not see immediate benefits, as well as technical challenges in setting up and maintaining new infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. By investing in renewable energy, improving water infrastructure, and enhancing early warning systems, the region can significantly improve public health, economic productivity, and overall resilience against climate shocks. Collaboration among governments, NGOs, and international partners is essential to achieving these goals.
