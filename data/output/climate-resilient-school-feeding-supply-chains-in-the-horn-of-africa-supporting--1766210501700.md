# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Horn of Africa: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe droughts and water scarcity that significantly impact food security and economic stability. The school feeding program, a critical component of education and nutrition for millions of children, is particularly exposed to these risks. This brief explores how integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains, supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By promoting sustainable irrigation methods and renewable energy use, we can improve water security, reduce poverty among smallholder farmers, and contribute to the region's overall development goals.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Horn of Africa**

The Horn of Africa is characterized by a semi-arid climate with limited rainfall, making it highly susceptible to droughts. Climate change exacerbates these conditions through increased evaporation from highland wetlands, erratic rainfall patterns, and rising temperatures. These changes significantly impact agricultural productivity, leading to food insecurity and economic instability among smallholder farmers who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Horn of Africa are often inefficient and unsustainable, relying heavily on diesel generators that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional methods such as boreholes and canals suffer from high water loss through evaporation (estimated at 30%) and seepage (5%). These inefficiencies further strain already limited water resources, exacerbating the region's water scarcity.

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion, increase water retention, and enhance crop yields. Case studies from similar regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving water management and reducing poverty among smallholder farmers.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution to irrigation needs by harnessing the power of rivers and streams. These systems provide a reliable source of renewable energy, significantly reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency. Pilot projects in the Horn of Africa have demonstrated the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of integrating micro-hydro with agroforestry.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a climate-resilient water supply for school feeding programs. This integrated approach not only addresses immediate water scarcity issues but also contributes to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of these systems at scale, we recommend:

1.  **Incentivizing investments:** Governments should provide financial incentives for farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Capacity building:** Training programs should be established to equip farmers with the skills needed to implement and maintain these integrated systems.
3.  **Scaling up:** Pilot projects should be scaled up to reach a larger number of smallholder farmers, ensuring wider adoption and impact.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security in the Horn of Africa. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains, supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. This approach not only improves water security but also contributes to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption.
