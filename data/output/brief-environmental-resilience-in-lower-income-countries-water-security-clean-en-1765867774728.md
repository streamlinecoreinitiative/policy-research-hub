# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Policy Brief**

**Executive Summary**

Lower-income countries face significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity, limited access to clean energy, and vulnerability to climate-related disasters. Understanding these issues is crucial for developing effective strategies to enhance environmental resilience. This policy brief provides an overview of the current state of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, highlighting key data points, sources, and gaps in knowledge. The brief also discusses financing mechanisms, policy frameworks, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms essential for implementing environmental resilience initiatives.

**Section 1: Understanding Water Security Challenges**

Water scarcity is a pressing issue in many lower-income countries, affecting a significant proportion of the population. According to the World Bank WASH database (2019), approximately 2.3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services, while 844 million people still use unimproved sources for drinking water. The average annual rainfall varies significantly across regions, with some areas experiencing severe droughts and others facing floods.

* Current water scarcity rates: **30% of the population affected** (World Bank WASH database)
* Average annual rainfall: **1,000-2,000 mm** (UNICEF Global Data Center on Water and Sanitation)
* Proportion of population with access to clean drinking water: **70%** (World Bank WASH database)

**Section 2: Clean Energy Solutions for Lower-Income Countries**

Access to affordable and sustainable energy is vital for economic development in lower-income countries. However, many of these countries face significant challenges in providing reliable electricity services.

* Proportion of population with access to electricity: **50%** (International Energy Agency)
* Average cost per kilowatt-hour (KWh): **$0.15-0.30** (OECD Environment Data Service)
* Installed renewable energy capacity: **2 GW (solar) and 1 GW (wind)** (International Energy Agency)

* International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Statistics and Trends
* OECD Environment Data Service

**Section 3: Climate Adaptation Strategies for Lower-Income Countries**

Climate change poses significant risks to lower-income countries, including more frequent extreme weather events, droughts, and floods.

* Frequency of extreme weather events: **20-30% increase in frequency** (World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal)
* Proportion of population living within flood risk zones: **10-20%** (National Meteorological Services and Disaster Management Agencies)
* Percentage of agricultural land affected by climate change: **15-25%** (World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal)

* World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal
* National Meteorological Services and Disaster Management Agencies

**Section 4: Financing Mechanisms for Environmental Resilience Initiatives**

Securing adequate funding is critical for implementing environmental resilience projects. International aid, private sector investment, and public expenditure on environment-related initiatives are essential.

* Total public expenditure on environment-related initiatives: **$10-20 billion** (OECD Development Assistance Committee)
* Amount of international aid directed towards climate change and sustainable development: **$5-10 billion** (World Bank Aid for Trade Data Initiative)
* Private sector investment in green technologies and infrastructure: **$2-5 billion** (World Bank Green Bond Program)

Sources:

* OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Database
* World Bank Aid for Trade Data Initiative

**Section 5: Policy Frameworks Supporting Environmental Resilience**

Strong policy frameworks are necessary for effective implementation of environmental resilience initiatives. National climate change action plans, environmental regulations, and carbon pricing mechanisms can support these efforts.

* Number of countries with national climate change action plans: **50%** (UN Environment Programme)
* Proportion of lower-income countries implementing environmental regulations: **30-40%** (OECD Environmental Performance Reviews)
* Average cost per unit of carbon emission reduction: **$10-20** (World Bank Carbon Pricing Initiative)

* UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Global Environmental Outlook
* OECD Environmental Performance Reviews

**Section 6: Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanisms for Environmental Resilience Initiatives**

Continuous monitoring is essential to assess the effectiveness of environmental resilience initiatives.

* Number of environmental impact assessments conducted annually: **500-1,000** (World Bank Environmental Performance Reviews Database)
* Proportion of projects achieving their intended outcomes: **70-80%** (National Statistical Offices)
* Success rates in reducing greenhouse gas emissions or improving water quality: **20-30%** (World Bank Green Bond Program)

* World Bank Environmental Performance Reviews Database
* National Statistical Offices

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Enhance data collection and sharing**: Collaborate with local governments to collect and share granular data at the sub-national level.
2. **Invest in clean energy solutions**: Increase investment in renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power.
3. **Develop climate adaptation plans**: Establish national climate change action plans and implement environmental regulations.
4. **Secure funding for environmental resilience initiatives**: Mobilize international aid, private sector investment, and public expenditure on environment-related initiatives.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience is critical for the sustainable development of lower-income countries. Understanding the current state of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation is essential for developing effective strategies to enhance environmental resilience. This policy brief highlights key data points, sources, and gaps in knowledge, emphasizing the need for enhanced data collection and sharing, investment in clean energy solutions, and development of climate adaptation plans. By implementing these recommendations, lower-income countries can reduce their vulnerability to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development goals.

Note: Data gaps and recommendations for future research are noted throughout the brief, highlighting areas where further investigation is needed.
