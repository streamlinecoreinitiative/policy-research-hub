# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and environmentally vulnerable regions in the world. Climate change exacerbates water scarcity, saltwater intrusion, and flooding, threatening food security, livelihoods, and ecosystems. This brief explores climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a solution to mitigate these impacts by promoting efficient water use, renewable energy integration, and climate adaptation. We examine existing initiatives, identify knowledge gaps, and provide policy recommendations for governments, private sector partners, and international organizations.

**Climate Vulnerability in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is prone to frequent floods, droughts, and cyclones due to its unique geography and climate. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns intensify these events, affecting over 150 million people who depend on agriculture, fishing, and other water-based livelihoods. Climate-related losses and damages in the region are estimated to be significant, with limited data available.

* Key statistics:
	+ The delta experiences frequent floods (over 100 days per year) and droughts (up to 50% crop yield loss).
	+ Over 70% of agricultural land is irrigated using fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
	+ Climate change may displace up to 20 million people by 2050 due to sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion.

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives: A Solution for the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives can help mitigate climate-related risks in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. These cooperatives promote efficient water use, renewable energy integration, and climate adaptation through:

* **Rainwater harvesting and storage**: Reducing dependence on groundwater and minimizing saltwater intrusion.
* **Solar-powered irrigation systems**: Decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-based irrigation.
* **Climate-resilient crop selection**: Promoting drought-tolerant and flood-resistant crops to ensure food security.

**Policy Recommendations for Implementing Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**

To scale up climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, we recommend:

1. **Develop policy frameworks**: Governments should establish policies supporting renewable energy integration, efficient water use, and climate adaptation.
2. **Establish public-private partnerships**: Collaborations between governments, private sector partners, and international organizations can facilitate access to finance, technology, and expertise.
3. **Capacity building and training**: Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for farmers, cooperatives, and government officials.
4. **Monitoring and evaluation**: Establish a monitoring system to track progress, identify challenges, and inform policy decisions.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Governments should allocate dedicated funds for climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
2. International organizations should provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for governments and private sector partners.
3. Private sector companies should invest in renewable energy solutions, efficient water use technologies, and climate-resilient crop selection.
4. Farmers' cooperatives should prioritize climate-smart irrigation practices and advocate for policy support.

**Closing Outlook**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical region where climate change impacts are already being felt. Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution to mitigate these impacts by promoting efficient water use, renewable energy integration, and climate adaptation. With the right policies, partnerships, and investments, we can help build resilience in this vulnerable region and contribute to global efforts to address climate change.

**Key Data Points Needed**

1. Cost-benefit analysis comparing traditional irrigation systems versus climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.
2. Survey results on farmer willingness-to-pay and perceived value of different climate-resilient crop selections.
3. Case study testimonials from farmers who have benefited from climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
4. Comparison with similar successful climate adaptation initiatives in other water-scarce regions.
