# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Horn of Africa: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Comprehensive Policy Blueprint**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in infrastructure projects to improve access to clean drinking water. This includes implementing community-based water management systems for sustainable resource use, promoting rainwater harvesting and sanitation facilities to reduce reliance on groundwater, and developing microgrids and off-grid renewable energy solutions in rural areas.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water, electricity, and adapting to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods. Despite global progress in reducing population lacking safe water (2.2 billion people in 2022) [1], Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only a third of the population having access to safely managed drinking water ([VERIFY] 32.4% in 2024) [2]. Similarly, electricity access is unevenly distributed, leaving millions without reliable power sources (53.3% access rate in 2023) [3].

### Analysis

#### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe shortage of safe drinking water, especially in rural areas where only [VERIFY] % of the population has access to safely managed water sources [1]. This gap poses health risks and hinders economic growth.

* Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of global resources (2021) [4], highlighting the need for efficient use.
* SDG 6 progress indicates 74% global coverage in safely managed water, but Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind [5].

#### Clean Energy Access

While progress is being made globally (19.7% renewable energy consumption in 2020), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 53.3% of its population having access to electricity [2]. The region's reliance on fossil fuels for power generation contributes to environmental degradation and economic disparities.

* Renewable energy consumption has increased globally, but Sub-Saharan Africa's share remains low.
* Access to electricity is crucial for economic growth and poverty reduction.

#### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts, such as increased frequency of extreme weather events like floods and droughts, threaten food security and water availability in Sub-Saharan Africa. Without robust adaptation strategies, these challenges could exacerbate existing vulnerabilities.

* Drought-resistant crops and irrigation technologies can help mitigate climate-related risks.
* Early warning systems are essential for mitigating the impact of extreme weather events.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Invest in infrastructure projects to improve access to clean drinking water (e.g., community-based water management systems).
	* Promote rainwater harvesting and sanitation facilities to reduce reliance on groundwater.
2. **Expand Clean Energy Access**:
	* Develop microgrids and off-grid renewable energy solutions in rural areas.
	* Encourage solar-powered mini-grids for remote communities where grid extension is not feasible.
3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation**:
	* Integrate climate risk assessments into water management and agricultural planning.
	* Promote early warning systems to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Funding**: Mobilize international development aid, particularly from multilateral organizations like the World Bank, to support these interventions.
2. **Capacity Building**: Train local government officials and community leaders in water management and climate resilience strategies.
3. **Monitoring & Evaluation**: Establish robust monitoring systems to track progress towards SDG 6 (water), SDG 7 (energy), and SDG 13 (climate action).

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience to achieve sustainable development. By implementing evidence-based policy recommendations and considering local contexts, governments and international partners can create a roadmap for achieving these critical objectives.
