# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Andean highlands: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Andean Highlands: Stabilizing Food Security During Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces severe water scarcity and climate change impacts, including rising sea levels and altered precipitation patterns. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for vulnerable communities. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use.

This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, highlighting their benefits for water retention, soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Pilot projects demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and scalability of these integrated solutions, with significant potential to improve food security during droughts.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

The region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, floods), and altered precipitation patterns. These changes have severe consequences for agriculture:

• **Water scarcity**: Changes in rainfall patterns and increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures exacerbate water scarcity.
• **Soil salinization**: Rising sea levels contaminate freshwater sources with saltwater, reducing crop yields and affecting soil fertility.
• **Loss of arable land**: Coastal erosion and flooding lead to the loss of productive agricultural land.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Traditional irrigation methods in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta are often energy-intensive, relying on diesel generators or fossil fuels. This approach contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbates economic challenges for vulnerable communities. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a sustainable alternative:

• **Water retention**: Agroforestry practices improve soil health, increasing water retention capacity.
• **Renewable energy**: Micro-hydro systems harness the power of flowing water, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.
• **Carbon sequestration**: Agroforestry systems promote biodiversity, contributing to carbon sequestration.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale:

1.  **Invest in research and development**: Conduct detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro solutions.
2.  **Develop policy frameworks**: Establish supportive policies for scaling up these climate-resilient water supply systems, including incentives for community-led initiatives.
3.  **Enhance community engagement**: Foster partnerships between local communities, government agencies, and private sector stakeholders to ensure effective implementation and maintenance of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.

**Closing Outlook**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces unprecedented climate-related challenges that threaten the livelihoods of millions of people. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for enhancing water security, renewable energy use, and climate resilience in this critical region. By supporting policy reforms and scaling up integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects, we can help stabilize food security during droughts and promote sustainable development.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Support research on cost-benefit analyses**: Conduct detailed studies comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro solutions.
2.  **Develop policy frameworks for scaling up climate-resilient water supply systems**: Establish supportive policies and incentives for community-led initiatives.
3.  **Enhance community engagement and partnerships**: Foster collaborations between local communities, government agencies, and private sector stakeholders to ensure effective implementation and maintenance of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.

**Data Gaps:**

*   Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected coastal regions in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta.
*   Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
*   Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
