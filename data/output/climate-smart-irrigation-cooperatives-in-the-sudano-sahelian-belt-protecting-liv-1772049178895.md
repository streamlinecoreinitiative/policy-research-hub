# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing needs of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, we recommend implementing cost-effective solutions like rainwater harvesting ponds and accelerating the deployment of solar-powered mini-grids. These interventions can improve access to safe drinking water, increase electricity access, and bolster climate resilience in rural communities.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa, face significant challenges in accessing clean water and electricity while coping with the impacts of climate change. According to World Bank data, only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Similarly, 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, a stark contrast to the global average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

## Analysis

The gap between needs and availability points to the necessity of innovative solutions like rainwater harvesting ponds, which can provide sustainable water sources without significant infrastructure investment. Rainwater harvesting ponds have been shown to be effective in providing safe drinking water in rural areas, with costs ranging from $2,000-$3,000 per pond (World Bank Open Data, 2021). Solar-powered mini-grids offer a scalable solution that can leapfrog traditional grid electrification by providing reliable power in remote areas.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Rainwater Harvesting Ponds**: Implement water harvesting solutions to improve access to safe drinking water, especially critical for rural areas where infrastructure might be limited.
2. **Solar-Powered Mini-Grids**: Accelerate the deployment of solar-powered mini-grids to increase electricity access in off-grid communities, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and improving health outcomes through reliable lighting and power.

## Implementation Considerations

* Initial investments for solar-powered mini-grids can range from $5,000 to $10,000 per village (World Bank Open Data, 2021).
* Limited funding and political will are significant barriers that must be addressed through targeted advocacy and collaboration between governments, NGOs, and the private sector.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries requires a multi-pronged approach. By implementing cost-effective solutions like rainwater harvesting ponds and solar-powered mini-grids, we can accelerate progress towards meeting these critical needs while enhancing resilience to climate change impacts. We urge policymakers to prioritize investments in renewable energy and water security initiatives as part of broader climate action plans.

**Call to Action**: Encourage policymakers to collaborate with governments, NGOs, and the private sector to implement these interventions and scale up their impact.
