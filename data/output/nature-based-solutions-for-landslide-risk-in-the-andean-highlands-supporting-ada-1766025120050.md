**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Andean highlands are one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent landslides posing significant risks to communities and ecosystems. As countries strive to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, nature-based solutions can play a crucial role in enhancing environmental resilience. This brief explores the potential of micro-investment platforms for supporting solar-powered water filters (SPWFs) in rural India as a model for addressing landslide risk and promoting climate adaptation.

**Section 1: Introduction to Environmental Resilience Challenges in Lower-Income Countries**

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in achieving environmental resilience, particularly when it comes to managing natural hazards like landslides. Climate change exacerbates these risks, threatening the livelihoods of millions of people. In the Andean highlands, for example, landslides have devastating consequences on agriculture, infrastructure, and human settlements.

**Section 2: Current Status and Limitations of Traditional Approaches**

Traditional approaches to addressing landslide risk often rely on engineering-based solutions that may not be feasible or effective in lower-income settings. Existing water supply systems, such as bore wells and rainwater harvesting, can also be inadequate due to factors like limited infrastructure, lack of maintenance, and insufficient funding.

**Section 3: Micro-Investment Platforms for Supporting Nature-Based Solutions**

Micro-investment platforms offer a promising approach to financing nature-based solutions, including SPWFs. These platforms leverage community-led initiatives, ensuring that vital resources are accessible and affordable to all. By supporting innovative solutions like SPWFs, micro-investment platforms can accelerate the adoption of clean technology among vulnerable populations.

**Benefits of Solar-Powered Water Filters (SPWFs)**

SPWFs offer numerous benefits for health, environment, and economic development:

• **Improved Health Outcomes**: Access to clean drinking water reduces the risk of water-borne diseases.
• **Environmental Benefits**: SPWFs reduce pressure on natural resources, minimizing the impact of human activities on ecosystems.
• **Economic Development**: By providing reliable access to clean water, SPWFs can boost agricultural productivity and local economies.

**Challenges and Solutions in Implementing Micro-Investment Platforms**

Potential barriers to adoption include:

* Community engagement and buy-in
* Technological limitations and scalability
* Limited funding and resources

Strategies for overcoming these challenges include:
• Public-private partnerships for resource mobilization
• Community involvement in project design and implementation
• Capacity building and technical assistance for local stakeholders

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Support the development of micro-investment platforms** to finance nature-based solutions, including SPWFs.
2. **Encourage public-private partnerships** to leverage resources and expertise.
3. **Invest in community-led initiatives**, ensuring that vulnerable populations have access to clean technology.

**Closing Outlook**

As countries strive to meet their NDCs under the Paris Agreement, nature-based solutions can play a vital role in enhancing environmental resilience. Micro-investment platforms offer a promising approach for supporting SPWFs and other innovative solutions in lower-income settings. By addressing landslide risk and promoting climate adaptation, these initiatives can contribute to improved health outcomes, environmental sustainability, and economic development.
