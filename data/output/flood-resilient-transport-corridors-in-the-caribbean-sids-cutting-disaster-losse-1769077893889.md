**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Caribbean SIDS: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, particularly flooding, which can have devastating impacts on transportation infrastructure and communities. This policy brief recommends prioritizing flood-resilient transport corridors as a critical strategy to reduce disaster losses and improve the resilience of these islands.

Key findings:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan African population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)].
* The Caribbean SIDS are highly exposed to flooding due to their geography and climate.
* Investing in flood-resilient transport corridors can reduce disaster losses by up to 30% [World Bank, 2022].

Recommendations:

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Implement targeted interventions for water security, including rainwater harvesting systems in urban and peri-urban areas, and solar-powered wells for rural communities.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Access**: Invest in off-grid renewable energy solutions such as solar home systems to increase access to electricity.
3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Measures**: Develop early-warning systems for climate-related disasters, focusing on regions most vulnerable (e.g., coastal areas prone to flooding).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], there is an urgent need to address these issues to ensure sustainable development and livelihoods for millions of vulnerable communities.

## Analysis

Water scarcity disproportionately affects vulnerable populations such as women, children, and rural communities. Limited access to safe drinking water leads to poor health outcomes, including diarrhea-related illnesses that can be fatal for young children [UN-Water/WHO, 2022]. Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events such as droughts and floods, further straining water resources and infrastructure.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Implement rainwater harvesting systems in urban and peri-urban areas.
	* Promote solar-powered wells for rural communities, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Access**:
	* Invest in off-grid renewable energy solutions such as solar home systems to increase access to electricity.
	* Encourage public-private partnerships for the deployment of clean energy technologies.
3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Develop early-warning systems for climate-related disasters, focusing on regions most vulnerable (e.g., coastal areas prone to flooding).
	* Implement climate-resilient infrastructure projects such as flood control measures and drought-resistant agriculture.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimated costs range from $10-$20 billion annually for water security initiatives [Source: World Bank, 2022]. Climate adaptation measures may require additional funding but can be more cost-effective in the long run [World Bank, 2022].

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for building resilient communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing targeted policy measures, leveraging existing technologies, and fostering public-private partnerships, governments can significantly improve living conditions while laying a foundation for sustainable development amidst climate change impacts.
