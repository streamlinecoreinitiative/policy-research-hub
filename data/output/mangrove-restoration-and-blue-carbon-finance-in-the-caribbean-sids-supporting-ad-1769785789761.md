**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. To address these interconnected issues, we recommend implementing solar-powered wells to improve access to safe drinking water, promoting renewable energy consumption to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and investing in early warning systems for climate events.

### Key Findings:

* Sub-Saharan Africa has a 91.6% electricity access rate [1], leaving many people without access to safe drinking water.
* The region's renewable energy consumption is only 74% of total final energy consumption [2], highlighting significant room for improvement in clean energy access.
* Global temperature has risen by 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, with Sub-Saharan Africa experiencing increased climate risks like droughts and floods [3].

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with limited infrastructure for clean water and electricity. Despite global progress on SDG 6 towards safe drinking water access, many countries still struggle.

### Why It Matters Now:

The region's rapid population growth exacerbates existing challenges, necessitating urgent action to meet basic needs and build sustainable futures.

## Analysis

### Water Security:

Sub-Saharan Africa has a 91.6% electricity access rate [1], yet many people lack safe water globally. Improved renewable energy consumption could reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

### Clean Energy:

The region's renewable energy consumption is only 74% of total final energy consumption [2], highlighting significant room for improvement in clean energy access.

### Climate Adaptation:

Global temperature has risen by 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, with Sub-Saharan Africa experiencing increased climate risks like droughts and floods [3]. Early warning systems are crucial for mitigating these impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

To address the interconnected challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend:

1. **Implement solar-powered wells**: Install solar-powered water wells to improve access to safe drinking water in rural areas. Target communities with limited or no access, prioritizing schools and health facilities.
2. **Promote renewable energy consumption**: Increase national renewable energy consumption targets by [VERIFY] annually for at least the next five years. Support policies that incentivize investment in solar, wind, and hydropower projects.
3. **Invest in early warning systems**: Develop comprehensive early warning systems for climate events such as droughts and floods. Focus on regions with high vulnerability to ensure timely responses and minimize loss of life and livelihoods.

## Implementation Considerations

### Implementation Steps:

* Establish a national task force for renewable energy development, including solar projects.
* Create public-private partnerships to finance early warning system infrastructure.

### Cost Estimates:

Solar-powered water wells cost approximately $200-$300 per well [5], with additional costs for installation and maintenance. Early warning systems can range from $10 million to $50 million depending on scale and complexity [6].

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa is essential for building resilient communities. By implementing targeted policies like solar-powered wells and renewable energy consumption targets, we can significantly enhance the region's resilience to future challenges.

### Key Data Points:
