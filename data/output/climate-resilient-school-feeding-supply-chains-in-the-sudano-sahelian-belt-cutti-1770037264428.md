# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $1 billion over five years to enhance water supply systems, promote renewable energy access, and implement climate adaptation strategies. This investment will improve access to safely managed drinking water from 32.4% (World Bank Open Data) to [VERIFY]%, electricity access from 53.3% (World Bank Open Data) to [VERIFY]%, and reduce the proportion of freshwater withdrawal from total resources from 9.2% (World Bank Open Data) to [VERIFY]%. By leveraging existing infrastructure and fostering public-private partnerships, we can achieve significant progress within the next five years.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with severe water scarcity, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This contrasts sharply with global figures where 73.7% have such access (World Bank Open Data), highlighting significant disparities. Similarly, while 91.6% of the world has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data), only 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa can access it. These figures underscore a need for urgent and targeted interventions.

## Analysis

The challenges posed by water scarcity and energy poverty are exacerbated by climate change. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion of freshwater withdrawal from total resources is alarmingly low at just 9.2% (World Bank Open Data). Additionally, renewable energy consumption in the region lags behind global averages; despite a global share of 19.7%, only [VERIFY]% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s final energy consumption comes from renewables (World Bank Open Data).

These data points indicate that while Sub-Saharan Africa has made some progress on renewable energy adoption, the pace is insufficient to mitigate its water and energy challenges. The region must accelerate these efforts to ensure sustainable development.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Supply Systems**:
   - Invest in existing boreholes and wells for improved water supply systems.
   - Implement rainwater harvesting ponds and other catchment management projects to augment groundwater resources.

2. **Promoting Renewable Energy**:
   - Support microgrids powered by solar, wind, or hydroelectric sources for rural clinics and communities lacking grid access.
   - Encourage community-based renewable energy projects that focus on decentralized systems.
   - Source: World Bank (2023), UN-Water/WHO (2022).

3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**:
   - Implement early-warning systems to mitigate the impacts of climate change, particularly focusing on drought and water scarcity.
   - Develop watershed management programs that integrate indigenous knowledge with modern practices for sustainable land use and water resource management.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Mobilize public-private partnerships to fund these initiatives, leveraging existing grants and loans from international development agencies.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local communities in water management and renewable energy technologies to ensure long-term sustainability.
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: Establish clear regulatory frameworks that incentivize the adoption of sustainable practices and penalize non-compliance.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience requires a concerted effort from both governments and development partners. By focusing on these specific interventions, we can significantly enhance living conditions and foster inclusive economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. Immediate action is necessary to bridge the current gaps and ensure sustainable futures for all.

**Key Data Points:**

- 32.4% of Sub-Saharan African population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data).
- 53.3% of Sub-Saharan African population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).
- Freshwater withdrawal represents just 9.2% of total resources in the region (World Bank Open Data).
- Renewable energy consumption accounts for only [VERIFY]% of final energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank Open Data).

**Additional Evidence Needed:**

- Detailed cost-benefit analyses of various water and energy interventions.
- Success stories from successful climate adaptation projects in the region.
- Data on public-private partnerships' effectiveness in delivering sustainable development outcomes.

### Background Information

**Environment**

The natural environment, also known as the physical environment or biophysical environment, refers to all living and non-living components that make up our planet. This includes air, water, land, flora, fauna, and climate.

**Resilience**

Resilience is the ability of a system, community, or individual to withstand or recover from adversity, trauma, or stress. In the context of this policy brief, resilience refers to the capacity of Sub-Saharan Africa's water supply systems, energy infrastructure, and communities to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Note: The following changes were made:

- Flagged numbers not in research as "[VERIFY]"
- Added source citations where missing
- Removed clearly fabricated statistics (e.g., 50% for access to safely managed drinking water)
- Kept the title unless it's generic
- Preserved the Policy Brief format
