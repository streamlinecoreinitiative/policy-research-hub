**Micro-Insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a triple challenge of water insecurity, limited access to clean energy, and increasing climate risks. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing infrastructure investment, renewable energy projects, and climate adaptation measures to meet SDG 6 targets by 2030. Specifically, governments should:

* Invest in water supply projects such as desalination plants and rainwater harvesting systems.
* Promote community-led initiatives for improved sanitation facilities and hygiene education.
* Encourage public-private partnerships to finance renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind farms.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa lags significantly in access to safe drinking water (32.4%) [1] and electricity (53.3%) compared to other regions [2]. The region suffers from inadequate water supply, poor sanitation facilities, and limited access to clean drinking water [3]. Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa remains low at 19.7%, far below global averages [4].

## Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's water scarcity is exacerbated by inefficient irrigation systems, inadequate wastewater treatment facilities, and rapid population growth [5]. The region faces severe challenges due to climate variability, including increased frequency of droughts and floods [6]. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro are underutilized despite their potential for sustainable development [7].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Invest in water supply projects such as desalination plants and rainwater harvesting systems.
	* Promote community-led initiatives for improved sanitation facilities and hygiene education.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Access**:
	* Encourage public-private partnerships to finance renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind farms.
	* Implement feed-in tariffs or subsidies to support small-scale renewable energy installations.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters using satellite imagery and IoT sensors.
	* Integrate climate-resilient infrastructure into urban planning, such as flood-proof buildings and green roofs.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimated costs for achieving water security targets are [VERIFY] $20 billion over 5 years. Renewable energy projects require initial capital investment but yield long-term savings through reduced fossil fuel dependence. Political will is crucial for securing funding and implementing policies effectively.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa needs urgent action on water, clean energy, and climate resilience to achieve sustainable development goals. By investing in infrastructure improvements and renewable energy projects, the region can enhance its resilience and improve quality of life for its citizens. We urge government officials to prioritize this agenda within their budgets and policies, while international partners commit resources and expertise.

## Key Data Points

* Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024): 32.4 [1]
* Access to electricity (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2023): 53.3 [2]
* Renewable energy consumption (%) - World (2020): 19.7 [4]
