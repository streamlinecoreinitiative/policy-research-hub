# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

We recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience challenges. This approach combines community-based water management with renewable energy adoption and climate adaptation strategies. By investing in these cooperatives, governments and development partners can:

* Increase access to clean water for 1 million people by 2025 [NEEDS SOURCE]
* Promote the use of solar-powered irrigation systems, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by 30% [NEEDS SOURCE]
* Enhance climate resilience through early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security and electricity access. The region is home to 2.2 billion people lacking safe water resources, accounting for about 15% of the global population without access [Source: UN-Water/WHO]. Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing variability and unpredictability of weather patterns, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.

## Analysis

### Water Security:

* Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 2.2 billion people lacking safe water resources, accounting for about 15% of the global population without access [Source: UN-Water/WHO]
* The region's freshwater withdrawal stands at 9.2%, highlighting significant resource constraints [Source: World Bank Open Data]

### Electricity Access:

* Despite progress in expanding electricity grids, Sub-Saharan Africa continues to struggle with uneven distribution and reliability
* Current statistics indicate that only 40% of its population has access to reliable power [NEEDS SOURCE]

### Renewable Energy Consumption:

* The region's renewable energy consumption is relatively low at 19.7%, compared to the global average of 19.7%
* This underutilization presents an opportunity for increased investment in clean energy sources

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Partner with local communities and governments to establish climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, promoting the use of solar-powered irrigation systems and efficient water management practices.

## Implementation Considerations

The implementation of these recommendations will require a coordinated effort among government agencies, international organizations, and local communities. Key considerations include:

* **Funding Mechanisms**: Establish dedicated funds for clean water projects and renewable energy initiatives. Explore innovative financing mechanisms like carbon credits and green bonds.
	* Source: World Bank Open Data
* **Capacity Building**: Train local officials in water management and climate adaptation strategies. Provide technical assistance to ensure project sustainability and effectiveness.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience are urgent and multifaceted. By adopting a comprehensive approach that combines policy interventions with community-driven initiatives, we can create a more resilient future for the region. It is imperative that governments, NGOs, and development partners work together to implement these recommendations.
