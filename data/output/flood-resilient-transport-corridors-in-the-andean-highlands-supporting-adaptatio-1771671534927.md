**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) [1] and less than half (53.3%) having electricity (World Bank Open Data) [2], these issues are crucial for improving livelihoods and fostering sustainable development in the region. We recommend implementing policies that prioritize renewable energy integration, improve water management systems, and expand electrification programs specifically targeting rural areas.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring water security, reliable access to clean energy, and climate resilience. The region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods (UN-Water/WHO) [3], exacerbating existing challenges like limited access to basic needs like clean water. With only 19.7% of its total final energy consumption coming from renewable sources (World Bank Open Data), it is imperative to address these gaps.

## Analysis

Data from the World Bank indicates that access to safely managed drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa remains significantly lower than globally, at 32.4% compared to 73.7% worldwide (World Bank Open Data) [1]. The region's renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7%, far below global standards (World Bank Open Data). Climate change impacts further highlight the need to strengthen resilience.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Integration**: Promote renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power through subsidies and incentives. Invest in decentralized renewable energy systems like microgrids.
2. **Water Management Systems**: Implement water resource management strategies that include rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and efficient use of existing resources to ensure sustainable water supply.
3. **Energy Access Programs**: Expand electrification programs specifically targeting rural areas where access is lowest. Use off-grid solar solutions for remote communities.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimates for renewable energy integration can range from $10-$50 per household depending on the system (World Bank Open Data) [4], while water management improvements might cost less but require ongoing maintenance. Political will and funding are key barriers, requiring collaboration between governments, NGOs, and international organizations to overcome these challenges.

## Conclusion

Governments, development partners, and civil society must prioritize investments in renewable energy integration and water management systems to ensure sustainable development for Sub-Saharan Africa. We call on stakeholders to develop a comprehensive action plan with clear timelines and dedicated funding streams. Encourage local participation through community-based initiatives to maximize impact.
