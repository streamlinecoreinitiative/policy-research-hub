# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Caribbean SIDS: raising resilience finance for communities

**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in Caribbean SIDS: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

We recommend that governments, NGOs, and private sector entities collaborate to establish watershed co-management programs with indigenous councils in Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This initiative will enhance environmental resilience by promoting water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Specifically:

* Invest in infrastructure projects such as water supply and sanitation systems to increase access to safe drinking water.
* Encourage the adoption of clean technologies like solar power through subsidies or grants.
* Develop early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans to mitigate climate-related risks.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Recent data highlights the urgency of these issues:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024].
* Renewable energy consumption stands at merely 19.7%, far below global targets set by SDG6 [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020].

## Analysis

The region's vulnerability to climate change exacerbates existing challenges:

* Freshwater withdrawal is a significant issue worldwide, with [VERIFY] % of resources used globally [NEEDS SOURCE].
* Climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods pose significant risks to communities.

## Policy Recommendations

We recommend the following actions to enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa:

1. **Invest in water security infrastructure**: Allocate funds for water supply and sanitation systems, particularly in rural areas where coverage is lowest.
2. **Promote clean energy access**: Provide subsidies or grants for clean technologies like solar power, and implement supportive policies that promote renewable energy generation and consumption.
3. **Develop climate adaptation strategies**: Establish early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans to mitigate climate-related risks.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementation of these recommendations will require collaboration between governments, NGOs, and the private sector. Cost estimates vary but can be significant; however, the benefits in terms of improved health outcomes and economic stability make it worthwhile. Potential barriers include high initial costs, lack of technical expertise, and political resistance.

## Conclusion

To achieve sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa, concerted efforts are needed to enhance water security, expand clean energy access, and improve climate resilience. By taking swift action now, the region can pave a pathway towards a more resilient future.
