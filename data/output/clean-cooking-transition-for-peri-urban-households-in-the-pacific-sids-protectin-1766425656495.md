# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Pacific SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are particularly vulnerable to climate change, with severe impacts on their water security and ability to adapt to climate stress. This brief focuses on peri-urban households in these regions, highlighting the need for a transition to clean cooking practices that are resilient to climate-related disruptions.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges

### Water Security

*   Climate change is altering rainfall patterns and increasing water scarcity in the Pacific SIDS. [verify]
*   Peri-urban households often rely on unreliable or inadequate water sources, exacerbating food insecurity and economic instability.
*   Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can improve irrigation efficiency and reduce reliance on diesel generators.

### Clean Energy

*   Access to electricity is limited in many Pacific SIDS. [verify]
*   Micro-hydro technology offers a scalable solution for clean energy generation, particularly in mountainous regions.
*   Integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can enhance energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

### Climate Adaptation

*   Climate-related stressors (e.g., droughts, floods) are increasingly affecting peri-urban households in the Pacific SIDS. [verify]
*   Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can provide a climate-resilient water supply, supporting food security and economic stability.
*   Community engagement and participatory approaches are essential for successful implementation and scaling up.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Subsidies and Low-Interest Loans:** Governments should offer incentives to support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in peri-urban areas.
2.  **Infrastructure Development:** Investments in infrastructure (e.g., roads, storage facilities) are necessary for efficient implementation and maintenance of these integrated systems.
3.  **Capacity Building and Training:** Local communities should receive training on system design, operation, and maintenance to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices is crucial for peri-urban households in the Pacific SIDS, particularly under climate stress conditions. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution, addressing water security and climate adaptation needs simultaneously. To achieve meaningful impact, policy makers must prioritize support for community-led initiatives, infrastructure development, and capacity building efforts.

### Needed Evidence

1.  **Climate Data:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Pacific SIDS (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2.  **Economic Analysis:** Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3.  **Socioeconomic Studies:** Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
