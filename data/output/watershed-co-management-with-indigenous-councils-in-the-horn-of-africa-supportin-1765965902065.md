# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant threats to lower-income countries, particularly those in the Horn of Africa. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events exacerbate water scarcity, undermine food security, and compromise livelihoods. Effective adaptation strategies are crucial for building resilience in these communities. This brief explores the potential of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a means to support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). It highlights the importance of integrating traditional knowledge and local institutions into water management practices, promoting sustainable use of natural resources, and enhancing climate change resilience.

## Current Climate Challenges in Coastal Communities

The Horn of Africa is characterized by arid and semi-arid conditions, making it vulnerable to droughts and desertification. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are projected to worsen water scarcity, affecting agriculture, livestock, and human consumption. The region's coastal communities face additional challenges due to sea-level rise, increased flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.

### Key Challenges:

• **Water Scarcity:** Decreased rainfall, increased evaporation, and growing demand for water exacerbate scarcity.
• **Food Insecurity:** Crop failures, reduced livestock productivity, and decreased fisheries threaten food availability and access.
• **Climate-Related Disasters:** Increased frequency and severity of droughts, floods, and storms compromise human safety and livelihoods.

## Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils: A Proven Approach

Watershed co-management involves the collaborative management of water resources among local communities, governments, and other stakeholders. This approach recognizes the importance of traditional knowledge and local institutions in sustainable natural resource management. By integrating indigenous councils into watershed management practices, communities can:

### Benefits:

• **Improved Water Management:** Traditional knowledge informs conservation and efficient use of water resources.
• **Enhanced Climate Resilience:** Communities develop adaptive capacity through co-management experiences.
• **Increased Livelihood Opportunities:** Sustainable agriculture, livestock, and fisheries promote economic stability.

## Case Studies and Impact Analysis

Several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Horn of Africa:

### Examples:

• **Ethiopia's Oromia Region:** Community-led water harvesting initiatives increased crop yields by 30% and reduced water scarcity.
• **Kenya's Lake Victoria Basin:** Collaborative management of fisheries and wetlands restored fish populations and improved livelihoods.

## Challenges, Opportunities, and Policy Recommendations

Despite the potential benefits of watershed co-management with indigenous councils, several challenges must be addressed:

### Barriers to Implementation:

• **Funding Constraints:** Limited financial resources hinder community-led initiatives.
• **Insurance Literacy:** Low awareness of climate-related risks and insurance options hampers adaptation efforts.

### Opportunities for Scaling Up:

• **International Support:** Increased funding and technical assistance from international organizations can leverage local capacities.
• **Policy Frameworks:** Governments can establish supportive policies and regulations to facilitate watershed co-management.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Integrate Indigenous Knowledge:** Incorporate traditional knowledge into water management practices to enhance climate resilience.
2.  **Strengthen Local Institutions:** Empower indigenous councils through capacity-building programs, ensuring their effective participation in decision-making processes.
3.  **Promote Climate-Resilient Agriculture:** Support sustainable agriculture practices and provide climate-resilient crop varieties to improve food security.
4.  **Establish Policy Frameworks:** Governments should develop supportive policies and regulations to facilitate watershed co-management.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils offers a promising approach for building resilience in lower-income countries, particularly those in the Horn of Africa. By integrating traditional knowledge and local institutions into water management practices, communities can promote sustainable use of natural resources, enhance climate change resilience, and support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. Addressing challenges such as funding constraints and insurance literacy is crucial to scaling up these initiatives. International organizations, governments, and local stakeholders must work together to create an enabling environment for watershed co-management with indigenous councils, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and sustainable future.

**Data Gaps:**

*   Longitudinal impact studies to assess the long-term benefits of watershed co-management in reducing poverty and increasing resilience.
*   Detailed cost-benefit analysis comparing watershed co-management with other forms of financial assistance during natural disasters.
*   Specific data on how climate change specifically affects coastal communities, providing a clearer picture for targeted insurance schemes.
