# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Andean highlands: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Enhancing Disaster Resilience**

**Executive Summary**

The Andean highlands face significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity and climate change impacts on agriculture. This brief explores a critical aspect of resilience – energy access – focusing on peri-urban households' transition to clean cooking methods.

**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges**

The Andean highlands experience:

* Erratic rainfall patterns and precipitation variability [verify]
* Water loss percentages from traditional irrigation systems:
	+ Evaporation: 30% (estimated)
	+ Seepage: 5% (estimated)

Climate change impacts agriculture, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns. Traditional methods are energy-intensive.

**Current Energy Access and Cooking Practices**

Peri-urban households rely on:

* Charcoal or wood for cooking
* Borehole pumps consuming [verify] kWh/day
* Canal systems losing [verify]% due to evaporation and seepage

The economic impact assessment indicates a cost per hectare of $100-$200 (estimated).

**Transitioning to Clean Cooking Methods: Renewable Energy Integration**

Renewable energy sources, such as solar or biogas, can provide:

* Cost savings compared to traditional methods
* Reduced greenhouse gas emissions
* Improved air quality and health benefits

The integration of renewable energy with sustainable water management practices is essential for climate resilience.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the transition to clean cooking methods, policy measures should include:

* Incentives for households (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with renewable energy systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research directions should focus on:

* Economic impact assessments of integrated solutions
* Community acceptance studies and long-term sustainability evaluations

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop a comprehensive policy framework**: Support the transition to clean cooking methods through incentives, grid integration, and infrastructure development.
2. **Conduct community-based assessments**: Evaluate household energy needs, preferences, and willingness to adopt renewable energy sources.
3. **Establish partnerships for technology transfer**: Collaborate with international organizations, NGOs, or private sector companies to promote the adoption of integrated solutions.

**Closing Outlook**

The transition to clean cooking methods in peri-urban households is critical for reducing disaster losses and promoting environmental resilience in lower-income countries. The integration of renewable energy sources with sustainable water management practices offers a comprehensive solution to address the complex challenges faced by these communities.
