# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

**Executive Summary**

Lower-income countries face significant environmental challenges, including inadequate access to clean drinking water, limited access to electricity, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. This brief provides an overview of the current state of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, highlighting key data points needed for effective policy planning. It also identifies areas where additional research or data collection is required.

**Section 1: Understanding Water Security Challenges**

Water security is a critical issue in lower-income countries, with significant implications for human health, economic development, and environmental sustainability. According to the World Bank (2019), approximately 2.3 billion people live without access to basic sanitation facilities, while 844 million people lack access to clean drinking water. To develop effective strategies for improving water security, it is essential to understand the current state of water resources in lower-income countries.

* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Population living with inadequate access to clean drinking water.
	+ Percentage of population without basic sanitation facilities.
* **Sources to Consult**:
	+ World Bank, "Water and Sanitation in Low-Income Countries"
	+ UNICEF, Annual Water Supply and Sanitation Statistics

**Section 2: Clean Energy Solutions for Lower-Income Countries**

Access to clean energy is fundamental for sustainable development, particularly in lower-income countries where energy poverty remains a significant challenge. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2020), approximately 1 billion people lack access to electricity globally. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, offer a promising solution to address energy poverty while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Proportion of population with access to electricity.
	+ Cost-effectiveness of renewable energy sources compared to fossil fuels.
* **Sources to Consult**:
	+ International Energy Agency (IEA), World Energy Outlook
	+ OECD, Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Clean Energy Fund

**Section 3: Climate Adaptation Strategies in Lower-Income Countries**

Climate change poses significant risks to lower-income countries, particularly small island developing states and least developed countries. Effective climate adaptation strategies are essential for reducing vulnerability to climate change impacts while promoting sustainable development.

* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.
	+ Percentage of GDP allocated towards climate resilience projects.
* **Sources to Consult**:
	+ World Bank, Climate Change Knowledge Portal
	+ UNDP, Human Development Reports

**Section 4: Financing for Environmental Resilience Initiatives**

Adequate funding is critical for implementing environmental resilience programs in lower-income countries. Official development assistance (ODA) and private sector investment play essential roles in supporting climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.

* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Amount of ODA directed towards climate change and environment.
	+ Private sector investment in green technologies and projects.
* **Sources to Consult**:
	+ OECD, Development Assistance Committee (DAC)
	+ World Bank, Annual ODA Statistics

**Section 5: Policy Frameworks for Environmental Resilience**

Robust policy frameworks are necessary to guide implementation of environmental resilience initiatives. Existing policies related to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation must be reviewed and strengthened to ensure their effectiveness.

* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Number and type of policies related to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.
	+ Compliance rates with existing environmental regulations.
* **Sources to Consult**:
	+ UN Environment Programme (UNEP), Global Environmental Outlook
	+ National Ministries of Environment in Lower-Income Countries

**Section 6: Community Engagement and Local Ownership**

Involving local communities is crucial for ensuring the sustainability and effectiveness of environmental resilience programs. Community-led initiatives must be supported, and participation rates in decision-making processes related to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation must be monitored.

* **Key Data Points Needed**:
	+ Percentage of community-led initiatives supported by government or international organizations.
	+ Levels of community participation in decision-making processes related to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.
* **Sources to Consult**:
	+ Local Ministries of Environment
	+ UNDP, Community-Based Adaptation (CBA) Initiatives

**Data Gaps Identification**

The following data gaps were identified:

* **Water Security**: Limited data on rural areas and informal settlements.
* **Clean Energy**: Lack of detailed cost-benefit analyses for various renewable energy sources in specific contexts.
* **Climate Adaptation**: Incomplete coverage of small island developing states and least developed countries (LDCs).
* **Financing**: Need for more disaggregated data to understand ODA allocation by country or region.
* **Policy Frameworks**: Limited information on the implementation status and effectiveness of existing policies in lower-income countries.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Strengthen policy frameworks related to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.
2. Increase funding for environmental resilience initiatives through official development assistance (ODA) and private sector investment.
3. Enhance community engagement and local ownership through community-led initiatives and participatory decision-making processes.
4. Address data gaps by conducting further research and collecting disaggregated data on water security, clean energy, climate adaptation, financing, and policy frameworks.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience is a critical issue in lower-income countries, requiring urgent attention from policymakers, international organizations, and local communities. This brief highlights the importance of understanding current challenges related to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation while identifying areas where additional research or data collection is required. By addressing these gaps and implementing effective strategies for environmental resilience, we can reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts, promote sustainable development, and improve human well-being in lower-income countries.
