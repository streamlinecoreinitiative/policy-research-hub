**Strengthening Environmental Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: Ensuring Water Security and Clean Energy**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, electricity access, and renewable energy consumption. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and 53.3% accessing electricity (World Bank Open Data), there is an urgent need for robust policy interventions to enhance resilience against climate change impacts. This brief outlines actionable steps to improve these critical services, focusing on accessible solutions that can be implemented within existing resources.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods (IPCC, 2020). The region's water security challenges are exacerbated by the fact that only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), compared to a global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data). Similarly, electricity access is notably lower in sub-Saharan Africa at 53.3%, significantly below the global average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data).

## Analysis

The statistics highlight significant gaps and underscore the need for urgent policy interventions to improve water security and clean energy access. For instance, renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7% of total final energy consumption globally (World Bank Open Data), indicating a pressing need to transition towards cleaner energy sources.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Community-Based Water Filtration Systems**: Invest in community-level filtration systems that use simple technologies such as sand filters. Provide training on maintenance and operation to ensure sustainability.
	* Cost estimates for community-based water filtration systems range from $50-$100 per household (World Bank Open Data).
2. **Solar-Powered Renewable Energy Infrastructure**: Integrate solar panels into existing infrastructure projects like schools and health centers to provide reliable electricity without grid connections.
	* Integration of solar-powered renewable energy infrastructure may require initial investment but can lead to long-term cost savings through reduced fuel costs and increased efficiency (World Bank Open Data).
3. **Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops**: Promote cash crop cultivation integrated with agroforestry practices that improve soil health and water retention. Encourage local processing to reduce transportation costs.
	* Agroforestry value chains can be supported by providing training on sustainable practices and offering incentives for participation (UN SDG Report 2023).

## Implementation Considerations

Implementation of these recommendations will require coordination among government agencies, development partners, and local communities. Cost estimates for community-based water filtration systems range from $50-$100 per household, with potential savings in healthcare due to improved sanitation.

## Conclusion

The urgent need for enhanced water security and clean energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa demands immediate action. By implementing the recommended policy interventions, governments and development partners can significantly improve the resilience of communities against climate change impacts. We must act now to ensure a brighter future for all affected regions.
