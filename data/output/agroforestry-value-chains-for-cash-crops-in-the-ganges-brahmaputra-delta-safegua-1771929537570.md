**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: A Resilient Path Forward for Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% access) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and reliable electricity (53.3% access) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. To address these issues, we recommend implementing community-based water projects, increasing renewable energy investments, and developing climate-resilient infrastructure. Immediate action is necessary to mitigate the adverse impacts of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change, which threaten public health, economic stability, and overall development.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries are disproportionately affected by water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts. Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in terms of access to safe drinking water (32.4% vs [VERIFY] 73.7%) and electricity (53.3% vs [VERIFY] 91.6%). These disparities are exacerbated by climate change, leading to more frequent droughts and floods. According to the World Bank Open Data, only [NEEDS SOURCE] of the world's renewable energy consumption is utilized, far below global targets.

## Analysis

Water scarcity affects agricultural productivity and household income. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). Energy poverty limits opportunities for economic growth and exacerbates health issues due to reliance on kerosene lamps or open fires for lighting and cooking. Climate change threatens food security by reducing crop yields and increasing variability in rainfall patterns leading to droughts and floods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Community-Based Water Projects**:
   - Increase funding for water point construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance.
   - Implement community-managed water systems that involve local residents in decision-making processes.

2. **Boost Renewable Energy Investments**:
   - Invest in solar power plants to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and improve energy access.
   - Support small-scale renewable energy projects like microgrids for rural clinics and community centers.

3. **Develop Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**:
   - Design infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves.
   - Promote climate-smart agriculture practices that are resistant to changing climatic conditions.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Funding**: Secure dedicated budgets from national governments and international donors for water security projects.
2. **Capacity Building**: Train local officials, community leaders, and technicians in sustainable water management techniques and renewable energy technologies.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve communities directly through participatory planning processes to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries must prioritize efforts to secure adequate water supplies, ensure reliable access to clean energy, and build climate resilience. By adopting these evidence-based strategies, stakeholders can significantly improve the lives of vulnerable populations while contributing to global environmental goals. We urge governments to allocate resources towards implementing community-led water projects and support renewable energy initiatives.
