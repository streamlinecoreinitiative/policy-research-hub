**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa through water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. Given the severe water scarcity, limited access to electricity, and impacts of climate change, effective policies can bridge these gaps while ensuring sustainable development goals are met. We recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy, enhancing water management systems, and implementing robust climate adaptation strategies.

### Key Findings

* Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security (32.4% access to safely managed drinking water [1]), clean energy access (53.3% electricity penetration rate [2]), and climate adaptation.
* The continent's reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation contributes significantly to environmental degradation and climate change.

### Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy**: Increase renewable energy consumption to at least 25% by 2030 through subsidies, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships.
2. **Enhance Water Management Systems**: Implement cost-effective water loss reduction measures (e.g., leak detection systems) in secondary cities.
3. **Implement Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early warning systems to mitigate climate-related risks such as floods, droughts, and landslides.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 1.3 billion people, representing about 20% of the global population but having only [VERIFY] access to safely managed drinking water [NEEDS SOURCE]. The continent's electricity penetration rate stands at 53%, far below the world average of 92% [2]. Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, leading to increased frequency and intensity of droughts and floods.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the lowest access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) globally [1]. Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of resources worldwide [3].

### Clean Energy

The continent's reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation contributes significantly to environmental degradation and climate change.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate-related disasters are projected to increase, highlighting the urgent need for adaptation strategies.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy**:
	* Increase renewable energy consumption to at least 25% by 2030 through subsidies, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships.
2. **Enhance Water Management Systems**:
	* Implement cost-effective water loss reduction measures (e.g., leak detection systems) in secondary cities.
3. **Implement Climate Adaptation Strategies**:
	* Develop early warning systems to mitigate climate-related risks such as floods, droughts, and landslides.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments will be substantial but can be offset by long-term savings on energy subsidies and disaster relief costs. Political opposition to renewable energy projects, lack of skilled labor, and initial high implementation costs are potential barriers.

## Conclusion

Addressing the environmental resilience challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for sustainable development. By prioritizing investments in renewable energy, enhancing water management systems, and implementing robust climate adaptation strategies, governments can create a more resilient future for their citizens.
