# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and water scarcity issues. Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains can support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This brief explores the potential for integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to address water security challenges in lower-income countries, specifically focusing on the Ethiopian Highlands.

**Climate-Resilient Irrigation Solutions: Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems**

### **Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt experiences erratic rainfall patterns, with average annual rainfall ranging from 800-1200 mm. Precipitation variability is significant, with an annual range of [verify] 600-1400 mm.

### **Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, contributing to poverty among smallholder farmers. Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems experience significant water loss due to evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%). The economic impact is substantial:

* Cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods: $100-$200/year

### **Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it more resilient to climate change impacts. Benefits of agroforestry include:

* Soil organic matter: [verify] 2-8%
* Biodiversity: [verify] 15-30% increase in native species
* Carbon sequestration: [verify] 3-7 tons/ha/year

Case studies from other regions (e.g., West Africa, East Africa) demonstrate successful implementation of agroforestry systems.

### **Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Specific data includes:

* Power generation: [verify] 10-50 kW per system
* Energy efficiency: [verify] 70-80%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

### **Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. Cost estimates and financial viability analysis are essential:

* Total project cost: $10,000-$25,000 per hectare
* Return on investment (ROI): [verify] 3-5 years

### **Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions. Future research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability:

* Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** that supports the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation solutions.
2. **Conduct further research** on long-term sustainability and economic viability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Establish partnerships** between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to facilitate the implementation of these innovative solutions.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains can play a vital role in supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance both water security and renewable energy use in lower-income countries. It is essential to develop a comprehensive policy framework, conduct further research, and establish partnerships to facilitate the adoption of these innovative solutions.
