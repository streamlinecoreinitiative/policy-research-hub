# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief outlines a critical pathway to bridge water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation gaps. We recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, leveraging community-based approaches to enhance water management and renewable energy use.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts. Limited access to safe drinking water hinders health outcomes and economic productivity [1]. Similarly, electricity access remains low, particularly in rural areas, which limits development opportunities [2].

## Analysis

Access to safe drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa is alarmingly low, with only 32.4% of the population having access [3]. This disparity compounds health risks and economic disparities. In contrast, electricity access stands at 53.3%, indicating significant room for improvement [4]. Renewable energy consumption remains stagnant at around 19.7% [5], far below global averages.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Enhanced Water Security**: Invest in infrastructure projects such as water supply systems (dams, wells) and sanitation facilities.

2. **Promoting Renewable Energy**: Increase government investment in renewable energy projects such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
	* Data: Renewable energy consumption (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2021): 19.7 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Implement early warning systems for climate-related disasters like droughts and floods.
4. **Community Engagement**: Empower local communities by providing training on sustainable water management and renewable energy use.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Secure dedicated budgets for these initiatives through national and international financing mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility, Green Climate Fund, and bilateral aid.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local governments and community leaders in water management and renewable energy technologies.

## Conclusion

Addressing the water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted effort from all stakeholders. By implementing evidence-based policies and engaging communities effectively, we can create a resilient future where sustainable development is within reach.
