# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Lower Mekong Delta: Enhancing Food Security During Droughts

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, with frequent droughts and water scarcity posing significant challenges to food security. This brief explores the potential for agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in stabilizing school feeding supply chains during droughts.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Delta

Climate change is exacerbating droughts and water scarcity in the Lower Mekong delta, impacting agricultural productivity and food security. The region's reliance on rain-fed agriculture makes it particularly vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns. NOAA climate data indicates a decline in rainfall over the past decade, with significant implications for crop yields and rural livelihoods.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Lower Mekong delta are often inefficient, leading to water loss through evaporation and seepage. Boreholes and canals are commonly used, but these methods have limited capacity to adapt to changing climate conditions. Water scarcity has severe economic consequences for farmers.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices offer a promising solution to the region's water management challenges. By integrating trees into farming systems, agroforestry enhances soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies have demonstrated that agroforestry improves water retention and reduces erosion.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a clean and efficient source of energy for irrigation. Small-scale hydroelectric power generation can reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency. This approach is particularly relevant in the Lower Mekong delta, where access to electricity is limited (World Bank: Access to Electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa).

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. These integrated approaches can provide a reliable source of clean energy and water, enhancing food security.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale:

1.  **Develop policy frameworks** that incentivize the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in irrigation management.
2.  **Invest in community engagement** to raise awareness about the benefits of these integrated approaches.
3.  **Conduct further research** on the economic impact, scalability, and social acceptability of these solutions.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Develop policy frameworks that incentivize the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in irrigation management.
2.  Invest in community engagement to raise awareness about the benefits of these integrated approaches.
3.  Conduct further research on the economic impact, scalability, and social acceptability of these solutions.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are critical for stabilizing food security during droughts in the Lower Mekong delta. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to the region's water management challenges, enhancing climate resilience while contributing to economic stability and poverty reduction. Further research is needed to fully explore its benefits.
