# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sahel: raising resilience finance for communities

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. Despite progress in some areas, vast regions remain without basic drinking water facilities, and the region struggles with renewable energy consumption, exacerbating its vulnerability to climate change impacts. To address these gaps, we recommend prioritizing investments in resilient water supply systems, expanding access to electricity, and increasing adoption of renewable energy sources.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately affected by climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, which strain already limited water resources [1]. The region's development trajectories hinge on overcoming these challenges to ensure economic stability and social well-being for its growing population. Despite significant progress in some areas, vast regions remain without basic drinking water facilities [2]. The region's vulnerability to climate change impacts is further exacerbated by low renewable energy consumption [3].

### Analysis

The statistics paint a stark picture:

* Access to safely managed drinking water: 74% globally, but only 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa [1]
* Renewable energy consumption: 19.7% globally, but only 9.2% in Sub-Saharan Africa [3] (Note: This appears to be an error, as the global average is higher than the regional average)
* Global population lacking safe water: 2.2 billion people [4]

These challenges are further compounded by limited financial resources, weak institutional capacity, and inadequate investment in water infrastructure and renewable energy technologies.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Integrate resilience into national development plans**: Ensure that climate adaptation measures are integrated with economic growth strategies to promote equitable access and sustainability.
2. **Invest in clean cooking solutions**: Develop and deploy affordable, efficient, and sustainable cookstoves for rural households to reduce reliance on biomass fuels and mitigate indoor air pollution.
3. **Enhance renewable energy deployment**: Prioritize solar, wind, and hydro projects to reduce carbon emissions and diversify power sources, with a focus on community-based initiatives to promote local ownership and sustainability.
4. **Strengthen water management systems**: Implement community-managed water supply systems and improve sanitation facilities to ensure equitable access to safe drinking water.

### Implementation Considerations

The costs associated with these initiatives are substantial but can be funded through grants, concessional loans, and international aid. Potential barriers include limited financial resources, bureaucratic delays, and resistance to change among local communities and stakeholders. Addressing these obstacles will require robust planning, stakeholder engagement, and capacity building.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's development trajectory hinges on addressing the critical gaps in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. We urge governments, NGOs, and development partners to collaborate to implement the recommended policies to improve water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. Next steps include conducting detailed feasibility studies, securing funding through innovative financing mechanisms, and monitoring progress with regular data collection and reporting.
