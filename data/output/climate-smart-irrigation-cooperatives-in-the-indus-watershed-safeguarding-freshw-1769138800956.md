**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Indus Watershed: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the region's population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], and just 53.3% accessing electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)], these issues threaten both economic stability and public health. To address this challenge, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Indus watershed, which can provide reliable and sustainable access to clean water and energy while promoting climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. The region's limited resources for clean energy and inadequate access to basic services exacerbate existing challenges. According to World Bank data [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water, while just 53.3% have access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)]. Furthermore, the region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts.

## Analysis

### Water Security

The lack of safe drinking water remains a significant challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa, affecting over 80 million people [Source: UN-Water/WHO]. The region's freshwater resources are under stress due to increasing demand and climate change impacts. [VERIFY] the exact number of people affected by lack of access to safe drinking water.

### Clean Energy Access

Only half the population has access to electricity, with renewable energy consumption at just 19.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)].

### Climate Adaptation

Vulnerability to climate change impacts is high; current levels of resilience are insufficient.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Establishing Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Implement microgrid systems powered by renewable energy sources in rural areas, focusing on the Indus watershed.
2. **Renewable Energy Integration**: Increase the share of renewables in total final energy consumption through projects like solar farms and small hydro plants.
3. **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant buildings and drought-tolerant crops.

## Implementation Considerations

* Initial investments for microgrids and renewable energy projects can be substantial but yield long-term benefits in terms of economic growth and sustainability.
* Political resistance, limited funding, and technical expertise may hinder implementation. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities is crucial to overcome these obstacles.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is imperative for Sub-Saharan Africa's sustainable development. By adopting targeted policies like microgrids, renewable integration, and resilient infrastructure, decision-makers can drive meaningful progress toward achieving SDG 6 (water), SDG 7 (energy), and SDG 13 (climate action) targets.

## Next Steps

Collaborative efforts between governments, international organizations, and the private sector are essential for successful implementation. Regular monitoring and evaluation should be conducted to ensure progress toward goals.
