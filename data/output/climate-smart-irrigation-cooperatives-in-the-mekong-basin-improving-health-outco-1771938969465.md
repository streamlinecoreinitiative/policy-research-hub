# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Enhancing Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary
To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin. These cooperatives will improve health outcomes during heatwaves by providing safe drinking water, promoting clean energy adoption, and bolstering climate adaptation strategies.

## Context & Challenge
Lower-income countries face significant challenges related to water security and clean energy access. According to the World Bank Open Data [1], only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water [NEEDS SOURCE]. This stark disparity underscores the urgency of improving water security in this region. Furthermore, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions with 53.3% electricity coverage [2], highlighting significant gaps in clean energy access.

Climate change exacerbates these challenges by reducing water availability, disrupting energy supply chains, and increasing the vulnerability of communities. The global population lacking safe drinking water is estimated at 2.2 billion people [3]. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1].

## Analysis
The current state of water security and clean energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by stark disparities. While significant progress has been made globally (91.6% electricity coverage worldwide) [2], regions like Sub-Saharan Africa still face considerable challenges. Climate change impacts, such as increased frequency of droughts and floods, further complicate these challenges.

- **Access to electricity (%) - World**: 91.6 [Source: World Bank Open Data]

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Implement large-scale rainwater harvesting projects, such as rainwater harvesting ponds, in areas with high rainfall variability to ensure sustainable replenishment of groundwater resources.
	* Rainwater harvesting can provide up to [VERIFY] % of daily domestic water needs [4].
2. **Promote Clean Energy Adoption**: Invest in decentralized renewable energy systems like solar-powered wells, which can provide drinking water to up to 500 households per site [5].
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Integrate climate-resilient infrastructure into new developments, including incorporating cool roofs and green spaces in urban areas to mitigate urban heat islands.

## Implementation Considerations
Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning and coordination. Key considerations include:
- **Financial Support**: Securing funding from international development partners, national governments, and local communities.
- **Technical Capacity Building**: Training community members in maintenance and operation of renewable energy systems.

## Conclusion
By focusing on enhancing water security through large-scale rainwater harvesting projects and promoting clean energy access via solar-powered wells, Sub-Saharan Africa can significantly reduce its vulnerability to environmental shocks. Concurrently, integrating climate adaptation measures will help communities build resilience against future climatic changes. These interventions are not only feasible but also cost-effective when implemented with proper planning and support.
