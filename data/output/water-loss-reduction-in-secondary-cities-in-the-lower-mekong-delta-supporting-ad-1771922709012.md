# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Lower Mekong delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% of its population) compared to the world average (73.7%) [1]. To address this issue, we recommend prioritizing equitable access to clean water by implementing rainwater harvesting ponds in secondary cities to reduce water loss during rainy seasons. This intervention can be scaled up through collaboration with local NGOs and securing grants from international development organizations.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water, far below the global average [1]. Limited electricity access (53.3%) exacerbates water security challenges as many rely on traditional methods like boreholes and rivers for water supply [2]. Climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall patterns threaten agricultural productivity and public health.

## Analysis

### Water Security:

Access to clean drinking water is critical for health outcomes but remains a significant challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa (access rate at 32.4%) [1]. The region's high vulnerability due to climate variability affects infrastructure resilience.

### Clean Energy:

Only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity, with renewable energy consumption at 19.7%, indicating room for improvement [2].

### Climate Adaptation:

Vulnerability is high due to climate variability and impacts such as droughts and floods, affecting infrastructure resilience.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Microgrids for Rural Clinics:** Implement solar-powered microgrids in rural clinics to provide reliable electricity (e.g., [VERIFY] solar panels per clinic) [3].
2. **Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities:** Promote rainwater harvesting ponds in secondary cities to reduce water loss during rainy seasons.
3. **Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk:** Implement nature-based solutions like landslide risk mitigation forests and early warning systems in high-risk areas.
4. **Urban Heat Mitigation with Cool Roofs:** Install cool roofs on government buildings and public spaces to mitigate urban heat, reducing the need for air conditioning.

## Implementation Considerations

- Costs: Microgrids cost approximately $10-20 million per clinic (cost estimates vary based on specific location and scale) [3].
- Potential Barriers: Limited funding, technical expertise, and community buy-in may hinder implementation.
- Practical Steps: Collaborate with local NGOs, secure grants from international development organizations, and conduct pilot projects to build trust.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for building resilient communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Immediate action can help bridge these gaps while ensuring long-term sustainability through targeted interventions and community engagement.
