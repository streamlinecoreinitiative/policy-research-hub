# ** Harnessing Biodiverse Terraces for Climate-Resilient Agriculture in the Andean Region

**Harnessing Biodiverse Terraces for Climate-Resilient Agriculture in the Andean Region**

**Executive Summary:**
The Andean region is characterized by significant climate variability, posing substantial challenges to agricultural productivity and food security for millions of smallholder farmers. This brief highlights the potential of biodiverse terracing as a solution to enhance soil health, reduce erosion, and increase water retention. By integrating biodiverse terracing with climate-resilient agriculture practices, this intervention can improve the sustainability and resilience of critical livelihoods in the region.

**Climate Variability in Andean Agriculture: An Overview**

The Andean region is prone to extreme climate events such as droughts, floods, and frost, which have significant impacts on agricultural productivity. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns threaten crop yields, food security, and rural livelihoods (FAO, 2018). Smallholder farmers in the region often lack access to resources, information, and support services necessary for adapting to climate change (World Bank, 2020).

**Biodiverse Terracing as a Solution**

Biodiverse terracing is an agroecological approach that involves creating terraces with diverse plant species to improve soil structure, water retention, and biodiversity. This technique can help mitigate the effects of climate variability by:

• Enhancing soil health through improved organic matter content and reduced erosion
• Increasing water retention and reducing runoff through better infiltration rates
• Promoting biodiversity through diverse plant species that provide ecosystem services

Successful implementation of biodiverse terracing has been documented in various case studies from the Andean region (see section 3). These examples demonstrate the potential for increased crop yields, improved soil health, and enhanced resilience to climate-related shocks.

**Evidence from Case Studies in the Andes**

Several case studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of biodiverse terracing in improving agricultural productivity and enhancing climate resilience. For example:

• A study in Peru showed that biodiverse terracing increased maize yields by 25% compared to traditional farming methods (INEI, 2019)
• In Bolivia, a project implemented biodiverse terraces with diverse plant species, resulting in improved soil health and reduced erosion (World Bank, 2020)

**Economic Benefits for Farmers**

The economic benefits of biodiverse terracing are significant. By reducing erosion and improving water retention, farmers can save on inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. Additionally, biodiverse terracing can increase income generation opportunities through:

• Improved crop yields and market access
• Reduced costs associated with soil degradation and climate-related shocks

A cost-benefit analysis is needed to compare traditional farming methods versus biodiverse terracing practices (see data gaps).

**Policy Recommendations for Scale-Up**

To promote the adoption of biodiverse terracing among smallholder farmers, government bodies can:

• Provide policy support measures such as subsidies, incentives, and training programs
• Develop and implement climate-resilient agriculture policies that prioritize agroecological approaches like biodiverse terracing
• Establish partnerships with international organizations to access technical expertise and funding

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct further research on long-term impacts of biodiverse terracing on soil health and biodiversity.
2. Perform a cost-benefit analysis comparing traditional farming methods versus biodiverse terracing practices.
3. Develop policy support measures for government bodies to promote adoption of biodiverse terracing among smallholder farmers.

**Closing Outlook:**
Harnessing biodiverse terraces for climate-resilient agriculture in the Andean region has significant potential for improving agricultural productivity, enhancing food security, and promoting sustainable livelihoods. Further research and investment are needed to scale up this intervention and support the resilience of smallholder farmers in the face of climate variability.
