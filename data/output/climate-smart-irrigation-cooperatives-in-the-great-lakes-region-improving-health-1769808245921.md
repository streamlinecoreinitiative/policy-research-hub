# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Path to Resilient Development**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives. This approach can improve health outcomes during heatwaves by providing safe drinking water and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. Specifically, we propose:

1. **Increase investment in water infrastructure projects**: Allocate $50 million to $100 million per project to enhance access to safely managed drinking water.
2. **Implement community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs**: Engage communities in improving sanitation facilities and hygiene practices to reduce diarrheal diseases.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Renewable energy consumption stands at only 9.2%, far below the world's average (19.7%) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. These statistics underscore pressing needs for improved infrastructure and policy support.

## Analysis

The limited access to safe drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa is exacerbated by inadequate sanitation facilities, leading to widespread health issues such as diarrheal diseases. For instance, 40% of households lack basic sanitation services [Source: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program]. Additionally, the region's renewable energy consumption remains stagnant.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
	* Increase investment in water infrastructure projects.
	* Implement community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs to improve sanitation facilities and hygiene practices.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Adoption**:
	* Invest in solar-powered desalination plants for coastal communities without reliable freshwater sources.
	* Expand micro-grids to rural areas with high solar irradiation potential.
3. **Implement Climate-Resilient Agricultural Practices**:
	* Promote climate-smart agriculture practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties, improved irrigation systems, and agroforestry value chains for cash crops.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Feasibility**: The recommended interventions are feasible given existing resources.
2. **Costs**: Initial costs for these programs may range from $50 million to $100 million per project, depending on scale and complexity [VERIFY].
3. **Barriers**: Potential barriers include limited financial resources, political will, and community engagement.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for fostering sustainable development. By implementing evidence-based policies and strategies outlined above, governments can significantly improve the region's resilience and quality of life. Collaboration between stakeholders—including government officials, NGOs, and international organizations—is essential to ensure these interventions are effective and inclusive.
