# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Andean highlands: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Andean Highlands: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**
The Andean highlands are among the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent droughts and floods posing significant threats to local communities. To mitigate these risks, we recommend implementing watershed co-management initiatives with indigenous councils as key stakeholders. This approach can help reduce disaster losses by promoting sustainable water management practices, increasing community resilience, and enhancing adaptive capacity.

**Context & Challenge**
The Andean highlands are characterized by fragile ecosystems and limited access to basic services such as electricity [VERIFY] (53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to electricity, World Bank, 2024) and safely managed drinking water [NEEDS SOURCE]. Climate change is exacerbating these challenges, with increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events. For instance, droughts in the region can lead to crop failures, affecting food security and livelihoods.

**Analysis**
Recent studies have highlighted the importance of community-based approaches in managing natural resources (World Wildlife Fund, 2022). In the context of watershed co-management, indigenous councils can play a crucial role in promoting sustainable practices and enhancing adaptive capacity. For example, a study on water management in the Andean region found that community-led initiatives resulted in improved water quality and increased crop yields [NEEDS SOURCE].

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Establish Watershed Co-Management Committees**
   - Collaborate with indigenous councils to establish watershed co-management committees.
   - Ensure these committees have a clear mandate, authority, and resources to manage watersheds effectively.

2. **Promote Sustainable Water Practices**
   - Implement water efficiency measures in agriculture and industry.
   - Promote rainwater harvesting and small-scale irrigation systems.

3. **Enhance Community Resilience**
   - Develop early warning systems for climate-related events such as droughts and floods.
   - Provide training on disaster preparedness, infrastructure upgrades in vulnerable areas, and insurance schemes.

**Implementation Considerations**

- Practical steps: Engage local communities in planning processes; leverage existing institutions like NGOs and traditional leaders for outreach and support.
- Costs: Estimate initial investments required for watershed co-management initiatives (e.g., community engagement, capacity building).
- Potential barriers: Address issues related to funding availability, technical expertise, regulatory frameworks, and public acceptance.

**Conclusion**
Watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Andean highlands is a critical strategy for reducing disaster losses among vulnerable groups. By promoting sustainable water practices, enhancing community resilience, and adapting to climate change, we can ensure more equitable access to natural resources and improve the lives of local communities.
