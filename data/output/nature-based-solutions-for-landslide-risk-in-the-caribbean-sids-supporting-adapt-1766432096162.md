**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Caribbean SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change exacerbates landslide risk in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Caribbean, threatening livelihoods and ecosystems. This brief argues that nature-based solutions can support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We focus on integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to provide a sustainable solution for water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

**Section 1: Introduction to Environmental Resilience in the Caribbean SIDS**

The Caribbean SIDS are highly susceptible to climate-related hazards, including landslides. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns intensify landslide risk, impacting agriculture, infrastructure, and human settlements. Climate change projections indicate an increase in extreme weather events by 2050 (IPCC, [verify]). This brief highlights the need for nature-based solutions to support adaptation targets in NDCs.

**Section 2: Current Environmental Challenges in the Caribbean SIDS**

*   **Water Scarcity:** Average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm.
*   **Energy Access:** Traditional irrigation systems consume energy, while canal systems lose water due to evaporation and seepage.
*   **Economic Burden:** Cost per hectare for traditional methods is $100-$200.

**Section 3: Nature-Based Solutions for Environmental Resilience**

*   **Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience:** Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
    *   Specific benefits of agroforestry:
        Soil organic matter increases by [verify]%
        Biodiversity increase by [verify] native species
        Carbon sequestration by [verify] tons/ha/year
*   **Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency:** Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy.
    *   Specific data:
        Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system
        Energy efficiency is at 70-80%
        Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

**Section 4: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

*   **Cost Estimates and Financial Viability Analysis:** Total project cost per hectare is $10,000-$25,000.
    *   Return on investment (ROI) is [verify] years
    *   Long-term sustainability assessments

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Integrate Agroforestry with Micro-Hydro Systems:** Promote integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects to provide cost-effective solutions for water security and clean energy.
2.  **Support Policy Measures:** Encourage incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans), grid integration with micro-hydro systems, and infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities).
3.  **Future Research Directions:** Conduct economic impact assessments, community acceptance studies, and long-term sustainability evaluations to inform policy decisions.

**Closing Outlook**

Nature-based solutions can support adaptation targets in NDCs by providing a sustainable solution for water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a cost-effective approach to addressing environmental challenges in the Caribbean SIDS. By promoting these nature-based solutions, we can enhance the resilience of ecosystems and communities.

**Needed Evidence:**

1.  **Climate Data:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Caribbean SIDS (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2.  **Economic Analysis:** Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3.  **Socioeconomic Studies:** Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

This brief provides a comprehensive overview of the environmental challenges in the Caribbean SIDS, the potential of nature-based solutions, and the necessary evidence to support policy decisions. By promoting integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects, we can enhance the resilience of ecosystems and communities.
