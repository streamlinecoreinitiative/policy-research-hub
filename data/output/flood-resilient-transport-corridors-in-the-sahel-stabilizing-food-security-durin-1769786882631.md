# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Sahel: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $1 billion over the next 5 years to enhance large-scale water storage facilities, promote renewable energy sources, and develop early warning systems for extreme weather events. This investment will improve access to safely managed drinking water from [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data, 2024) to at least 85%, increase electricity access from [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data, 2023) to 95%, and reduce the vulnerability of communities to climate-related disasters.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally due to its reliance on natural resources, particularly water and electricity, which are essential for economic growth. Only [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data, 2024) of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, leaving millions without reliable sources. Similarly, less than [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data, 2023) have access to electricity. These statistics underscore a pressing need for substantial improvements in infrastructure and resource management.

Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing the frequency of droughts and floods, leading to water scarcity and power outages. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6) reports that global temperatures have risen by [VERIFY] since pre-industrial times, affecting ecosystems and human settlements across Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Analysis

The region's reliance on natural resources is compounded by inadequate investments in water management systems and clean energy solutions. For instance, only 74% of the world population has access to safely managed drinking water (UN SDG Report 2023), indicating significant gaps in coverage. Sub-Saharan Africa faces substantial climate-related risks such as frequent droughts and floods, which not only disrupt agricultural productivity but also exacerbate energy supply issues.

To address these challenges effectively, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. This includes investing in robust water management systems, developing sustainable clean energy sources, and enhancing adaptive capacities through early warning systems and resilient infrastructure design.

### Policy Recommendations

1.  **Enhance Water Security:** Invest $200 million over the next 3 years to develop large-scale water storage facilities like dams and reservoirs to ensure steady water supplies during dry periods. Implement rainwater harvesting systems and promote efficient irrigation practices using drip or sprinkler systems.
2.  **Promote Renewable Energy Access:** Allocate $300 million over the next 5 years to increase access to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power through subsidies for installation and maintenance of clean energy technologies. Encourage public-private partnerships (PPPs) for large-scale projects like mini-grids in rural areas.
3.  **Climate Resilience Initiatives:** Invest $500 million over the next 5 years to develop early warning systems for extreme weather events using satellite data and local observations. Build climate-resilient infrastructure such as flood barriers, sea walls, and drought-resistant crops.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires substantial financial commitment and coordination among various stakeholders including governments, international organizations, NGOs, and the private sector. Funding gaps can be addressed through innovative financing mechanisms like green bonds or carbon credits. Collaboration with local communities is vital to ensure that projects are sustainable and meet their needs.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges to foster resilient economies and societies. By implementing the recommended policies, stakeholders can significantly improve living conditions and promote long-term development in the region. Collaboration across sectors is essential for effective implementation of these strategies.
