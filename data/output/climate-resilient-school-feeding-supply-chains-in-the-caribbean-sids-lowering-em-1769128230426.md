**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Caribbean SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity, limited access to clean energy, and climate-induced shocks. To address these issues, we recommend implementing policies for improved water security, enhancing clean energy access, and promoting climate adaptation strategies in the region's school feeding supply chains. By doing so, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from critical sectors, improve living standards, and bolster regional economic resilience.

**Key Findings:**

* Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data).
* The region's renewable energy consumption is low at 19.7%, with over 2 billion people lacking access to safe water globally (UN-Water/WHO).

**Recommendations:**

1. Implement policies for improved water security, including sustainable water supply systems and community-based management programs.
2. Enhance clean energy access through subsidies, grants, and public-private partnerships for renewable energy sources like solar photovoltaic (PV) and biogas.
3. Promote climate adaptation strategies, such as early warning systems, flood-resistant infrastructure, and drought-tolerant crop varieties.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with severe water scarcity, poor energy access, and climate-induced shocks. The region's water security issues stem from inadequate infrastructure, poor governance, and limited financial resources (UN-Water/WHO). Only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas (World Bank Open Data).

**Access to Safely Managed Drinking Water:**

* Sub-Saharan Africa: 32.4% (2024) [1]
* World: 73.7% (2024) [2]

**Renewable Energy Consumption:**

* World: 19.7% (2020) [3]
* Sub-Saharan Africa: 19.7% (2020) [3]

## Analysis

The region's water security issues are exacerbated by climate change impacts, such as droughts and floods, leading to food insecurity and economic instability. The lack of access to clean energy limits options for sustainable power generation, while the reliance on fossil fuels contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

**Climate Change Impacts:**

* Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns affect water availability and quality.
* Frequent droughts and floods disrupt agricultural productivity and food security.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security:** Invest in sustainable water supply systems, such as rainwater harvesting and solar-powered wells. Implement community-based management programs for watershed protection and maintenance.
2. **Clean Energy Access:** Promote the use of renewable energy sources like solar PV and biogas through subsidies, grants, and public-private partnerships. Establish micro-grids and off-grid solutions to ensure access in remote areas.
3. **Climate Adaptation:** Develop early warning systems for climate events, build flood-resistant infrastructure, and promote drought-tolerant crop varieties.

## Implementation Considerations

* Estimated total investment required: [VERIFY] (no source provided)
* Limited government funding, technical expertise, and regulatory frameworks for clean energy projects can be addressed through targeted grants, training programs, and policy reforms.
* Collaboration with local communities, NGOs, private sector entities, and international organizations is crucial to leverage resources effectively.

## Conclusion

Enhancing environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for sustainable development and poverty reduction. By prioritizing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation strategies, the region can build a more resilient future while meeting its development goals.
