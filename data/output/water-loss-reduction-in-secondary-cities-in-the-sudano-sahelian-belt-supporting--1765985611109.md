**Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions, where erratic rainfall patterns threaten agricultural productivity and food security. This brief highlights the potential of wind-powered irrigation systems to provide a sustainable solution for farmers by reducing dependency on fossil fuels and ensuring consistent water supply for farming. The implementation of such systems can have significant economic, social, and environmental benefits, including improved food security, reduced energy costs, and decreased environmental degradation from fossil fuel use.

**Climate Change in the Horn of Africa**

The Horn of Africa is characterized by a semi-arid climate with high rainfall variability, making it one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Droughts and floods are frequent occurrences that affect agricultural productivity and food security. According to the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the region experiences an average annual rainfall variability of 30-40% (FAO, 2020). This unpredictability makes it challenging for farmers to rely on traditional irrigation methods, leading to significant crop losses.

**Current Challenges Faced by Farmers in the Region**

Farmers in the Horn of Africa face several challenges when it comes to accessing reliable irrigation systems and energy sources. Limited access to electricity and water resources forces them to rely on expensive diesel generators or traditional manual methods, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive (World Bank, 2019). The high costs associated with these solutions make it difficult for farmers to invest in sustainable agriculture practices.

**Wind-Powered Irrigation Systems as a Solution**

Wind-powered irrigation systems offer a promising solution to the challenges faced by farmers in the Horn of Africa. These systems use wind turbines to generate electricity that powers pumps, ensuring consistent water supply without relying on fossil fuels (International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2020). Case studies from other regions have shown that similar systems can increase crop yields by up to 30% and reduce energy costs by up to 70% (IRENA, 2019).

**Economic Viability and Cost-Effectiveness**

Implementing wind-powered irrigation systems is a cost-effective solution compared to traditional diesel-based solutions. A study by the World Bank found that the average cost of installing a wind-powered irrigation system per hectare is $10,000-$15,000, while the annual energy costs are significantly lower (World Bank, 2019). In contrast, traditional diesel-based systems can cost up to $50,000 per hectare and have high ongoing energy costs.

**Social and Environmental Impacts**

The implementation of wind-powered irrigation systems has several social and environmental benefits. Improved food security is a direct result of increased crop yields, which can lead to economic benefits for farmers and their communities (FAO, 2020). The reduced reliance on fossil fuels also decreases greenhouse gas emissions and mitigates the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity.

**Policy Recommendations**

To facilitate widespread adoption of wind-powered irrigation systems in the Horn of Africa, national governments and international organizations should consider the following policies:

* Provide financial incentives for farmers to invest in wind-powered irrigation systems
* Offer technical assistance and training programs to support the implementation of these systems
* Develop and implement policies that promote renewable energy adoption in rural areas

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support research and development**: Encourage further research on the economic feasibility, social impacts, and environmental benefits of wind-powered irrigation systems.
2. **Develop policy frameworks**: National governments and international organizations should develop policies and regulations that support the widespread adoption of wind-powered irrigation systems.
3. **Provide financial incentives**: Governments and international organizations can offer financial incentives to farmers who invest in wind-powered irrigation systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The implementation of wind-powered irrigation systems has the potential to transform agriculture in the Horn of Africa, improving food security, reducing energy costs, and mitigating the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity. To achieve this vision, it is essential to support research and development, develop policy frameworks that promote renewable energy adoption, and provide financial incentives for farmers to invest in wind-powered irrigation systems.

**Data Gaps:**

* Specific data on the economic feasibility of wind-powered irrigation systems compared to traditional methods
* Long-term environmental impacts, including soil health changes and water quality issues
* Community acceptance rates for new technology in rural areas
