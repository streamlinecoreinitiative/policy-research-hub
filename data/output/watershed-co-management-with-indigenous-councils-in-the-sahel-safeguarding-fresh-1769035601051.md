# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sahel: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Ensuring Accessible Clean Water, Sustainable Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Improving access to clean water, sustainable energy, and climate resilience is critical for Sub-Saharan Africa's sustainable development goals (SDGs). The region faces significant challenges with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. Similarly, only 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity, with 91.6% worldwide [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)]. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in water infrastructure, renewable energy projects, and climate adaptation measures.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall patterns. These challenges exacerbate existing issues like water scarcity, poor sanitation, and limited access to electricity. Without significant improvements in these areas, the region will struggle to meet its SDG targets, particularly those related to water (SDG 6) and energy (SDG 7). The global population lacking safe water is estimated at [VERIFY] 2.2 billion people [Source: UN-Water/WHO (2022)], highlighting the need for urgent action.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water, with 70.1% relying on unimproved sources like rivers or unprotected wells [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. This disparity is a major public health concern and impedes economic development.

### Clean Energy

Access to electricity remains abysmally low at 53.3%, with renewable energy consumption accounting for only 19.7% of total final energy consumption globally [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)]. Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the lowest rates of access to clean and sustainable energy sources.

### Climate Adaptation

The region experiences frequent droughts and floods, affecting agriculture productivity and water resources management. Climate resilience strategies are essential for mitigating these impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**:
	* Invest in construction and rehabilitation of existing water supply systems to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Promote rainwater harvesting projects and desalination plants where feasible, especially in coastal areas with limited freshwater resources [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)].
2. **Accelerate Renewable Energy Deployment**:
	* Increase financial support for renewable energy projects such as solar power, wind turbines, and hydropower dams.
	* Encourage private sector investments through subsidies and tax incentives to reduce project costs and increase efficiency [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)].
3. **Climate Resilience Measures**:
	* Implement early warning systems for climate events like floods and droughts to aid in timely interventions.
	* Promote the use of drought-resistant crops and implement water-saving irrigation techniques to enhance agricultural productivity under changing climatic conditions [Source: FAO (2024)].

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in infrastructure development are substantial but can be offset by long-term benefits such as improved health outcomes and economic growth. High initial costs, lack of technical expertise, political instability, and limited access to financing are potential obstacles. Addressing these through targeted policies and international support can accelerate progress.

## Conclusion

Improving access to clean water, sustainable energy, and climate resilience is critical for Sub-Saharan Africa's sustainable development goals (SDGs). We urge governments, NGOs, and development partners to take immediate action to address these issues. Collaboration across sectors is essential to leverage resources effectively and ensure sustainable outcomes.
