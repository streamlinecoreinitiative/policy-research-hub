# early-warning systems and last-mile alerts in the Mekong basin: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1] and over half lacking electricity (World Bank, 2023), addressing these challenges is not just a humanitarian necessity but also an economic imperative for sustainable development in the region. To improve health outcomes, economic stability, and resilience, we recommend prioritizing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation projects.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is severely challenged by inadequate infrastructure for water supply and energy generation, compounded by increasing climate variability leading to more frequent droughts and floods (World Bank Open Data). Immediate action is crucial as these challenges threaten regional development goals and public health, necessitating integrated policy responses. For instance, droughts reduce groundwater recharge and river flows, while floods increase waterborne diseases and damage infrastructure.

## Analysis

Despite global efforts, progress towards SDG 6 (water) remains suboptimal at only 74% coverage worldwide, with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging significantly behind (UN SDG Report 2023). Climate impact is evident in extreme weather events that have intensified in recent years, impacting water availability and energy production. For example, droughts reduce freshwater withdrawal by [VERIFY] 9.2% of global resources (World Bank Open Data), while floods increase the risk of waterborne diseases.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security**: Implement sustainable water management practices such as rainwater harvesting and small-scale irrigation systems (World Bank data). Invest in desalination plants where feasible.
2. **Clean Energy Access**: Accelerate the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Provide subsidies or grants for households and businesses to adopt clean cooking stoves and improve grid reliability through microgrids.
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Build early warning systems for climate events; enhance water storage facilities (dams, reservoirs) that can store excess water during rainy seasons. Promote drought-resistant crops in agriculture.

## Implementation Considerations

1. Develop and fund national-level plans with clear milestones and timelines, involving all relevant stakeholders including the private sector.
2. Estimate initial investment costs for infrastructure development (rainwater harvesting systems, solar panels) and ongoing operational expenses (microgrids). Identify potential funding sources such as international aid, grants, and local government resources.
3. Address concerns around ownership rights over water bodies and energy assets. Ensure equitable distribution of benefits to marginalized communities.

## Conclusion

Governments should prioritize these interventions by setting ambitious targets aligned with national development plans and utilizing existing platforms for coordination such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and African Union initiatives. Next steps include establishing dedicated task forces, allocating sufficient budget, and engaging civil society organizations for sustained implementation.
