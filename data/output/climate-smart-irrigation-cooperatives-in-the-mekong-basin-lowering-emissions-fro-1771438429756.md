# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**
To enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend implementing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin to lower emissions from critical sectors. This policy approach prioritizes sustainable water supply, renewable energy development, and climate adaptation measures. By investing in water harvesting systems, desalination plants, and micro-irrigation projects, we can improve access to clean drinking water for [VERIFY] % of Sub-Saharan Africa's population who currently lack safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). Additionally, expanding solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation capacity in rural areas will increase electricity access rates from the current [NEEDS SOURCE] %. Implementing early warning systems for droughts and floods, developing climate-resilient agricultural practices, and supporting smallholder farmers with insurance schemes will further enhance climate resilience.

**Context & Challenge**
Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in providing safe drinking water, reliable energy access, and climate resilience to its populations. The region's arid conditions and high rainfall variability make access to clean water a significant challenge (World Bank, 2024). Climate change impacts are becoming more pronounced, with increased frequency of droughts and heatwaves threatening water security and energy generation (IPCC AR6).

**Analysis**
Evidence on water security shows that only [NEEDS SOURCE] % of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), compared to the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data). Climate change-induced extreme weather events reduce hydroelectric power generation, leading to a decline in electricity access rates from 91.6% globally (World Bank Open Data) to [NEEDS SOURCE] % in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2023).

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Increase Investment in Water Supply Infrastructure**
	* Invest in water harvesting systems, desalination plants, and micro-irrigation projects to improve access to clean drinking water.
	* Sources: UN-Water/WHO (2022); World Bank Open Data; IPCC AR6
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Development**
	* Expand solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation capacity in rural areas where electricity access is lowest.
	* Sources: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); World Bank Open Data
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Measures**
	* Implement early warning systems for droughts and floods, develop climate-resilient agricultural practices, and support smallholder farmers with insurance schemes.
	* Sources: World Bank Open Data; UN SDG Report 2023

**Implementation Considerations**
Estimated costs for water infrastructure projects range from $1-$5 billion per year (World Bank, 2024). Renewable energy development requires significant upfront investments but offers long-term benefits. Potential barriers to implementation include political instability, inadequate funding mechanisms, and limited technical expertise.

**Conclusion**
Addressing water security, clean energy, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is critical for fostering sustainable growth. Decision-makers must prioritize investment in infrastructure, renewable energy development, and climate adaptation measures to build a more resilient future for the region's populations.
