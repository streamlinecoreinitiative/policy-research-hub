# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Caribbean SIDS: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in Caribbean SIDS: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, including landslides and heatwaves. Traditional infrastructure development approaches often exacerbate these risks, while nature-based solutions offer a more sustainable path forward.

**Climate Change Impacts on Water Scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor**

The Central America Dry Corridor is a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change. Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from wetlands have led to reduced crop yields and economic instability for smallholder farmers. Climate projections indicate that these conditions will worsen.

* **Climate Change Impacts:**
	+ Rising temperatures increase water demand for agriculture.
	+ Shifts in precipitation patterns lead to droughts and floods.
	+ Increased evaporation from wetlands exacerbates water scarcity.
* **Importance of Resilient Irrigation Methods:**
	+ Ensure food security and economic stability for smallholder farmers.
	+ Protect against climate-related disasters such as landslides and heatwaves.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution to water scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor. Agroforestry benefits include improved soil health, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration.

* **Agroforestry Benefits:**
	+ Enhance soil fertility and structure.
	+ Increase water retention and reduce erosion.
	+ Support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services.
* **Micro-Hydro Systems:**
	+ Reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency.
	+ Generate renewable energy for irrigation and other community needs.

**Pilot Projects and Policy Recommendations**

Several pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. These initiatives show promise for scaling up to address water scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor.

* **Pilot Project Examples:**
	+ [Insert specific project examples, including locations, outcomes, and lessons learned].
* **Policy Recommendations:**
	1. Support policy frameworks that encourage adoption of nature-based solutions.
	2. Provide technical assistance for community-led planning and implementation.
	3. Develop economic incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Actions/Recommendations**

To support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in the Central America Dry Corridor:

1. **Support policy frameworks**: Encourage governments to develop and implement policies that promote nature-based solutions.
2. **Provide technical assistance**: Offer training and capacity-building programs for community-led planning and implementation.
3. **Develop economic incentives**: Establish financial mechanisms to support smallholder farmers in adopting agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to water scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor. By supporting policy frameworks, providing technical assistance, and developing economic incentives, we can help communities build resilience against climate-related disasters and improve health outcomes in heatwaves.
