# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Horn of Africa: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Ethiopian Highlands**

### Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa faces severe water scarcity due to climate change impacts, affecting agriculture and human health. This brief proposes an integrated approach combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution for climate-resilient irrigation in the Ethiopian Highlands.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands due to increased precipitation variability (annual range of 600-1400 mm) and reduced average annual rainfall (800-1200 mm). Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive, with borehole pumps consuming [verify] kWh/day and canal systems experiencing significant water loss through evaporation and seepage.

### Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices improve soil health by increasing organic matter (2-8%), biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems provides a sustainable solution for irrigation efficiency, generating [verify] kW of power per system while achieving an energy efficiency rate of 70-80%.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

1.  **Incentives for Farmers:** Implement subsidies or low-interest loans to encourage farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Grid Integration with Micro-Hydro Systems:** Develop infrastructure for grid integration, enabling efficient power distribution from micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Infrastructure Development:** Construct roads and storage facilities to support the implementation of these solutions.
