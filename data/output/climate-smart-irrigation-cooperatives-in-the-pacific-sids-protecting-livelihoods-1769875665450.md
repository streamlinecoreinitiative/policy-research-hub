# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief calls for immediate action to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. To address the region's unique vulnerabilities, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives that integrate renewable energy systems, efficient water management practices, and climate adaptation measures into existing agricultural production systems. By investing in these cooperatives, governments can improve crop yields, reduce water waste, and enhance community resilience to climate-related shocks.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. According to the World Bank Open Data (2024), only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This disparity exposes communities to health risks associated with contaminated water sources. Furthermore, electricity remains out of reach for over half of the region's population (53.3%) [2], and renewable energy consumption is lagging behind global targets (19.7%) [3].

Climate change exacerbates these challenges through more frequent droughts and floods, leading to food insecurity and economic instability. The World Bank estimates that 73.7% of the global population has access to safely managed drinking water, highlighting the significant gap in Sub-Saharan Africa [1]. Similarly, the region's limited infrastructure makes it challenging to expand access efficiently.

## Analysis

Access to safe drinking water is critically low (32.4%), with the World Bank estimating that 73.7% globally and nearly two billion people worldwide lacking access [1]. This disparity exposes communities to health risks associated with contaminated water sources. Similarly, electricity remains out of reach for over half of Sub-Saharan Africa's population (53.3%) [2].

Renewable energy consumption is also lagging behind global targets in Sub-Saharan Africa (19.7%), despite increasing adoption globally (19.7% worldwide) [3]. This underperformance underscores the need for more aggressive policy interventions to accelerate clean energy deployment.

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, policymakers should prioritize:

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in infrastructure projects like boreholes, rainwater harvesting systems, and wastewater treatment facilities. Targeted subsidies for small-scale farmers could also facilitate community-led initiatives.
2. **Increase Renewable Energy Deployment**: Encourage private sector investment through tax incentives and public-private partnerships (PPP). Promote innovative financing mechanisms such as green bonds to fund renewable energy projects in rural areas.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Implement early warning systems for climate events, including droughts and floods. Develop disaster preparedness plans that integrate climate adaptation measures into existing governance structures.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a multi-faceted approach:

* Utilize grants from international organizations like the World Bank or Green Climate Fund (GCF) to fund initial projects.
* Engage local communities in decision-making processes and project implementation. This fosters ownership and sustainability of initiatives.
* Train government officials, community leaders, and service providers on climate change adaptation strategies.

## Conclusion

Ensuring water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is essential for the sustainable development of Sub-Saharan Africa. By prioritizing evidence-based interventions, policymakers can address current challenges while laying a foundation for future growth. This brief calls for immediate action to accelerate progress towards these goals, ensuring long-term stability and prosperity for the region.
