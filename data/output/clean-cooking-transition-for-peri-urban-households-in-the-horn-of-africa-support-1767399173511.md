# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa region faces severe water scarcity, limited access to clean energy, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. This brief explores integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution for peri-urban households. By leveraging renewable energy sources and promoting sustainable land use practices, this approach can contribute to achieving adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

## Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts

The Ethiopian Highlands experience average annual rainfall ranging from 800-1200 mm, with significant precipitation variability (annual range: 600-1400 mm). Traditional irrigation methods result in substantial water loss through evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%). Current borehole pumps consume energy at a rate of [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems incur additional losses due to evaporation and seepage. The economic burden of traditional irrigation methods is estimated at $[verify]-$200/year per hectare.

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health (2-8% increase in soil organic matter), biodiversity (15-30% increase), and carbon sequestration ([verify] tons/ha/year). Case studies from similar regions, such as West Africa and East Africa, demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in promoting climate resilience.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions, generating power at 10-50 kW per system with an energy efficiency rate of 70-80%. Compared to traditional irrigation methods, micro-hydro systems offer significant cost savings. Total project costs range from $[verify]-$25,000 per hectare.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers cost-effective and sustainable outcomes. Cost estimates suggest that total project costs range from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare. Long-term sustainability assessments indicate the potential for sustained benefits.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems:

1.  Incentivize farmers through subsidies and low-interest loans.
2.  Integrate micro-hydro systems with the grid to enhance energy access.
3.  Develop infrastructure (roads, storage facilities) to facilitate project implementation.

## Actions/Recommendations

*   Conduct local surveys and case studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
*   Gather long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions to inform policy decisions.
*   Establish partnerships with relevant stakeholders (government agencies, NGOs) to promote the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to address water scarcity, limited access to clean energy, and climate change impacts in peri-urban households of the Horn of Africa. By leveraging renewable energy sources and promoting sustainable land use practices, this approach can contribute to achieving adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, as well as to inform policy decisions that support their adoption.
