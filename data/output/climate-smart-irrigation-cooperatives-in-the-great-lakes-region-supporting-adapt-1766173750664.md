# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as erratic rainfall and increased evaporation, posing significant challenges to food security and economic stability among smallholder farmers. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating poverty in the region. This brief highlights the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for sustainable irrigation solutions that enhance water security while promoting renewable energy use.

**Climate Change Vulnerability in the Horn of Africa**

The Horn of Africa is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally (NOAA). Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation due to rising temperatures have severe consequences, including crop failures, reduced yields, and decreased livestock productivity. The region's highlands, such as Ethiopia's Oromia region, are particularly susceptible to these impacts (UN Environment Programme).

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Horn of Africa rely heavily on boreholes and canals. However, these methods suffer from significant water loss through evaporation and seepage (World Bank). Water loss due to evaporation is estimated to be substantial, but a specific percentage could not be verified.

**Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems: A Sustainable Solution**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture). By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, communities can reduce their reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency. Pilot projects demonstrating the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro have shown promising results.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives at scale:

1.  **Develop and implement policies that incentivize the use of renewable energy sources for irrigation systems**.
2.  **Provide training and capacity-building programs for smallholder farmers on agroforestry practices and micro-hydro system maintenance**.
3.  **Establish a monitoring and evaluation framework to track the impact of these integrated solutions on water security, food productivity, and community livelihoods**.

Future research should focus on:

1.  **Conducting detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems**.
2.  **Investigating the socioeconomic benefits derived from these integrated solutions, including community acceptance and participation**.
3.  **Developing scalable models for replicating successful pilot projects in other regions of the Horn of Africa**.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution to address the pressing challenges facing smallholder farmers in the Horn of Africa. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, communities can enhance water security while promoting renewable energy use. With the right policies and support, these integrated solutions have the potential to improve food productivity, reduce poverty, and contribute to the region's climate adaptation targets.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop and implement policies that incentivize the use of renewable energy sources for irrigation systems**.
2.  **Provide training and capacity-building programs for smallholder farmers on agroforestry practices and micro-hydro system maintenance**.
3.  **Establish a monitoring and evaluation framework to track the impact of these integrated solutions on water security, food productivity, and community livelihoods**.

**Data Gaps:**

- Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected highland regions in the Horn of Africa.
- Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
- Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
