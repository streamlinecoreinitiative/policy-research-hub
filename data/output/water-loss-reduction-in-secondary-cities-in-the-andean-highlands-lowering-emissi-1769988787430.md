**Climate Resilient Water Supply Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Energy Access and Renewable Integration**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa's water security challenges are exacerbated by limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%) [1] and electricity (53.3%) [2]. To address this, we recommend integrating renewable energy sources like solar photovoltaics into climate-resilient water supply systems. This approach can significantly enhance both water security and energy access in the region.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water security challenges, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. Coupled with limited electricity access at just 53.3%, integrating renewable energy into climate-resilient water supply systems is crucial for improving both water security and energy sufficiency in this region.

## Analysis

### Water Security

The disparity in access to safe drinking water across Sub-Saharan Africa highlights a critical need for improved water supply systems [2]. With 73.7% of the global population having access to safely managed drinking water, Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind [3].

### Energy Access

Limited electricity availability further complicates efforts to provide clean and reliable water sources [4]. Renewable energy consumption in the region stands at just 19.7%, indicating a significant potential for growth [5].

**Renewable Energy Integration** is essential as it not only supports energy sufficiency but also enhances the resilience of water supply systems against climate change impacts such as droughts and floods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Solar-Powered Desalination Plants**: Deploy solar-powered desalination units in arid regions to provide clean drinking water, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
2. **Microgrids for Water Supply Systems**: Integrate microgrid systems into existing water supply infrastructure to enhance reliability and resilience, ensuring communities have access to clean water even during power outages.
3. **Community-Led Renewable Energy Projects**: Encourage local communities to develop their own renewable energy projects, focusing on solar photovoltaics and wind turbines, to promote energy sufficiency and community ownership.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Estimation**: Initial investment for solar-powered desalination plants can range from $500,000 to $1 million per unit [6].
- **Community Engagement**: Engage local communities in planning and decision-making processes to ensure sustainability and community buy-in.
- **Training Programs**: Provide training for technicians and maintenance personnel to operate and maintain renewable energy systems.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa’s water security challenges are intertwined with electricity access. Integrating solar power into climate-resilient water supply systems is a feasible solution that can simultaneously improve both domains, contributing significantly to the region's sustainable development goals.
