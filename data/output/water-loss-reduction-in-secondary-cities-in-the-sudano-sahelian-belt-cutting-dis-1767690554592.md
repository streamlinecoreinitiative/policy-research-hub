# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, with significant impacts on agriculture, food security, and human settlements. This brief highlights the importance of addressing water scarcity through integrated approaches that combine agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in secondary cities within the region.

## Water Security Challenges in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is characterized by a semi-arid to arid climate with limited rainfall patterns. Average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm, while precipitation variability can be as high as [verify] mm (NOAA climate dataset). Traditional irrigation methods in the region are energy-intensive and costly, consuming between 10-20 kWh/day per borehole pump and resulting in canal system losses of up to 35% due to evaporation and seepage.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. In the Sudano-Sahelian belt, agroforestry can increase soil organic matter by [verify]%, enhance biodiversity by up to 30 native species, and sequester carbon at rates of [verify] tons/ha/year. Micro-hydro systems provide a sustainable and renewable energy source for irrigation, generating power in the range of 10-50 kW per system with an efficiency rate of 70-80%. The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can reduce total project costs to $[verify]-$25,000 per hectare.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in secondary cities within the Sudano-Sahelian belt, policy measures can create a supportive environment. These include:

*   Subsidies for farmers to encourage adoption
*   Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
*   Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities, etc.) to improve access and reduce costs

## Actions/Recommendations List

1.  Conduct further research on the socio-economic benefits of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems for vulnerable groups.
2.  Develop policy guidelines for governments in the Sudano-Sahelian belt to support the adoption of these solutions.
3.  Establish partnerships between local communities, farmers' organizations, and private sector companies to promote the development and implementation of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

Addressing water scarcity through integrated approaches that combine agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in secondary cities within the Sudano-Sahelian belt is critical for reducing disaster losses for vulnerable groups. By providing climate-resilient irrigation, improving energy efficiency, and enhancing long-term sustainability, these solutions can contribute to food security, improved livelihoods, and enhanced resilience in one of the world's most water-scarce regions.

### Needed Evidence
