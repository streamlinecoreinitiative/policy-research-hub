# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Caribbean SIDS: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant threats to vulnerable communities in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Caribbean, particularly those relying on watersheds for livelihoods. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a strategy to enhance environmental resilience and reduce disaster losses among these groups. By integrating traditional knowledge with modern conservation practices, SIDS can better adapt to climate change impacts, ensuring the long-term sustainability of their ecosystems and communities.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Caribbean Context

### Overview of Climate Change Impacts on Watersheds in the Caribbean

* Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering water cycles, leading to droughts and floods.
* Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events threaten watershed health and community livelihoods.

### Current Challenges with Traditional Approaches to Watershed Management

* Limited access to resources, capacity, and expertise hinder effective co-management practices.
* Inadequate representation and participation of indigenous communities in decision-making processes exacerbate existing vulnerabilities.

## Designing Effective Watershed Co-Management Initiatives

### Features and Benefits of Indigenous-Led Co-Management

* **Traditional knowledge integration**: Incorporating indigenous perspectives on watershed health, conservation, and adaptation strategies.
* **Community engagement**: Empowering local councils to participate in decision-making processes and ensure equitable resource distribution.
* **Climate-resilient infrastructure**: Implementing climate-resilient water management systems, such as green infrastructure and flood protection measures.

### Case Studies: Successful Watershed Co-Management Initiatives

* Examples of successful co-management initiatives in the Caribbean SIDS, highlighting benefits for community livelihoods and ecosystem health.

## Implementation and Evaluation of Watershed Co-Management Initiatives

### Pilot Projects and Scaling-Up Efforts

* **Pilot projects**: Implementing small-scale co-management initiatives to test effectiveness and scalability.
* **Scaling-up efforts**: Collaborating with local governments, NGOs, and international organizations to promote the adoption of co-management practices in other vulnerable regions.

## Policy Recommendations for Enhancing Watershed Co-Management

### National-Level Policy Recommendations

* **Establishing policy frameworks**: Developing national policies that support watershed co-management, including legislation and regulations.
* **Standardizing best practices**: Establishing guidelines for effective co-management, including training programs and capacity-building initiatives.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils is a critical strategy for enhancing environmental resilience in lower-income countries, particularly those in the Caribbean SIDS. By integrating traditional knowledge with modern conservation practices, these communities can better adapt to climate change impacts, ensuring the long-term sustainability of their ecosystems and livelihoods. As international efforts focus on reducing disaster losses and promoting sustainable development, it is essential that watershed co-management initiatives are prioritized and supported.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support policy frameworks**: Encourage national governments in Caribbean SIDS to establish policies supporting watershed co-management.
2. **Enhance capacity-building**: Provide training programs and resources for indigenous councils to develop their co-management skills.
3. **Promote knowledge sharing**: Facilitate exchange of best practices among communities, organizations, and countries to enhance the effectiveness of co-management initiatives.

**Data Needed:**

* Historical weather data for drought and flood occurrences in Caribbean SIDS
* Surveys from indigenous councils on their experiences with co-management initiatives
* Economic impact assessments to quantify savings or losses avoided due to effective co-management practices
