**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Caribbean SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant threats to smallholder farmers in lower-income countries, particularly those in the Central African Rainforest region. The agricultural sector is heavily reliant on traditional irrigation methods that are often energy-intensive and costly. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Caribbean SIDS**

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face severe water scarcity due to climate change, impacting food security and economic stability for smallholder farmers. Traditional irrigation methods are often energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating the economic challenges faced by these communities.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Caribbean SIDS include boreholes and canals, which suffer from significant water loss through evaporation and seepage. Water loss percentages for existing irrigation systems range from 30% to 50%, although this data requires verification (verify). These inefficiencies not only waste precious water resources but also increase energy consumption.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry systems can enhance water retention and reduce erosion, making them a crucial component in climate-resilient irrigation strategies.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have successfully demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro technology for irrigation efficiency. These integrated systems reduce reliance on diesel generators, decrease energy consumption, and increase water retention. Economic analyses indicate that these systems are cost-effective (verify), although further studies are needed to confirm this.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  **Support policy frameworks**: Encourage governments in the Caribbean SIDS region to adopt policies promoting the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Invest in research and development**: Fund further studies on the economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data relevant to selected regions in the Caribbean SIDS.
3.  **Enhance international cooperation**: Foster partnerships among governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to facilitate knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and resource mobilization for scaling up agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for climate-resilient irrigation in the Caribbean SIDS. By supporting policy frameworks that promote these integrated approaches, investing in research and development, and enhancing international cooperation, we can help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change impacts while improving their economic stability.
