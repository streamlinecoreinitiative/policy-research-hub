**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Southeast Asia: A Pathway to Resilience**

### Executive Summary

To enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Southeast Asia, we recommend prioritizing the implementation of large-scale desalination projects in coastal areas where freshwater is scarce. This initiative should be accompanied by investments in rainwater harvesting systems and groundwater recharge initiatives to ensure sustainable water resources. Additionally, governments should promote solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation through government subsidies and public-private partnerships, while expanding grid infrastructure to connect remote communities to renewable energy sources.

### Context & Challenge

Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change impacts, including water scarcity, energy shortages, and extreme weather events. The region's geography makes it particularly susceptible to sea-level rise, increased frequency of natural disasters like floods and droughts. Currently, only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (2024) [1], while Southeast Asia struggles with freshwater scarcity, with only 26% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (2024) [2]. Energy demand is growing rapidly, yet access remains limited in many countries, especially rural areas.

### Analysis

The region's climate resilience efforts are lagging behind global targets set under the SDGs. For instance, only 74% of the world population has access to safely managed drinking water (UN SDG Report 2023) [3]. Sub-Saharan Africa, including Southeast Asia countries like Indonesia and Philippines, is significantly below this average at 32.4%. Renewable energy consumption in Southeast Asia is currently around 19.7%, far from the 15% target set for 2020 (World Bank Open Data) [4].

### Policy Recommendations

To enhance water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Southeast Asia, policymakers should prioritize the following actions:

1. **Expand Access to Clean Water**: Implement large-scale desalination projects in coastal areas where freshwater is scarce. Invest in rainwater harvesting systems and groundwater recharge initiatives to ensure sustainable water resources.
2. **Strengthen Renewable Energy Systems**: Promote solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation through government subsidies and public-private partnerships. Expand grid infrastructure to connect remote communities to renewable energy sources.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early warning systems for natural disasters using satellite data and AI technologies. Implement climate-resilient agricultural practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties and improved irrigation systems.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require substantial financial resources, which can be sourced from international development agencies, regional funds, and multilateral institutions like the World Bank. Costs for desalination plants, renewable energy installations, and climate adaptation projects are estimated at $10 billion over five years (World Bank Open Data) [5]. However, these investments pay off in terms of economic growth, improved public health, and reduced vulnerability to climate change impacts.

### Conclusion

By focusing on enhancing water security, ensuring clean energy access, and strengthening climate adaptation strategies, Southeast Asia can build a more resilient future. Immediate action is needed to meet SDG targets for water and renewable energy consumption, as well as to prepare communities for the challenges posed by climate change. Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must collaborate to implement these recommendations effectively.
