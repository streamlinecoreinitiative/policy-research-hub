# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Pacific SIDS: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in Pacific SIDS: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief emphasizes the need to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. The region faces significant challenges, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)] and 53.3% relying on electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)]. To address these issues, we recommend investing in improved water supply infrastructure, promoting clean energy access through microgrids and renewable energy sources, and strengthening climate resilience through early-warning systems and community-based disaster management plans.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's population growth and climate variability exacerbate existing water scarcity issues. The region's water security challenges are further compounded by the fact that only 32.4% of its population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], while 53.3% rely on electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)]. These numbers highlight significant gaps in basic infrastructure and services.

## Analysis

Access to safe water is a fundamental need for health and well-being, yet it remains elusive for many in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Bank's data (2024), only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data]. This stark disparity underscores the critical nature of improving water security, particularly given that nearly two billion people globally lack safe water [Source: UN-Water/WHO (2022)]. Ensuring universal access could be transformative in reducing disease prevalence and promoting economic growth.

Regarding clean energy, Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind other regions. Access to electricity stands at only 53.3% [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)], despite the continent's potential for renewable energy sources such as solar and hydroelectric power. The World Bank’s data shows that renewable energy consumption is just 19.7%, a figure well below global averages [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)]. This disparity not only hinders economic development but also exacerbates climate vulnerability.

Climate change poses additional threats to water security and energy access. Sub-Saharan Africa experiences frequent droughts and floods, leading to reduced agricultural productivity and increased reliance on imported food and energy resources. Effective adaptation measures are essential to mitigate these impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security:**
	* Invest in improved water supply infrastructure such as wells, boreholes, and filtration systems.
	* Implement rainwater harvesting initiatives and promote community-based management of water sources.
	* Support small-scale irrigation projects to increase agricultural productivity and resilience against climate shocks.

2. **Promote Clean Energy Access:**
	* Develop microgrids for rural clinics and other essential services using solar power, wind turbines, or hybrid systems.
	* Encourage the use of biogas digesters and other renewable energy sources in households and small-scale industries.
	* Invest in grid infrastructure to connect remote areas with reliable electricity supply.

3. **Strengthen Climate Resilience:**
	* Implement early-warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related disasters.
	* Promote climate-resilient agriculture practices such as agroforestry value chains for cash crops, which can enhance soil health and water retention.
	* Develop community-based disaster management plans to reduce vulnerability.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding:** Mobilize international development funds through grants and concessional loans. Collaborate with multilateral organizations like the World Bank and regional development banks (ADB, EIB) for targeted investments.
- **Capacity Building:** Train local communities in water management techniques and renewable energy technologies to ensure sustainability.
- **Policy Frameworks:** Develop supportive policies that incentivize private sector investment in clean energy projects and promote decentralized energy solutions.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize enhancing water security, promoting clean energy access, and building climate resilience. This will not only improve the quality of life for millions but also contribute to broader development goals such as achieving universal electricity access (SDG 7) and ensuring safe drinking water for all (SDG 6). By taking swift action on these fronts, policymakers can lay a strong foundation for sustainable growth in the region.

**Call to Action:** Governments, NGOs, and international partners must collaborate to implement the recommended interventions. Immediate investments in infrastructure and capacity building are crucial to realizing these goals within the next five years.
