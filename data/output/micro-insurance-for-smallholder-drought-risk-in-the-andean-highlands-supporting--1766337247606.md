**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change is exacerbating drought risks in the Andean highlands, impacting smallholder farmers' livelihoods and food security. This brief argues that micro-insurance can play a crucial role in supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By providing financial protection against crop failures due to drought, micro-insurance can help smallholders invest in climate-resilient agriculture practices.

**Section 1: Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Andean Highlands**

Climate change is altering precipitation patterns in the Andean highlands, leading to increased drought frequency and severity. [Verify] Average annual rainfall in this region ranges from 800-1200 mm, with significant variability between years. Traditional irrigation systems suffer from water loss due to evaporation and seepage.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods in the Andean highlands are often energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems experience significant water loss due to evaporation and seepage. The economic impact of these practices is substantial, with costs per hectare ranging from $100-$200/year.

**Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration in various regions. In the Andean highlands, agroforestry can help smallholders adapt to drought conditions by:

* Increasing soil organic matter
* Enhancing biodiversity
* Sequestering carbon

Micro-insurance can provide financial protection for smallholder farmers who invest in climate-resilient agriculture practices like agroforestry.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Renewable Energy and Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems offer a sustainable solution to energy needs in the Andean highlands. These small-scale hydroelectric plants can provide power generation, energy efficiency, and cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop and promote micro-insurance products tailored to smallholder drought risks**
2. **Support the development of climate-resilient agriculture practices like agroforestry and conservation agriculture**
3. **Invest in renewable energy solutions, such as micro-hydro systems, for irrigation efficiency and cost savings**
4. **Foster policy and regulatory environments that encourage sustainable agriculture practices and renewable energy adoption**

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of micro-insurance with climate-resilient agriculture practices can provide a cost-effective solution to drought risks in the Andean highlands. By supporting smallholder farmers' adaptation efforts, we can contribute to achieving NDCs and the Paris Agreement's goals.
