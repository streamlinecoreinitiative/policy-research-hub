# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Central America dry corridor: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Central America Dry Corridor: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the region. By investing in these cooperatives, governments can increase access to safe drinking water, promote renewable energy consumption, and enhance climate resilience. Specifically, we suggest implementing the following policy:

* Establish at least 100 climate-smart irrigation cooperatives across Sub-Saharan Africa by 2027, focusing on regions with high water scarcity and limited infrastructure.
* Provide technical assistance and training for cooperative members to develop and implement climate-resilient irrigation systems, such as micro-hydro schemes and solar-powered pumps.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in providing safe drinking water, electricity access, and renewable energy consumption. According to the World Bank Open Data (2024), only 32.4% of the population had access to safely managed drinking water, while 53.3% relied on electricity. The region's reliance on fossil fuels for power generation contributes significantly to carbon emissions, further complicating efforts towards decarbonization.

## Analysis

* **Water Security**: As of 2024, only 32.4% of the Sub-Saharan African population had access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). In contrast, globally this figure stands at 73.7% (World Bank Open Data).
* **Electricity Access**: While 91.6% of the world's population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data), only 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa does (World Bank Open Data).
* **Renewable Energy Consumption**: Despite a global trend towards renewable energy consumption, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with limited data available on its current level of renewable energy consumption.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, decision-makers should prioritize the following:

1. **Increase Investment in Water Infrastructure**: Fund projects aimed at expanding access to safe drinking water sources, including boreholes, pipelines, and sanitation facilities. Implement cost-sharing mechanisms with communities to ensure sustainability.
2. **Enhance Renewable Energy Integration**: Develop policy frameworks that incentivize renewable energy investments, such as feed-in tariffs or subsidies for solar panels and wind turbines. Support small-scale hydroelectric projects in regions with suitable geology.
3. **Promote Climate Resilient Technologies**: Invest in climate-resilient irrigation systems like micro-hydro schemes, which can integrate into existing water resources to provide reliable power during droughts.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require addressing several practical considerations:

* **Funding Constraints**: Mobilize international financial assistance and domestic revenue streams through innovative financing mechanisms such as blended finance or public-private partnerships.
* **Technical Barriers**: Collaborate with local engineering firms and universities to develop tailored solutions that align with regional needs and expertise.

## Conclusion

Ensuring water security, clean energy, and climate resilience is crucial for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By adopting evidence-based policies and fostering collaborative efforts, governments can make substantial progress towards achieving SDGs 6, 7, and 13. Next steps include continued research to inform future interventions and scaling up successful initiatives.
