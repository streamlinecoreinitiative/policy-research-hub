**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to strengthen climate resilience in school feeding supply chains across the Horn of Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water and just 53.3% with access to electricity, the region is particularly vulnerable to climate-induced shocks (World Bank Open Data). To address this challenge, we recommend implementing targeted interventions for improved water supply systems, enhancing renewable energy adoption, and strengthening community-based climate resilience programs.

## Context & Challenge

The Horn of Africa is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally. Climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall patterns exacerbate existing challenges like inadequate access to clean water, limited electricity supply, and reduced agricultural productivity (World Bank Open Data). The urgency of addressing these challenges requires immediate action due to their direct impact on public health, economic stability, and social well-being within the region.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa has a water withdrawal rate of only 9.2%, far below global levels (19.7%) [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data). The region lacks sufficient infrastructure for safe drinking water supply, with less than 30% having access to safely managed sources. This disparity impacts agricultural productivity and public health.

### Clean Energy Access

Despite the world’s highest renewable energy consumption rate of 19.7%, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in electricity access (53.3%) [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data). This disparity impacts economic development, education, and overall quality of life.

### Climate Adaptation

The region is particularly vulnerable to climate-induced shocks like droughts and floods, which threaten water security and agricultural productivity. A recent study highlights the need for early warning systems, resilient crop varieties, and nature-based solutions (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Interventions for Water Security**:
    *   Invest in desalination plants and improved distribution systems to enhance access to safe drinking water.
    *   Support small-scale irrigation projects to increase crop yields and reduce reliance on rain-fed agriculture.
    *   Promote community-led initiatives for water resource management, including the construction of boreholes and community wells.

2.  **Enhancing Clean Energy Access**:
    *   Encourage private sector investment in renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines.
    *   Implement feed-in tariffs to incentivize households and businesses to adopt clean energy solutions.
    *   Expand grid extension programs to reach rural areas with limited access to electricity.

3.  **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
    *   Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters, including droughts and floods.
    *   Support agricultural research and development of resilient crop varieties that can withstand harsh weather conditions.
    *   Foster collaboration between governments, NGOs, and the private sector to implement nature-based solutions like reforestation and soil conservation.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure the success of these interventions, we recommend:

*   Establishing dedicated funds for implementing these interventions
*   Collaborating with local communities and civil society organizations to ensure sustainability and effectiveness
*   Implementing innovative financing mechanisms to address limited funding

## Conclusion

The urgency of improving water security, expanding access to clean energy, and enhancing resilience against climate impacts cannot be overstated in the Horn of Africa. By taking immediate action on the outlined recommendations, stakeholders can significantly improve living conditions for millions of people while laying a foundation for sustainable development.
