**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

### Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and poverty. The transition to clean cooking practices is crucial for reducing emissions from critical sectors such as energy, agriculture, and waste management. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in providing climate-resilient irrigation solutions while promoting sustainable cooking practices.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Delta

The Lower Mekong delta is a densely populated region with limited access to clean water and energy. Climate change has exacerbated these challenges, leading to severe droughts and floods that impact agriculture, food security, and economic stability. The importance of resilient irrigation methods cannot be overstated, as they are critical for ensuring food security and economic stability.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

The existing irrigation systems in the Lower Mekong delta rely heavily on boreholes and canals, resulting in significant water losses due to evaporation and seepage [verify]. These inefficiencies exacerbate water scarcity and undermine agricultural productivity. The need for innovative solutions that address these challenges is pressing.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion and promote more efficient use of water resources [verify]. Case studies from the region demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving water retention.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for increasing irrigation efficiency while reducing reliance on diesel generators and promoting energy independence. These small-scale hydroelectric systems can be integrated with existing irrigation infrastructure to provide clean energy for pumping water, thereby reducing energy costs and emissions.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects in the region have successfully combined agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to create climate-resilient water supply solutions. These integrated approaches not only improve irrigation efficiency but also promote sustainable agriculture practices, reduce erosion, and increase carbon sequestration.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of these innovative solutions at scale, we recommend:

1. **Policy Support**: Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Capacity Building**: Training programs should be established to equip farmers with the skills necessary to design, install, and maintain these integrated systems.
3. **Research and Development**: Further research is needed to evaluate the economic impact of these solutions, assess community engagement, and identify areas for improvement.

### Actions/Recommendations

1. **Develop a policy framework** that supports the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale.
2. **Establish training programs** to equip farmers with the skills necessary to design, install, and maintain these integrated systems.
3. **Conduct further research** on the economic impact, community engagement, and areas for improvement.

### Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households of the Lower Mekong delta is crucial for reducing emissions from critical sectors. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for providing climate-resilient irrigation solutions while promoting sustainable agriculture practices. By integrating these innovative approaches, we can create more resilient and sustainable water supply systems that benefit both farmers and communities.

Note: I removed the speculative claim about 30% water loss due to evaporation and 5% seepage as it was not supported by a source. I also kept the length similar and preserved the title.
