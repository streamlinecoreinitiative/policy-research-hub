**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to strengthen resilience among rural communities, particularly in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. We recommend implementing policies that promote renewable energy projects, enhance water management infrastructure, and develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters.

**Key Findations**: [NEEDS SOURCE] Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the lowest rates of safe drinking water compared to the global average. Additionally, only 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing temperatures and altering precipitation patterns.

**Recommendations**: Implement policies promoting renewable energy projects in rural areas, enhance water management infrastructure, and develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the least developed regions globally, with many countries struggling to provide basic necessities like clean water and electricity. Climate change intensifies these challenges by reducing access to safe drinking water and increasing the frequency of droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.

**Background**: The region's limited access to safely managed drinking water underscores the need for improved water infrastructure and technologies [1]. Only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity, with rural areas being particularly underserved [2].

### Analysis

**Water Security**: The region's limited access to safely managed drinking water highlights the need for improved water infrastructure and technologies like rainwater harvesting systems and micro-hydropower plants [1]. Freshwater withdrawal as a percentage of resources is 9.2% globally, but this figure varies by country [3].

**Clean Energy**: Only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity, with rural areas being particularly underserved [2]. Investing in solar-powered mini-grids can provide reliable power to remote communities.

**Climate Adaptation**: Increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns necessitate the development of early warning systems for climate-related disasters such as floods and droughts. These systems are crucial for saving lives and reducing economic losses.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
	* Implement rainwater harvesting ponds in rural areas.
	* Promote micro-hydropower plants that provide clean energy while also improving water management.
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Use**:
	* Invest in solar-powered mini-grids for off-grid communities, especially in remote regions.
	* Encourage the use of biogas digesters to produce renewable energy from organic waste and improve sanitation.
3. **Develop Early Warning Systems**:
	* Establish early warning systems using satellite imagery and ground sensors to predict and mitigate climate-related disasters.
	* Train community members to respond quickly to alerts, minimizing loss of life and property damage.

### Implementation Considerations

* **Costs**: The initial investment in water infrastructure (e.g., rainwater harvesting ponds) can range from $50,000-$100,000 per project. For renewable energy projects like solar-powered mini-grids, costs vary but are generally lower than traditional grid extensions.
* **Barriers**: Access to financing and technical expertise may be challenging in rural areas. Collaboration with local governments, NGOs, and private sector partners can help overcome these hurdles.

### Conclusion

Rural communities in Sub-Saharan Africa require urgent interventions to ensure water security, access to clean energy, and climate resilience. By implementing the recommended policies and considering practical implementation steps, we can significantly improve living conditions for millions of people affected by water scarcity and climate change.
