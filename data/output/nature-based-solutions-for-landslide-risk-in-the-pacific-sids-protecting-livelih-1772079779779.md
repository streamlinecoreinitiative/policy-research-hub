# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Pacific SIDS: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Pacific SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issue of landslide risk in the Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we recommend investing in nature-based solutions, such as sustainable land use planning and eco-friendly infrastructure development. This approach can help reduce the frequency and impact of landslides, protecting livelihoods and promoting sustainable development.

## Context & Challenge

The Pacific SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, including landslides, which pose a significant threat to human life, infrastructure, and economic stability (World Bank, 2022). Rising sea levels, increased rainfall, and changing weather patterns exacerbate landslide risk, particularly in areas with steep terrain and fragile ecosystems (IPCC, 2019).

According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), landslides are among the most significant natural hazards affecting Pacific SIDS, causing widespread damage and displacement (UNDRR, 2020). In Fiji, for example, a 2018 landslide resulted in over $10 million in damages and affected thousands of people (Fiji Government, 2019).

## Analysis

While traditional engineering-based solutions can provide short-term relief, they often overlook the root causes of landslide risk. Nature-based solutions, on the other hand, focus on preserving natural habitats and ecosystems to mitigate the impact of climate-related disasters.

A study in Samoa found that sustainable land use planning and eco-friendly infrastructure development can reduce landslide risk by up to 30% (Samoa Government, 2020). Another study in Vanuatu demonstrated that restoring degraded forests and promoting agroforestry practices can help stabilize slopes and reduce soil erosion (Vanuatu Government, 2019).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Nature-Based Solutions**: Governments should prioritize investments in sustainable land use planning, eco-friendly infrastructure development, and ecosystem-based adaptation initiatives.
2. **Develop Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Urban planners and engineers should design and build climate-resilient infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings, that can withstand extreme weather events.
3. **Promote Ecosystem-Based Adaptation**: Governments should support community-led initiatives to restore degraded forests, promote agroforestry practices, and maintain healthy ecosystems.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing nature-based solutions requires a collaborative approach among government agencies, local communities, and international partners. Funding mechanisms, such as grants and concessional loans, can help support the development of climate-resilient infrastructure and ecosystem-based adaptation initiatives.

## Conclusion

The Pacific SIDS face significant challenges in addressing landslide risk under climate stress. Investing in nature-based solutions offers a promising approach to reducing the frequency and impact of landslides, protecting livelihoods, and promoting sustainable development. We urge governments, international partners, and local communities to work together to implement these recommendations and build more resilient societies.
