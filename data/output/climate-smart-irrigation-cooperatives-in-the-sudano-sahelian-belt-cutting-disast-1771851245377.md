# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief argues that investing in climate-smart irrigation cooperatives is crucial to reducing disaster losses and improving water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. We recommend governments allocate dedicated funds from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to support small-scale renewable energy projects for irrigation systems, aiming to increase renewable energy consumption by at least 5% annually.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and electricity, with only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water sources (World Bank Open Data). Electricity access is even more limited, at [VERIFY] 53.3%, far below the global average of [SOURCE: World Bank Open Data] 91.6%. These disparities underscore a critical need for policy interventions that address both immediate and long-term energy and water security needs.

The Sudano-Sahelian belt, spanning across several countries in West Africa, is particularly vulnerable to climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods. The region's limited access to renewable energy (less than 19% of global consumption) exacerbates these challenges (World Bank Open Data). Climate change projections indicate a continued increase in extreme weather events, further straining already fragile water and energy systems.

## Analysis

The current reliance on fossil fuels for irrigation and energy generation is unsustainable and contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Investing in renewable energy can not only reduce these emissions but also create jobs and stimulate local economies. However, the transition to a low-carbon economy requires significant investment in infrastructure, training, and policy support.

Climate-smart agriculture practices, including climate-resilient irrigation systems, can help farmers adapt to changing weather patterns. These practices can improve crop yields, reduce water consumption, and enhance food security. However, their adoption is often hindered by limited access to finance, technology, and knowledge.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy**: Allocate dedicated funds from the GCF to support small-scale renewable energy projects for irrigation systems.
2. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**: Upgrade existing water systems with modern filtration technologies, particularly in rural areas where access is lowest. Introduce community-managed water points powered by renewable energy sources like solar panels.
3. **Promote Climate Resilience**: Develop early warning systems for climate-induced shocks and integrate them into national disaster management plans. Collaborate with local communities to create micro-grids that use traditional biomass alongside renewables.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these policies will require:

* **Funding**: Mobilize additional resources from international donors, including the GCF, World Bank, and private sector investments.
* **Capacity Building**: Train engineers, technicians, and community leaders in renewable energy installation and maintenance. Provide ongoing support to ensure sustainability.
* **Policy Frameworks**: Establish clear guidelines for water resource management and renewable energy deployment at both national and local levels.

## Conclusion

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is on the frontlines of climate change impacts, with vulnerable communities facing significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and electricity. Investing in climate-smart irrigation cooperatives can help reduce disaster losses, improve water security, and promote clean energy access. We urge governments to prioritize these interventions and allocate dedicated funds from the GCF to support small-scale renewable energy projects.
