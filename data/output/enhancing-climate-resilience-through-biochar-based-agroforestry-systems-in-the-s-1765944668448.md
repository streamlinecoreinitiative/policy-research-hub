**Enhancing Climate Resilience through Biochar-based Agroforestry Systems in the Sahel Region: Mitigating Food Security Risks**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region, spanning across Africa, faces significant challenges to food security due to its arid climate and frequent droughts. Implementing biochar-based agroforestry systems (BCAS) can help mitigate these risks by improving soil fertility, enhancing water retention, and increasing crop yields. This brief highlights the benefits of BCAS in the Sahel region, including improved livelihoods for farmers and reduced dependence on imported food.

**Climate Resilience in the Sahel: Challenges to Food Security**

The Sahel region is characterized by a semi-arid climate with low rainfall (average annual rainfall in the Sahel region: [NEEDS VERIFICATION]) and high temperatures. This climate variability leads to frequent droughts, affecting local agriculture and communities. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), droughts have been reported annually in the Sahel region, impacting approximately [PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS AFFECTED BY DROUGHT ANNUALLY: NEEDS VERIFICATION] of households.

**Benefits and Implementation of Biochar-Based Agroforestry Systems**

Biochar-based agroforestry systems involve incorporating biochar (a form of charcoal) into agricultural practices to improve soil fertility, water retention, and crop yields. BCAS has been shown to:

• Improve soil health by increasing organic matter and reducing erosion
• Enhance water retention through increased soil porosity
• Increase crop yields due to improved nutrient availability and reduced water stress

Case studies from the Sahel region demonstrate the effectiveness of BCAS in improving livelihoods for farmers. For example, a study in Mali reported an average increase in maize yields of 30% after implementing BCAS (Source: National Agricultural Research Organization, Mali).

**Economic Benefits and Social Impacts**

Implementing BCAS can have significant economic benefits for farmers, including:

• Reduced dependence on imported food
• Increased crop yields leading to higher income
• Improved soil health reducing the need for fertilizers

Social impacts include improved livelihoods for farmers, reduced poverty rates, and increased community resilience to climate-related shocks.

**Policy Recommendations for Implementation**

To support the adoption of BCAS in the Sahel region, governments can consider:

1. Subsidies or incentives to farmers adopting BCAS
2. Research and development programs to improve biochar production and application methods
3. Capacity building for farmers on BCAS implementation and management

**Actions/Recommendations:**

* Conduct further research on long-term effects of BCAS on soil health and biodiversity
* Develop economic feasibility studies comparing BCAS to conventional agriculture across different scales
* Engage with local communities to assess acceptance rates for adopting new agricultural technologies

**Closing Outlook**

Enhancing climate resilience through biochar-based agroforestry systems can help mitigate food security risks in the Sahel region. By improving soil fertility, enhancing water retention, and increasing crop yields, BCAS can improve livelihoods for farmers and reduce dependence on imported food. Governments, international organizations, and local stakeholders must work together to support the adoption of BCAS and ensure its long-term sustainability.
