# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Lower Mekong delta: raising resilience finance for communities

**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Lower Mekong Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges with water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. This region is at the forefront of global climate change impacts, necessitating immediate and robust policy interventions to ensure sustainable development. The primary recommendation is to implement community-led water management systems, increase renewable energy investments, and enhance climate adaptation measures.

Key findings:

* 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water [1], compared to a global average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* Only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, compared to 91.6% worldwide [2].

Recommendations:

* Implement community-led water management systems to improve access and hygiene practices.
* Increase renewable energy investments through grants and subsidies for solar and wind power installations in off-grid communities.

Actionable steps:

* Develop public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects.
* Allocate dedicated funding streams for climate adaptation measures.
* Engage local communities in decision-making processes to ensure effective implementation.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is among the regions with the lowest access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%). Climate change exacerbates these issues, making adaptation measures essential for sustainable development [3]. The environment encompasses all living and non-living components of the Earth, while resilience refers to an organism's ability to recover from or adapt to adverse conditions [4].

## Analysis

Water security is a critical issue in Sub-Saharan Africa, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This is due to inadequate infrastructure and policies that fail to address water scarcity and poor sanitation [5]. Clean energy access is also a significant challenge, with only 53.3% of the population having access to electricity, compared to 91.6% worldwide [2].

Climate change impacts are severe in Sub-Saharan Africa, with temperatures rising and rainfall patterns shifting unpredictably [6]. Without resilient infrastructure and policies, these regions will face increasing risks.

## Policy Recommendations

### Water Security:

1. Invest in community-led water management systems to improve access and hygiene practices.
	* Implement rainwater harvesting projects for decentralized water supply solutions.
	* Support desalination technologies where feasible, especially near coastal areas.
2. Increase renewable energy investments through grants and subsidies for solar and wind power installations in off-grid communities.

### Clean Energy Access:

1. Promote community-owned micro-grids to reduce reliance on central grids.
	* Invest in energy efficiency measures to minimize electricity demand.
2. Develop public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects.

### Climate Adaptation:

1. Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters, such as droughts and floods.
	* Implement soil conservation practices to mitigate water loss from erosion.
	* Encourage community-based adaptation projects that leverage local knowledge and resources.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in infrastructure can range from $10 million to $50 million per project [7]. Long-term savings from reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, and enhanced resilience justify these expenses. Potential barriers include limited financial resources, lack of institutional support, and resistance to change among local communities.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges with water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Immediate action is required to address these issues, and the primary recommendation is to implement community-led water management systems, increase renewable energy investments, and enhance climate adaptation measures.
