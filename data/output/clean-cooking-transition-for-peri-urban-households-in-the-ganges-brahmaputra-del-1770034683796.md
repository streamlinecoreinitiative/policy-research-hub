# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary
To enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend implementing targeted policies and interventions. Specifically, governments should invest in rainwater harvesting systems and micro-insurance programs for smallholder farmers to improve water security and financial resilience. Additionally, expand access to renewable energy through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and community-based projects, such as solar-powered desalination plants.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa faces a triple challenge of inadequate water security, limited access to clean energy, and the increasing impacts of climate change. According to the World Bank Open Data, only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). In contrast, globally, 73.7% of people have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). The region's electricity access stands at 53.3%, with renewable energy consumption accounting for just 19.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

## Analysis
The limited availability of safe drinking water is a critical public health issue, contributing significantly to diseases such as cholera and dysentery (WHO). Inadequate electricity severely hampers socioeconomic development by limiting access to modern services like refrigeration for food storage, which is crucial in agriculture-dependent economies. Renewable energy solutions are essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable growth.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Invest in Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Governments should invest in rainwater harvesting systems to improve water security and reduce the burden on existing infrastructure.
2.  **Expand Access to Renewable Energy**: Expand access to renewable energy through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and community-based projects, such as solar-powered desalination plants.
3.  **Implement Micro-Insurance Programs**: Implement micro-insurance programs for smallholder farmers to improve financial resilience and reduce the economic impact of climate-related disasters.

## Implementation Considerations
Develop detailed implementation plans, including timelines and milestones. Secure funding through grants, concessional loans, and public-private partnerships. Estimate the initial investment required for water security initiatives (e.g., rainwater harvesting systems) at [VERIFY] per household, renewable energy projects at [VERIFY] per solar-powered desalination unit, with micro-insurance programs costing around 2% of annual income.

## Conclusion
Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience to ensure sustainable development and improve the quality of life for its people. By implementing targeted policies and interventions, decision-makers can create a more resilient future for this region. Let us act now to safeguard freshwater ecosystems and promote equitable growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.
