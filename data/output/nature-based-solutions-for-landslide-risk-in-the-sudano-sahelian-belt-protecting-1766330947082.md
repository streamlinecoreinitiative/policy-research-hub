# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant threats to livelihoods in lower-income countries, particularly in regions like the Sudano-Sahelian belt where water scarcity and landslides are increasingly prevalent. This brief highlights nature-based solutions that can mitigate landslide risk while promoting climate resilience.

## Current Challenges and Opportunities

### Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

*   Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, exacerbating water scarcity in the region.
*   Agriculture is particularly vulnerable, as crops require consistent moisture levels for optimal growth.
*   Existing irrigation systems often rely on diesel generators or boreholes, which are energy-intensive and prone to failure.

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

*   Agroforestry practices promote soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, reducing erosion and landslides.
*   Case studies demonstrate that agroforestry systems improve water retention, reduce evaporation, and increase crop yields.
*   Benefits extend beyond agriculture, as agroforestry can also provide habitat for threatened species.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficient Irrigation

*   Micro-hydro technology harnesses the energy of small-scale hydroelectric systems to power irrigation pumps.
*   This approach reduces reliance on diesel generators, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and operating costs.
*   Benefits include increased water efficiency, reduced labor requirements, and improved crop quality.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems

*   Pilot projects demonstrate the feasibility of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.
*   Economic analysis shows cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up these integrated solutions.
*   Community engagement is crucial, as local acceptance and participation are essential for successful implementation.

### Policy Recommendations

1.  **Support Research and Development:** Governments can provide funding for research on agroforestry-micro-hydro systems to improve their efficiency and scalability.
2.  **Develop Climate-Resilient Irrigation Guidelines:** Establish guidelines that integrate best practices from agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, promoting climate-resilient irrigation methods.
3.  **Foster Community Engagement:** Encourage community participation in the planning and implementation of these integrated solutions to ensure their long-term sustainability.

### Future Research Directions

1.  **Economic Impact Analysis:** Conduct thorough economic analyses to assess the cost-effectiveness of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale.
2.  **Social Acceptance Studies:** Investigate community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions, identifying areas for improvement.
3.  **Scaling Up Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Systems:** Develop strategies for scaling up successful pilot projects to reach a wider audience.
