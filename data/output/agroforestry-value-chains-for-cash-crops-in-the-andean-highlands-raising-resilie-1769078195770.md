**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Andean Highlands: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the need to strengthen environmental resilience in lower-income countries, focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. To address these challenges, we recommend establishing agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Andean highlands. This approach will enhance community resilience by providing a sustainable source of income, improving water management, and promoting renewable energy use.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental challenges, including inadequate access to safe drinking water [VERIFY] (32.4%) and electricity [VERIFY] (53.3%), exacerbating climate vulnerability (World Bank Open Data). The region's limited capacity for renewable energy consumption at 19.7% underscores the need for accelerated investments in clean energy infrastructure (World Bank Open Data).

## Analysis

### Water Security:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water sources, highlighting a pressing need for improved water management systems [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* The continent relies heavily on unsustainable water withdrawal practices, with freshwater resources accounting for only 9.2% of the world's total resources (World Bank Open Data).

### Clean Energy Access:

* Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in renewable energy consumption at 19.7%, significantly below global averages [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* The region's limited capacity for clean energy adoption is a major barrier to achieving sustainable development goals.

### Climate Adaptation:

* Climate change poses significant threats, including increased frequency of droughts and floods, which further complicate efforts in water security and clean energy access.
* Early warning systems can mitigate climate-induced disasters, focusing on regions prone to flooding or droughts (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops**: Develop sustainable agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Andean highlands, promoting community-led initiatives and providing a stable source of income.
2. **Invest in Renewable Energy Projects**: Invest in solar power plants and wind farms with government subsidies for small-scale renewable energy projects, particularly in off-grid areas where grid extension is impractical (World Bank Open Data).
3. **Strengthen Resilient Infrastructure**: Develop early warning systems to mitigate climate-induced disasters, focusing on regions prone to flooding or droughts.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs associated with implementing these recommendations range from $X per household for water treatment units and $Y per solar panel installation [VERIFY].
* Potential barriers include low government funding, lack of skilled labor, and resistance to change among communities. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to build more resilient societies. By adopting evidence-based policies and fostering public-private partnerships, the region can significantly reduce its vulnerability to climate change impacts while promoting sustainable development. Establishing agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Andean highlands is a crucial step towards achieving these goals.
