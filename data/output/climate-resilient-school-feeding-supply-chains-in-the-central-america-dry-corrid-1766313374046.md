# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Central America dry corridor: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Central America Dry Corridor: Enhancing Water Security and Food Resilience**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, with frequent droughts and floods affecting agricultural production and food security. The school feeding program, which provides meals to millions of children, is particularly susceptible to these impacts. This brief proposes an integrated approach to enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor**

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the region, affecting agriculture and food production. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are leading to more frequent droughts and floods, which have severe impacts on crop yields and livestock productivity. The school feeding program relies heavily on local agricultural products, making it vulnerable to climate-related shocks.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the region are inefficient and often rely on diesel generators, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Water loss from these systems is significant, with estimates suggesting that up to [verify] % of water is lost through evaporation and seepage.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies from the region demonstrate that agroforestry can also enhance water retention and reduce erosion. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can create more resilient and sustainable irrigation systems.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology is a small-scale hydroelectric system that provides reliable and renewable energy for irrigation pumps, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance water security. These integrated solutions can reduce disaster losses and improve food security, contributing to sustainable development goals.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support adoption at scale:

* Governments should provide incentives for communities to adopt agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
* International organizations should provide technical assistance and funding for pilot projects.
* Further research is needed on the economic impact of these integrated solutions, as well as community engagement and acceptance.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop a regional policy framework** to support adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Establish a technical assistance program** to provide training and capacity-building for communities.
3. **Conduct further research** on the economic impact, community engagement, and scaling up of these integrated solutions.

**Closing Outlook**

The climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Central America dry corridor is a critical issue that requires innovative solutions. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for irrigation, vulnerable communities can reduce disaster losses and improve food security, contributing to sustainable development goals.
