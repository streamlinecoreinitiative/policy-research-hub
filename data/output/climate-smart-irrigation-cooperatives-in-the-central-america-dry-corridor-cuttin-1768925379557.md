# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Central America dry corridor: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Strengthening Water Security, Renewable Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Path Forward**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing issues of water security, renewable energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a key intervention. These cooperatives will integrate climate forecasts into decision-making processes, enhancing disaster losses resilience for vulnerable groups. By investing in infrastructure projects like rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants, promoting community-led initiatives such as watershed co-management with indigenous councils, and ensuring equitable access by focusing on rural areas, governments, NGOs, and international organizations can improve water security. Furthermore, developing supportive policies for renewable energy deployment, encouraging community-based solar projects, and increasing investment in microgrids and off-grid solutions will enhance clean energy access.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events [IPCC, 2020]. The region's economic development is hindered significantly due to poor water management practices leading to widespread water scarcity. Additionally, the lack of reliable electricity sources contributes to a myriad of socio-economic challenges including health issues and reduced productivity. Climate change exacerbates these problems through more frequent droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.

According to World Bank data [2024], only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to the global average of 73.7% [World Bank, 2024]. This disparity underscores the urgent need for interventions focused on improving water security. The region's renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7% globally [World Bank, 2020], highlighting the need for increased investment in clean energy access.

### Analysis

The current scenario in Sub-Saharan Africa highlights stark contrasts between developed regions and those facing severe water scarcity and energy deficits. For instance, the region's access to safely managed drinking water is only 32.4%, a fraction of global coverage at 73.7% [World Bank, 2024]. This disparity underscores the urgent need for interventions focused on improving water security.

Regarding renewable energy consumption, Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind the world average, with just 19.7% of its total final energy consumption coming from renewables [World Bank, 2020]. The UN SDG report indicates that globally only 74% of populations have access to safely managed drinking water [UN SDG Report, 2023], which is a significant gap compared to Sub-Saharan Africa's current status.

Climate change poses additional challenges. According to NOAA climate data, the region experiences frequent droughts and floods, further straining already limited resources. These events not only disrupt agricultural productivity but also exacerbate health risks such as waterborne diseases due to contaminated water supplies.

### Policy Recommendations

To address these pressing issues, it is crucial for governments, NGOs, and international organizations to implement a suite of evidence-based interventions:

1. **Enhance Water Security:**
	* Invest in infrastructure projects like rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants.
	* Promote community-led initiatives such as watershed co-management with indigenous councils to enhance disaster losses resilience.
	* Ensure equitable access by focusing on rural areas, providing subsidies for water treatment facilities.

2. **Promote Clean Energy Access:**
	* Develop supportive policies for renewable energy deployment, including tax incentives and grants.
	* Encourage community-based solar projects that can be scaled up to provide electricity access in remote areas.
	* Increase investment in microgrids and off-grid solutions to reach underserved populations.

3. **Build Climate Resilience:**
	* Establish early-warning systems that can be deployed through last-mile alerts.
	* Implement nature-based solutions like afforestation or reforestation projects to enhance natural water retention capacity.
	* Develop climate-smart irrigation cooperatives that integrate climate forecasts into decision-making processes.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require careful planning and coordination among various stakeholders. Key considerations include:

* **Funding:** Securing adequate funding from both public and private sources is crucial for large-scale projects.
* **Capacity Building:** Training local communities in the implementation of water management, renewable energy deployment, and climate adaptation strategies is essential.
* **Policy Frameworks:** Developing supportive legal frameworks that encourage innovation and investment in these areas will be vital.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa stands to benefit immensely from concerted efforts aimed at improving water security, increasing clean energy access, and bolstering climate resilience. By adopting the recommendations outlined here, policymakers can pave the way for more sustainable and resilient development outcomes across the region.

**Call to Action:**
We urge governments, NGOs, and international organizations to prioritize these interventions in their respective strategies. Collaboration is key to achieving long-term success. Let's work together to ensure a brighter future for Sub-Saharan Africa through enhanced water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience.
