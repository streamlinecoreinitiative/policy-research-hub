# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts and heatwaves that significantly impact the health and livelihoods of peri-urban households. This brief focuses on transitioning to clean cooking practices as a critical component of environmental resilience in this region.

## Environmental Resilience in Peri-Urban Households

### Water Security Challenges

*   Climate change is exacerbating droughts and water scarcity in the Central America dry corridor.
*   Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, further straining economic resources for smallholder farmers.
*   Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a sustainable solution to enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

### Current Cooking Practices

*   Peri-urban households rely heavily on firewood and charcoal for cooking, contributing significantly to deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions.
*   Indoor air pollution from traditional cooking methods poses serious health risks, particularly during heatwaves when ventilation is limited.

## Transitioning to Clean Cooking Practices

### Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems

*   Agroforestry practices can improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing water loss through evaporation.
*   Micro-hydro systems offer a renewable energy source for irrigation and other household needs, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.

### Clean Cooking Technologies

*   Improved cookstoves and solar ovens can reduce fuelwood consumption and decrease indoor air pollution significantly. [verify]
*   Community-based initiatives promoting clean cooking practices have shown significant health benefits and economic savings.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Support for Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems:**
    *   Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, including subsidies for equipment and training.
2.  **Promotion of Clean Cooking Technologies:**
    *   Governments and NGOs should promote the use of improved cookstoves and solar ovens through community outreach programs and subsidies.
3.  **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Development:**
    *   Governments should invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, including water harvesting systems and renewable energy installations.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Conduct a comprehensive assessment of peri-urban households' energy needs and cooking practices.**
2.  **Develop and implement policies to support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems and clean cooking technologies.**
3.  **Establish community-based initiatives to promote clean cooking practices and provide training on improved cookstoves and solar ovens.**

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households is crucial for improving health outcomes during heatwaves and addressing environmental resilience in the Central America dry corridor. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems and promoting clean cooking technologies, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve indoor air quality, and support sustainable livelihoods for smallholder farmers.
