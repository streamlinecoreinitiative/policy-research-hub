# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Sahel: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Sahel: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity, exacerbating climate-induced vulnerabilities such as droughts and floods. To address these gaps, we recommend investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, promoting renewable energy sources, and enhancing community-led solutions for sustainable water management.

**Key Findings:**

* Sub-Saharan Africa has a drinking water access rate of just 32.4%, with only 53.3% having reliable electricity (World Bank Open Data).
* These rates are crucial indicators of the region's vulnerability to climate change and health risks.
* Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure can reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups, such as fisheries in the Sahel.

**Recommendations:**

1. Invest in climate-resilient water infrastructure projects, such as drought-resistant wells and improved irrigation systems, to improve drinking water access rates.
2. Promote renewable energy sources, such as solar-powered mini-grids, to increase reliable electricity access for off-grid areas.
3. Enhance community-led solutions for sustainable water management, including community-based initiatives to manage small-scale water resources.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's natural environment is characterized by arid and semi-arid regions, making the region highly vulnerable to climate change (World Bank Open Data). The region faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and 53.3% having reliable electricity (World Bank Open Data).

## Analysis

The analysis reveals that Sub-Saharan Africa's low drinking water access rate (32.4%) highlights significant disparities between urban and rural areas, with rural areas disproportionately affected by power outages (World Bank Open Data). The region lags behind globally in renewable energy consumption (19.7%), indicating room for improvement in sustainable development strategies (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security:**
	* Integrate climate adaptation measures into water infrastructure projects, such as drought-resistant wells and improved irrigation systems.
	* Encourage community-based initiatives to manage small-scale water resources sustainably.
2. **Energy Access:**
	* Promote renewable energy sources, such as solar-powered mini-grids, for off-grid areas.
	* Increase the share of renewable energy consumption (e.g., solar) to meet current and future needs while reducing environmental impacts.

## Implementation Considerations

1. Conduct pilot projects in key regions to test climate-resilient water infrastructure and renewable energy solutions.
2. Collaborate with local NGOs and community groups to ensure sustainable implementation of these interventions.
3. Estimated costs for implementing climate-resilient water infrastructure (e.g., wells, mini-grids) range from $500-$1000 per household [VERIFY].
4. Potential challenges include limited funding, technical expertise, and community buy-in.

## Conclusion

Governments and development partners must prioritize climate-resilient infrastructure investments in Sub-Saharan Africa to enhance water security and energy access. Collaboration across sectors is essential for successful implementation. To address the urgent need for sustainable solutions, we recommend establishing a regional task force to oversee the development and execution of these policies.

**Call to Action:** Governments and development partners must invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, promote renewable energy sources, and enhance community-led solutions for sustainable water management to cut disaster losses for vulnerable groups in Sub-Saharan Africa.
