# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Environmental Resilience for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most populous and vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity, flooding, and cyclones. This brief outlines a strategy for watershed co-management with indigenous councils to enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries. By integrating clean energy, water security, and climate adaptation, this approach can reduce disaster losses and improve livelihoods for vulnerable communities.

## Current Water Scarcity and Climate Risks

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta experiences significant precipitation variability, with average annual rainfall ranging from 800 to 1200 mm [verify]. This erratic rainfall pattern affects agriculture, causing crop failures and reduced yields. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, consuming a significant amount of energy through borehole pumps.

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Local surveys and case studies have shown that agroforestry can increase:

* Soil Organic Matter by 2-8% [verify]
* Biodiversity by a significant number of native species (exact figure not specified)
* Carbon Sequestration by an unspecified amount

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, generating power in the range of 10-50 kW per system with an efficiency rate of 70-80%. These systems offer cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated solutions can provide cost-effective outcomes. A total project cost per hectare is estimated at $10,000-$25,000 [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years. Long-term sustainability assessments are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of these integrated systems.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Key recommendations include:

* Subsidies for farmers: Incentives provided to encourage adoption of integrated systems
* Grid integration: Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure development: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a comprehensive climate data analysis using NOAA datasets to inform watershed management decisions.
2.  Perform economic analyses of traditional irrigation costs and micro-hydro systems to determine cost-effectiveness.
3.  Conduct local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
4.  Develop policy measures, including subsidies for farmers, grid integration, and infrastructure development.

## Closing Outlook

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Watershed co-management with indigenous councils can enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries by integrating clean energy, water security, and climate adaptation. By implementing these integrated systems, disaster losses can be reduced, and livelihoods improved for vulnerable communities.
