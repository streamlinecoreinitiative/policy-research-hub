# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Great Lakes Region: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region faces significant water security challenges due to climate change and aging infrastructure. This brief highlights the importance of addressing water loss reduction through integrated approaches combining clean energy, climate adaptation, and resilience finance.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Great Lakes Region

Climate change leads to erratic rainfall patterns, exacerbating water scarcity in the region. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, perpetuating poverty among smallholder farmers.

*   **Climate Change Impacts:**
    *   [Verify] Average annual rainfall
    *   Precipitation variability (annual range of [verify])
*   **Water Loss Percentages from Traditional Irrigation Systems:**
    *   Evaporation: 30%
    *   Seepage: 5%

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating poverty among smallholder farmers. Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems experience significant water loss due to evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%).

*   **Description of Existing Irrigation Systems:**
    *   Borehole pumps: Energy consumption of [verify] kWh/day
    *   Canal systems: Water loss due to evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%)
*   **Economic Impact Assessment:**
    *   Cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods: $[verify]-$[verify]/year

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Specific data includes:

*   **Power Generation:** [Verify] kW per system
*   **Energy Efficiency:** [Verify]%
*   **Cost Savings Compared to Traditional Irrigation Methods:**

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. Cost estimates and financial viability analysis reveal:

*   **Total Project Cost:** $[verify]-$[verify] per hectare
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** [Verify] years
*   **Long-Term Sustainability Assessments:**

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions, while future research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability. Key policy recommendations include:

*   **Incentives for Farmers:** Subsidies, low-interest loans
*   **Grid Integration with Micro-Hydro Systems:**
*   **Infrastructure Development (Roads, Storage Facilities):**

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Develop a comprehensive water management plan** that incorporates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation.
2.  **Provide incentives and support** to farmers adopting integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Invest in infrastructure development**, including roads, storage facilities, and grid integration with micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

Addressing water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Great Lakes region requires a multi-faceted approach that combines clean energy, climate adaptation, and resilience finance. By implementing agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation, communities can reduce their reliance on traditional methods while promoting sustainable agriculture and renewable energy use.
