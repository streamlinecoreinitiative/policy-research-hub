**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Despite significant progress on safely managed drinking water (73.7% globally [1]), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water [2]. To address this critical issue, we recommend investing in renewable energy to expand electricity access by at least [VERIFY] percentage points within the next five years and implementing climate-resilient water supply infrastructure, such as rainwater harvesting and micro-dams.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to nearly half of the world's population lacking safe drinking water (2.2 billion people) [3]. Access to electricity remains low at 53.3%, with a significant portion still relying on traditional biomass for cooking [4]. Climate change exacerbates existing challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.

## Analysis

The World Bank reports that Sub-Saharan Africa withdraws nearly one-tenth of its freshwater resources annually (9.2% [5]). Electricity access is concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural populations without reliable power sources for heating, cooling, or powering essential services [6]. Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7%, far below global averages and necessary to meet climate goals [7].

## Policy Recommendations

### 1. Expand Renewable Energy

Prioritize investments in solar, wind, and hydropower projects to increase access to electricity across Sub-Saharan Africa. This will not only reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also create jobs and stimulate local economies.

### 2. Rainwater Harvesting and Micro-Dams

Implement cost-effective water harvesting systems for urban and peri-urban areas, focusing on micro-dams as a sustainable solution. These systems can provide a reliable source of clean water during droughts and floods.

### 3. Climate Resilient Infrastructure

Develop early warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure such as flood barriers, irrigation canals, and drought-resistant crops. This will help communities adapt to the impacts of climate change and reduce vulnerability to natural disasters.

## Implementation Considerations

The estimated costs for these recommendations are substantial: $10 billion for renewable energy projects over five years [8]. However, collaboration with international partners and development funds can help overcome financial constraints. Technical expertise and regulatory frameworks may also require support from external actors.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is critical for sustainable development and improved quality of life. Immediate action is needed to ensure that vulnerable populations have the resources they need to thrive under current and future climate conditions. We urge policymakers and stakeholders to prioritize these recommendations and work together to build a more resilient and sustainable future.
