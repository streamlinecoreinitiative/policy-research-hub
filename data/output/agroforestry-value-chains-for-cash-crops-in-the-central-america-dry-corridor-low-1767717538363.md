# Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Central America Dry Corridor: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, with severe water scarcity and droughts affecting agricultural productivity and food security. This brief presents an integrated approach to address these challenges through agroforestry value chains for cash crops.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity in the Central America dry corridor, impacting agriculture and food security. The region experiences erratic rainfall patterns, with average annual rainfall ranging from 800-1200 mm [verify]. Precipitation variability ranges from 600-1400 mm, making it challenging for farmers to predict and manage water resources.

### Traditional Irrigation Practices

Traditional irrigation methods in the Central America dry corridor are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy, while canal systems experience losses due to evaporation and seepage [verify]. An economic analysis of traditional irrigation costs is needed to understand the financial burden on farmers.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Studies indicate that agroforestry can increase:

* Soil organic matter by 2-8% [verify]
* Biodiversity by 15-30 native species [verify]
* Carbon sequestration by 3-7 tons/ha/year [verify]

Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from agroforestry are needed to validate these findings.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, generating power ranging from 10-50 kW per system. These systems achieve an energy efficiency of 70-80% [verify] and offer significant cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a cost-effective solution for climate-resilient water supply. Estimated costs range from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Recommendations include:

* Subsidies for farmers to encourage adoption
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure development, including roads, storage facilities, and other improvements

## Actions/Recommendations List

1. Conduct an economic analysis of traditional irrigation costs.
2. Validate the benefits of agroforestry through local surveys and case studies.
3. Develop policy measures to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The Central America dry corridor faces significant challenges related to water scarcity, droughts, and climate change. Agroforestry value chains for cash crops offer a promising solution by integrating sustainable agriculture practices with renewable energy generation. By adopting this approach, farmers can improve irrigation efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and increase crop yields while sequestering carbon.
