# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Mekong basin: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Mekong Basin: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Mekong basin is one of the world's most critical regions for agricultural production, providing a significant portion of Asia's food and income. However, climate change is exacerbating droughts, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events, posing severe threats to human health and livelihoods. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry value chains for cash crops in improving health outcomes during heatwaves, focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Context and Challenges**

The Mekong basin is home to over 60 million people, with agriculture being a vital sector that supports the livelihoods of millions. Climate change is projected to worsen droughts, heatwaves, and floods, negatively impacting agricultural productivity, food security, and human health. The region's water scarcity and changing precipitation patterns are also affecting the availability of clean energy sources.

**Key Challenges:**

• **Water Security:** Insufficient access to reliable water sources for irrigation and household use.
• **Clean Energy:** Limited availability of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.
• **Climate Adaptation:** Inadequate infrastructure and institutional capacity to respond to extreme weather events.

**Agroforestry Value Chains: A Solution for Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry value chains can play a crucial role in improving the resilience of smallholder farmers to climate-related shocks. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, these systems can:

• **Enhance Water Security:** Increase water retention and reduce soil erosion.
• **Promote Clean Energy:** Provide opportunities for renewable energy generation through solar or wind power.
• **Support Climate Adaptation:** Offer a range of ecosystem services, including shade, shelter, and soil conservation.

**Case Studies:**

• **Mekong Delta, Vietnam:** A successful agroforestry project has improved farmers' livelihoods by increasing crop yields and reducing water usage.
• **Cambodia:** A community-led initiative has implemented agroforestry practices to enhance biodiversity and improve climate resilience.

**Implementation Challenges and Solutions**

While agroforestry value chains offer significant benefits, their implementation is often hindered by:

• **Limited Infrastructure:** Inadequate roads, storage facilities, and market access.
• **Low Literacy Rates:** Difficulty in communicating complex information about climate risks and adaptation strategies.
• **Lack of Institutional Capacity:** Insufficient support from local authorities and extension services.

**Solutions:**

• **Capacity Building:** Provide training for farmers on agroforestry practices and climate-resilient agriculture.
• **Infrastructure Development:** Invest in roads, storage facilities, and market access to improve the efficiency of value chains.
• **Community Engagement:** Foster partnerships between farmers, local authorities, and extension services to promote collective action.

**Policy Recommendations**

Governments and international organizations can support the development and implementation of agroforestry value chains by:

• **Providing Financial Support:** Allocate funding for infrastructure development, capacity building, and climate-resilient agriculture initiatives.
• **Promoting Policy Frameworks:** Develop policies that encourage sustainable land-use practices, renewable energy generation, and climate adaptation.
• **Fostering Community Engagement:** Encourage partnerships between farmers, local authorities, and extension services to promote collective action.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Support the development of agroforestry value chains in the Mekong basin through financial assistance and capacity building programs.
2. Promote policy frameworks that encourage sustainable land-use practices, renewable energy generation, and climate adaptation.
3. Foster community engagement and partnerships between farmers, local authorities, and extension services to promote collective action.

**Closing Outlook**

The agroforestry value chain approach offers a promising solution for improving health outcomes in heatwaves by enhancing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of this approach make it an essential consideration for policymakers and practitioners working in the Mekong basin.
