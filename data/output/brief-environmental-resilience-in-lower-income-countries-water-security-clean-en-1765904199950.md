# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Harnessing Renewable Energy to Secure Water Supplies: A Case Study from Sub-Saharan Africa**

**Executive Summary**

Sub-Saharan African countries face significant challenges in securing both clean water and energy, which are crucial for economic development and public health. This brief highlights the interdependence of these resources and the potential for renewable energy solutions to address multiple environmental issues simultaneously. Through a case study on the use of solar, wind, and hydro power for water management, this report demonstrates that investing in renewable energy can stimulate local economies, reduce poverty, and improve water security.

**Renewable Energy as a Solution**

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to over 40% of the world's population without access to electricity (UN Water). The region faces significant challenges in securing both clean water and energy. Traditional fossil fuels are often expensive, unreliable, and have negative environmental impacts. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power offer a cleaner, more sustainable alternative.

* Solar power: Abundant sunlight makes solar power an attractive option for many Sub-Saharan African countries.
* Wind power: Wind turbines can be used to generate electricity in areas with high wind speeds.
* Hydro power: Hydroelectric power plants can provide reliable and renewable energy while also managing water resources effectively.

**Case Study: Renewable Energy for Water Security**

Several projects have successfully harnessed renewable energy to manage water resources effectively in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example:

* The **Kenya Off-Grid Solar Power Project** has provided clean energy to over 10,000 households, reducing reliance on diesel generators and improving water management.
* The **South African Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement (REIPPP) Program** has invested in solar and wind power projects that generate electricity while also managing water resources effectively.
* The **Ethiopia Mini-Grid Electrification Project** has used hydro power to provide clean energy to rural communities, improving access to water and sanitation.

These projects demonstrate the potential for renewable energy solutions to address multiple environmental issues simultaneously.

**Economic Impacts**

Investing in renewable energy can have significant economic benefits for local communities. For example:

* Renewable energy investments can create employment opportunities, stimulate local economies, and reduce poverty.
* Studies have shown that every dollar invested in renewable energy generates an average of $3-4 in economic returns (IRENA).
* In addition to economic benefits, renewable energy projects can also improve public health by reducing air pollution from fossil fuels.

**Challenges and Solutions**

Despite the potential benefits, there are several challenges to implementing renewable energy solutions for water management. These include:

* High upfront costs: Renewable energy technologies can be expensive to install.
* Policy and regulatory barriers: Inadequate policies and regulations can hinder investment in renewable energy projects.
* Community engagement: Building trust with local communities is essential for successful project implementation.

To overcome these challenges, policymakers can support the development of renewable energy projects through:

* Policy support: Implementing policies that incentivize investment in renewable energy technologies.
* Community engagement: Engaging with local communities to build trust and ensure successful project implementation.
* Capacity building: Providing training and capacity-building programs for local stakeholders.

**Actions/Recommendations**

Based on this case study, we recommend that policymakers:

1. Invest in renewable energy projects that integrate water management solutions.
2. Develop policies and regulations that support the development of renewable energy technologies.
3. Engage with local communities to build trust and ensure successful project implementation.
4. Provide training and capacity-building programs for local stakeholders.

**Closing Outlook**

Harnessing renewable energy to secure water supplies is a critical step towards achieving sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By investing in renewable energy solutions, policymakers can address multiple environmental issues simultaneously, stimulate local economies, reduce poverty, and improve public health. We hope that this case study will inform policy decisions and inspire further investment in renewable energy projects for water management.

**Data Gaps**

This brief highlights several data gaps that need to be addressed through further research:

* Detailed cost-benefit analyses of renewable energy projects in water management.
* Long-term economic impact studies on local communities post-project implementation.
* Comparative case studies from other regions to understand best practices and lessons learned.
