# mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance in the Sahel: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing critical challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. According to the World Bank (2024), 73.7% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, while only 53.3% have access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data]. To address these interconnected crises, we recommend prioritizing renewable energy projects for electrification, investing in climate-smart agricultural practices to improve soil health and water management, and implementing community-based water management initiatives.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts, including droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall patterns [IPCC AR6]. These factors have led to reduced access to clean drinking water and electricity. The lack of access to safe drinking water and reliable energy sources not only threatens public health but also hinders economic growth and sustainable development.

## Analysis

### Electricity Access

Despite progress, Sub-Saharan Africa still struggles with electricity access. In 2023, only [VERIFY] % of the population had access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% of total final energy consumption in the region (World Bank, 2020), far below global averages and required targets for climate resilience.

### Water Security

Only 73.7% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data]. This is a significant gap considering that 2.2 billion people globally lack safe water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

### Climate Resilience

Sub-Saharan Africa's climate resilience efforts are hindered by limited access to finance and technology. The region requires $5.8-5.9 trillion in annual climate finance by 2030 (UNFCCC, 2021) to achieve its development goals.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

### Electricity Access

* **Invest in Renewable Energy Projects**: Develop and finance solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects to increase access.
	+ Initial investment costs for renewable energy projects can range from $10,000 to $50,000 per project [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Support Microgrids**: Implement microgrid solutions that provide reliable electricity to rural areas where grid extension is not feasible.
* **Energy Efficiency Standards**: Introduce standards for energy-efficient appliances and lighting to reduce overall demand.

### Water Security

* **Community-Based Water Management Initiatives**: Establish community-led water management committees to improve local water sources and distribution systems.
	+ Community-led water management initiatives cost approximately $2,000-$5,000 per community program [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Rainwater Harvesting Ponds**: Implement rainwater harvesting ponds to collect and store rainfall, reducing dependency on unreliable surface water sources.
* **Climate-Smart Agriculture**: Promote climate-smart agricultural practices that enhance soil health and water retention.

### Climate Resilience

* **Adaptation Strategies**: Develop and implement adaptation strategies such as early warning systems for extreme weather events.
* **Green Infrastructure**: Invest in green infrastructure like mangrove restoration to protect coastal areas from rising sea levels and storm surges.
* **Capacity Building**: Train local communities and government officials on climate resilience planning and management.

## Implementation Considerations

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that combines technological solutions with community engagement. Potential barriers include:

* **Political and Institutional Constraints**: Securing political support for climate-resilient infrastructure projects can be challenging.
* **Funding Shortfalls**: Limited access to concessional funding from international donors hinders large-scale implementation.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a comprehensive policy approach that leverages available resources and innovative solutions. By prioritizing renewable energy projects, innovative water management strategies, and climate-resilient infrastructure, we can significantly improve the lives of millions of vulnerable individuals and communities.
