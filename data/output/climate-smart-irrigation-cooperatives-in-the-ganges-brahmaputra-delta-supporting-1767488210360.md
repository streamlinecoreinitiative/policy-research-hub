# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and ecologically sensitive regions in South Asia, facing severe climate-related challenges. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme events threaten agricultural productivity, water security, and human well-being. This brief explores the potential of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a solution to support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in lower-income countries like Bangladesh.

**Climate Change Impacts in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

The region is characterized by:

* Average annual rainfall: [verify] mm
* Precipitation variability (annual range of 600-1400 mm)
* Water loss percentages from traditional irrigation systems:
	+ Evaporation: 30%
	+ Seepage: 5%

Climate change exacerbates these challenges, with projected increases in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods, such as borehole pumps and canal systems, are energy-intensive and economically burdensome:

* Borehole pumps: Energy consumption of [verify] kWh/day
* Canal systems: Water loss due to evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%)
* Cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods: $[verify]-$200/year

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**

The proposed solution integrates agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, providing sustainable and renewable energy solutions:

* Benefits of agroforestry:
	+ Soil organic matter: [verify]%
	+ Biodiversity increase: [verify]%
	+ Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year
* Micro-hydro systems provide:
	+ Power generation: 10-50 kW per system (estimated)
	+ Energy efficiency: 70-80% (estimated)

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the implementation of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, we recommend:

1. Incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans)
2. Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
3. Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research should focus on:

* Long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions
* Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop a supportive policy environment**: Governments and international organizations should provide incentives for farmers to adopt climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.
2. **Invest in infrastructure development**: Roads, storage facilities, and grid integration with micro-hydro systems are essential for the success of these initiatives.
3. **Conduct further research and monitoring**: Long-term sustainability assessments and local surveys will help refine the approach and ensure its effectiveness.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives have the potential to address severe water scarcity challenges in lower-income countries like Bangladesh, supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions that improve agricultural productivity, water security, and human well-being.
