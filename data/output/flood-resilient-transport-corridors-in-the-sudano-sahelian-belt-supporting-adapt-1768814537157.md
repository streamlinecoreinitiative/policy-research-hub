# Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing significant challenges in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. This brief highlights the importance of flood-resilient transport corridors in supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for countries in this region.

## Current Situation Analysis

### Water Security Challenges in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

*   The Sudano-Sahelian belt is characterized by limited access to clean energy, inadequate irrigation systems, and high population growth rates.
*   Climate change impacts exacerbate existing water scarcity challenges, threatening food security and economic development.
*   Unsustainable agricultural practices contribute to soil degradation, reducing crop yields and further straining water resources.

### Existing Irrigation Systems and Limitations

*   Traditional irrigation methods are often inefficient, wasting significant amounts of water due to poor design or inadequate maintenance.
*   High operational costs and limited access to electricity hinder the adoption of more efficient micro-hydro systems.
*   Socio-economic factors, such as poverty and lack of education, contribute to the persistence of unsustainable agricultural practices.

## Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors: A Solution for Climate Adaptation

### Agroforestry's Role in Enhancing Water Security

*   Agroforestry practices have been shown to enhance soil fertility, improve water retention, and promote biodiversity.
*   Successful case studies demonstrate the integration of agroforestry with traditional irrigation methods, providing sustainable water management solutions.
*   Potential synergies between agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can further enhance overall system efficiency and sustainability.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficient Water Management

*   Micro-hydro technology offers low capital costs, high reliability, and minimal environmental impact.
*   Successful implementation of micro-hydro projects has been demonstrated in various regions, showcasing the potential for scalability.
*   Integration with agroforestry practices can improve overall system efficiency and sustainability.

## Supporting Adaptation Targets through Integrated Approaches

### Climate-Resilient Water Supply Systems

*   Integrated approaches that combine agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can contribute to climate resilience by promoting drought-resistant crops, improving water management practices, and enhancing ecosystem services.
*   Successful case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of these integrated approaches in supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

*   Governments should prioritize policies that support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, such as providing incentives for private sector investment or offering training programs for farmers.
*   Further research is needed to improve system design, cost-effectiveness, and impact, focusing on areas such as:
    *   Scaling up successful pilot projects
    *   Developing more efficient micro-hydro technologies
    *   Enhancing the resilience of agroforestry systems to climate-related shocks

## Closing Outlook

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is facing significant challenges in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. By leveraging flood-resilient transport corridors and integrated approaches that combine agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can address these challenges and support the achievement of adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Prioritize policy support**: Governments should provide incentives for private sector investment, offer training programs for farmers, and develop policies that promote the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Invest in further research**: Focus on scaling up successful pilot projects, developing more efficient micro-hydro technologies, and enhancing the resilience of agroforestry systems to climate-related shocks.
3.  **Enhance stakeholder collaboration**: Encourage partnerships between governments, NGOs, private sector entities, and local communities to implement these solutions on a larger scale.

By working together to address water scarcity and poverty through integrated solutions, we can ensure sustainable economic benefits for the people of the Sudano-Sahelian belt and support the achievement of adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.
