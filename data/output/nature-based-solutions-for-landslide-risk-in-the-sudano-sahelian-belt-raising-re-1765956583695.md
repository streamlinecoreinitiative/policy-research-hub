# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: raising resilience finance for communities

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent droughts and extreme weather events exacerbating existing environmental challenges. This brief focuses on three key areas: micro-insurance for livestock farmers in the Horn of Africa, climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Central America dry corridor, and nature-based solutions for landslide risk management. By exploring innovative approaches to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation, this report aims to raise resilience finance for communities in lower-income countries.

**Section 1: Micro-Insurance for Livestock Farmers in the Horn of Africa**

The Horn of Africa is experiencing severe climate-related shocks, including droughts and extreme weather events, which have devastating impacts on livestock farmers. Micro-insurance can provide a critical buffer against economic shocks, supporting farmers' livelihoods while promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

* **Introduction**: The Horn of Africa's climate resilience challenges are exacerbated by increasing temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events.
* **Current Livestock Insurance Mechanisms**: Existing insurance schemes in the region have limited coverage, high premiums, and inadequate risk management strategies.
* **Impact of Micro-Insurance**: Successful pilot programs demonstrate reduced financial stress for farmers, improved resource management, and enhanced food security.
* **Evidence-Based Success Stories**: Case studies from Ethiopia and Kenya highlight scalability potential and policy implications.

**Key Data Points Needed**

* Number of livestock covered under micro-insurance schemes
* Reduction percentage in farmer suicides/migration due to micro-insurance coverage
* Total cost savings and economic benefits to the agricultural sector annually

**Official Sources**

* UN FAO reports on livestock insurance practices globally
* World Bank climate change adaptation projects focusing on livestock management
* OECD analysis of successful micro-insurance programs in developing countries

**Data Gaps**

* Detailed breakdowns of costs and benefits specific to the Horn of Africa context
* Long-term sustainability metrics for micro-insurance schemes over multiple seasons or years
* Comparative effectiveness data between different livestock types under various climate conditions

**Section 2: Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Central America Dry Corridor**

The Central America dry corridor is facing increasing water scarcity and variability due to climate change. By fostering cooperative irrigation systems, communities can better manage their limited resources sustainably.

* **Introduction**: The region's drought-prone agriculture poses significant challenges to food security and livelihoods.
* **Existing Irrigation Cooperatives**: Description of existing cooperatives and their effectiveness in managing water resources.
* **Benefits of Climate-Smart Practices**: Water harvesting, drip irrigation, and efficient fertilizer use can significantly improve crop yields while reducing water waste.
* **Success Stories from Cooperative Models**: Case studies from Guatemala and Honduras demonstrate the potential for scaling up climate-resilient irrigation systems.

**Key Data Points Needed**

* Number of farmers participating in cooperatives and their average yield improvements
* Cost savings from reduced water use and improved fertilizer efficiency
* Farmer participation rate and overall satisfaction levels with cooperative models

**Official Sources**

* National Meteorological Services for climate change projections relevant to the region
* World Bank Agricultural Sector Development projects in the dry corridor
* FAO reports on best practices in sustainable water management

**Data Gaps**

* Detailed cost-benefit analysis of transitioning from traditional irrigation methods to cooperative models
* Long-term effects on soil health and biodiversity within cooperative systems
* Impact on rural employment levels and community development outcomes

**Section 3: Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk Management**

Landslides pose significant risks to communities in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, often caused by deforestation, soil erosion, and climate-related events. Nature-based solutions can provide effective mitigation strategies.

* **Introduction**: The region's landslide risk is exacerbated by environmental degradation and climate change.
* **Nature-Based Solutions**: Description of innovative approaches, such as reforestation, soil conservation, and eco-engineering.
* **Case Studies**: Successful pilot projects in Burkina Faso and Mali demonstrate the potential for scaling up nature-based solutions.

**Key Data Points Needed**

* Number of communities benefiting from nature-based solutions
* Reduction percentage in landslide frequency and severity
* Total cost savings and economic benefits to affected communities

**Official Sources**

* UN Environment Programme reports on nature-based solutions globally
* World Bank climate change adaptation projects focusing on environmental conservation
* FAO reports on sustainable land management practices

**Data Gaps**

* Detailed breakdowns of costs and benefits specific to the Sudano-Sahelian belt context
* Long-term sustainability metrics for nature-based solutions over multiple seasons or years
* Comparative effectiveness data between different nature-based approaches under various climate conditions

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Integrate Micro-Insurance into National Agricultural Development Strategies**: Governments should incorporate micro-insurance mechanisms into national agricultural development plans to support farmers' livelihoods.
2. **Scale Up Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: International organizations and governments should invest in scaling up cooperative irrigation systems, promoting climate-resilient agriculture practices.
3. **Implement Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk Management**: Governments and international organizations should prioritize nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and soil conservation, to mitigate landslide risks.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent droughts and extreme weather events exacerbating existing environmental challenges. By exploring innovative approaches to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation, this report aims to raise resilience finance for communities in lower-income countries. The key takeaways from this brief are:

* Micro-insurance can provide a critical buffer against economic shocks for livestock farmers in the Horn of Africa.
* Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives can improve crop yields while reducing water waste in the Central America dry corridor.
* Nature-based solutions can effectively mitigate landslide risks in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.

By implementing these innovative approaches, governments and international organizations can support communities in building resilience to climate-related shocks, ultimately contributing to sustainable development and poverty reduction.
