# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, affecting water security, clean energy access, and food production. This brief highlights the importance of transitioning peri-urban households towards cleaner cooking practices by integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change has severe impacts on agriculture in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from vast wetlands. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers in vulnerable communities.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems suffer from high water loss through evaporation and seepage. These methods often rely on diesel generators that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems offer numerous benefits, including improved soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry systems enhance water retention and reduce erosion.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology provides an efficient and renewable source of energy for irrigation. By harnessing the power of small-scale hydroelectric systems, peri-urban households can reduce their reliance on diesel generators and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. These integrated solutions enhance water security and provide a sustainable source of energy, reducing costs and emissions.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems at scale:

1.  **Develop policies that incentivize investment in renewable energy sources**.
2.  Establish training programs for smallholder farmers on climate-resilient irrigation methods.
3.  Provide financial assistance for peri-urban households to transition towards cleaner cooking practices.

## Future Research Directions

To further validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, research should focus on:

1.  **Economic impact analysis**: Assessing the cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.
2.  Socioeconomic studies: Examining community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.

## Actions/Recommendations

*   Develop policies that incentivize investment in renewable energy sources
*   Establish training programs for smallholder farmers on climate-resilient irrigation methods
*   Provide financial assistance for peri-urban households to transition towards cleaner cooking practices

## Closing Outlook

The clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Sudano-Sahelian belt is a critical sector that requires immediate attention. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can provide a sustainable solution to water security and renewable energy access, enhancing food production and economic stability.
