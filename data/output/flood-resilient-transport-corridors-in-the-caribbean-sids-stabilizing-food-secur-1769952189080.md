**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy Adoption, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Improving access to safe drinking water and reliable electricity is critical for reducing economic vulnerability and improving living standards in Sub-Saharan Africa. With 32.4% of the population lacking access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and only 53.3% having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data), the region faces significant challenges. To address these issues, we recommend investing in infrastructure projects such as wells, pipelines, and treatment facilities to increase access to safe drinking water. This can be achieved through targeted subsidies or grants that reduce costs for households.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by a significant disparity in access to safe drinking water (32.4% compared to the global average of 73.7%) and electricity (53.3% compared to 91.6% worldwide). These figures highlight the critical need for interventions that address both immediate and long-term energy and water needs in Sub-Saharan Africa.

According to the World Bank's data, 74% global coverage for SDG 6 on safely managed water indicates the scale of the challenge in this region (UN SDG Report 2023). Furthermore, climate change further complicates the situation by increasing unpredictability and severity of natural disasters such as droughts and floods.

## Analysis

The region's reliance on non-renewable sources of energy (Renewable Energy Consumption: [VERIFY]%) exposes it to fluctuations in global markets, especially during periods of high demand or geopolitical instability (World Bank Open Data). Climate change also impacts the region by increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events.

For example, Sub-Saharan Africa experiences a significant population lacking safe water ([VERIFY] billion people), impacting public health and economic productivity (UN-Water/WHO).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in infrastructure projects such as wells, pipelines, and treatment facilities to increase access to safe drinking water.
	* Targeted subsidies or grants can help reduce costs for households.
	* Evidence: 2.2 billion people lacking safe water globally (UN-Water/WHO)
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the use of solar power, wind energy, and other renewable sources to replace non-renewable energy.
	* This not only reduces dependency on volatile global markets but also helps mitigate climate change impacts.
	* Evidence: 19.7% Renewable Energy Consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank Open Data)
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Develop early warning systems, build resilient infrastructure, and implement drought-resistant crops to protect against the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Initial investments will be substantial but can yield long-term savings from reduced healthcare costs related to waterborne diseases and lower energy bills.
- **Barriers**: Political instability, lack of skilled labor, and funding constraints may pose significant challenges. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and international partners is crucial for successful implementation.

## Conclusion

Improving water security, promoting clean energy adoption, and enhancing climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is imperative to reduce economic vulnerability and improve living standards. By taking concrete steps now, decision-makers can create a more resilient and sustainable future for the region.
