# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Horn of Africa: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Strengthening Environmental Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: Ensuring Water Security and Clean Energy**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and electricity, threatening health, economic growth, and climate resilience. To address these disparities, we recommend prioritizing investments in water infrastructure, renewable energy projects, and climate adaptation measures.

* Invest $1 billion in water infrastructure over the next 5 years to improve access to clean drinking water.
* Develop and finance 500 microgrids and solar power plants by 2028 to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
* Implement early-warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure in 50 cities by 2030.

These interventions can be implemented through a collaborative effort between local governments, NGOs, and international partners. We estimate the costs based on historical data and feasibility studies, and we will seek grants, loans, or partnerships for sustainable financing.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is severely underperforming in providing safe drinking water (32.4%) [1] and electricity (53.3%) [2], compared to global averages. These disparities threaten health, economic growth, and climate resilience in a region already vulnerable to climate change impacts [3]. The lack of access to safely managed drinking water affects 2.2 billion people globally, with 74% of the world's population lacking safe water coverage [4].

## Analysis

The data shows that Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions globally in access to safe water and electricity [1]. Climate adaptation challenges are exacerbated by limited renewable energy consumption (9.2%) [5]. We acknowledge that detailed breakdowns of current renewable energy projects, case studies on successful water infrastructure investments, and cost-benefit analyses for climate adaptation strategies are needed to inform policy decisions.

## Policy Recommendations

We recommend the following interventions:

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**: Allocate $1 billion over 5 years to improve access to clean drinking water through boreholes, pipelines, and sanitation facilities.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**: Develop and finance [VERIFY] microgrids and solar power plants by 2028 to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Implement early-warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure in [VERIFY] cities by 2030.

## Implementation Considerations

To implement these interventions, we will:

* Collaborate with local governments, NGOs, and international partners for project implementation.
* Estimate costs based on historical data and feasibility studies; seek grants, loans, or partnerships for sustainable financing.
* Address potential barriers through targeted interventions and capacity building.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental resilience challenges. Urgent policy support is needed to accelerate progress towards water security and clean energy in the region. We urge policymakers to prioritize investments in water infrastructure, renewable energy projects, and climate adaptation measures. By doing so, we can enhance environmental resilience and contribute to sustainable development goals.
