**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary
This policy brief highlights the need to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis reveals that [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population lacks access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), while only [VERIFY] 53.3% has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data). To address these challenges, we recommend implementing cost-effective water supply solutions, scaling up renewable energy projects, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant development challenges due to inadequate access to safe drinking water and electricity. According to the World Bank Open Data, [NEEDS SOURCE] 73.7% of the world's population lacks safe water (UN-Water/WHO), making this issue a pressing concern for public health and sustainable development. The region's reliance on fossil fuels is also exacerbating climate change impacts, including droughts and floods.

## Analysis
Our analysis reveals that:

* Access to safely managed drinking water remains low in Sub-Saharan Africa, with [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population lacking access (World Bank Open Data).
* Only [VERIFY] 53.3% of the population has access to electricity, limiting economic opportunities and quality of life (World Bank Open Data).
* Renewable energy consumption is far below global averages, at [NEEDS SOURCE] 19.7% (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Supply Solutions**:
	* Implement cost-effective water supply solutions like rainwater harvesting systems and solar-powered wells to improve access to safe drinking water in rural areas.
	* Deploy mobile water purification units for remote communities.
	* Cost Estimate: [NEEDS SOURCE]
2. **Scale Up Renewable Energy Projects**:
	* Invest in renewable energy projects such as microgrids and solar-powered irrigation systems to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, thereby improving electricity access and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
	* Establish a green fund for clean energy initiatives targeting rural areas.
	* Cost Estimate: [NEEDS SOURCE]
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Strategies**:
	* Promote climate-resilient agriculture through agroforestry value chains and other sustainable practices to protect livelihoods from the impacts of climate change, including droughts and floods.
	* Develop climate-smart agricultural extension services for farmers.
	* Cost Estimate: [NEEDS SOURCE]

## Implementation Considerations
To implement these recommendations, we recommend:

* Allocating limited resources effectively using public-private partnerships (PPP) to leverage additional funding from international donors.
* Building political will through awareness campaigns and aligning climate adaptation strategies with national development plans.
* Involving local communities in decision-making processes for sustainable water management and energy solutions.

## Conclusion
Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is essential for the socio-economic well-being of Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing these recommendations, we can create a more resilient future where vulnerable populations are better prepared to withstand environmental shocks.
