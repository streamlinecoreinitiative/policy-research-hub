**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

Executive Summary:

The Horn of Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to drought, climate change, and food insecurity. This brief highlights the importance of micro-insurance as a tool to support smallholder farmers in adapting to drought risks and achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) targets. By leveraging traditional indigenous knowledge and modern technologies, we can enhance water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries.

**Section 1: Introduction to the Importance of Indigenous Knowledge in Climate Resilience**

The Andean region's unique cultural heritage and traditional knowledge have allowed communities to manage watersheds sustainably for centuries. However, the impact of climate change has disrupted these practices, exacerbating water scarcity and increasing extreme weather events. By recognizing the value of indigenous knowledge, we can develop innovative solutions that combine traditional practices with modern technologies.

**Key Points:**

• Traditional indigenous techniques have historically managed up to [NEEDS VERIFICATION] percentage of total water resources in the Andes.
• Indigenous communities possess valuable knowledge on sustainable watershed management, including agroforestry and reforestation practices.
• Climate change has disrupted these traditional practices, leading to increased water scarcity and extreme weather events.

**Section 2: Current Challenges in Andean Watershed Management**

Climate change is having a profound impact on the Andean region's water resources and traditional management practices. Erratic rainfall patterns, increasing temperatures, and changing precipitation seasons are altering the hydrological cycle, exacerbating droughts and floods. This has significant implications for local communities, who rely heavily on water for agriculture, drinking, and sanitation.

**Key Points:**

• Climate change is projected to increase by up to [NEEDS VERIFICATION]% in the Andean region by 2050.
• Droughts and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, affecting up to [NEEDS VERIFICATION] communities annually.
• Traditional water management practices are being disrupted, leading to increased water scarcity and decreased agricultural productivity.

**Section 3: Indigenous-led Solutions for Climate-Resilient Watershed Management**

Indigenous-led initiatives have shown promising results in enhancing water security and resilience among local communities. These projects combine traditional knowledge with modern technologies like agroforestry, reforestation, and sustainable farming techniques.

**Key Points:**

• Up to [NEEDS VERIFICATION] indigenous-led projects have been implemented in the Andean region, demonstrating improved water availability and reduced erosion.
• Economic impact assessments indicate that these initiatives can generate up to [NEEDS VERIFICATION]% increase in local income through ecotourism, agribusinesses, and sustainable forestry practices.
• Government support for such programs is essential for long-term sustainability.

**Section 4: Next Steps for Scaling Up Successful Models**

To scale up successful watershed management models across the Andean region or globally, we recommend:

* Collaborating with indigenous groups to develop tailored solutions that respect local knowledge and traditions
* Providing technical and financial assistance to support the implementation of climate-resilient watershed management practices
* Encouraging policy makers to adopt supportive policies and regulations that recognize the value of indigenous knowledge

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support indigenous-led initiatives**: Provide funding, technical assistance, and capacity building for indigenous communities to develop and implement climate-resilient watershed management practices.
2. **Develop tailored solutions**: Collaborate with local stakeholders to design and implement solutions that respect traditional knowledge and address specific community needs.
3. **Promote policy advocacy**: Engage with government officials, civil society organizations, and the private sector to advocate for policies that support indigenous-led initiatives.

**Closing Outlook:**

The Horn of Africa's smallholder farmers are among the most vulnerable to drought risks and climate change. By leveraging micro-insurance as a tool to support adaptation efforts, we can enhance water security, clean energy, and climate resilience in lower-income countries. It is crucial to recognize the value of indigenous knowledge and work collaboratively with local communities to develop innovative solutions that address their specific needs.
