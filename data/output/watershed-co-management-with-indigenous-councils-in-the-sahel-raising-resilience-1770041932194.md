# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sahel: raising resilience finance for communities

**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Sahel: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces critical water scarcity issues, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). Additionally, only 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data), exacerbating economic and health challenges. Climate change intensifies these vulnerabilities, making it imperative to implement comprehensive policies that address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience simultaneously.

To address this challenge, we recommend implementing sustainable water management strategies, promoting renewable energy adoption, and enhancing community resilience through watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sahel region. This approach will require a collaborative effort among governments, NGOs, and international organizations to invest [VERIFY] for water infrastructure improvements and [VERIFY] for renewable energy projects.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing severe water scarcity issues due to increasing population growth, urbanization, and climate change (World Bank Open Data). The region's freshwater withdrawal rate stands at 9.2% of available resources (World Bank Open Data), indicating significant resource depletion. Moreover, only about half of the population has access to electricity (53.3%), with uneven distribution exacerbating economic and health challenges.

Climate change is further intensifying these vulnerabilities by increasing the frequency of droughts and floods. According to NOAA's climate data, the Sahel region is particularly vulnerable to climate-related disasters. It is essential to develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters and invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood barriers and water storage facilities.

## Analysis

The analysis reveals that Sub-Saharan Africa has a freshwater withdrawal rate of 9.2% (World Bank Open Data), significantly higher than the global average. The region's electricity access is also unevenly distributed, with only about half of the population having reliable power supply (53.3%) (World Bank Open Data). Renewable energy consumption in the region stands at just over 19% of total final energy consumption (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

### Enhance Water Security

* Invest in water harvesting and storage systems to improve access to safe drinking water.
* Implement cost-effective filtration technologies in rural areas.

### Promote Clean Energy Access

* Encourage grid extension and off-grid solar solutions to increase electrification rates, particularly focusing on remote communities with high demand for energy.

### Build Climate Resilience

* Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters (droughts and floods) and invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood barriers and water storage facilities.

## Implementation Considerations

Practical steps include developing detailed implementation plans, engaging local communities, and ensuring sustainable financing mechanisms. Potential costs range from [VERIFY] for water infrastructure improvements to [VERIFY] for renewable energy projects. Barriers could arise due to high initial investment needs and resistance from traditional power providers.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water scarcity issues, exacerbated by climate change. To address this challenge, we recommend implementing sustainable water management strategies, promoting renewable energy adoption, and enhancing community resilience through watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sahel region. A collaborative effort among governments, NGOs, and international organizations is necessary to invest [VERIFY] for water infrastructure improvements and [VERIFY] for renewable energy projects.

We urge governments, NGOs, and international organizations to take immediate action to implement these recommendations effectively within the next year. Establishing a multi-stakeholder task force to oversee implementation and monitoring progress will be crucial in achieving this goal.
