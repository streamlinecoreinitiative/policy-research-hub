# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Central America dry corridor: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Central America Dry Corridor: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing frequent droughts and heatwaves that exacerbate water scarcity issues. In secondary cities within this region, water loss reduction strategies are crucial for improving health outcomes during heatwaves. This brief highlights the importance of implementing biodiverse terracing systems in Ethiopia's highlands as a solution for dual-water security and climate adaptation.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Security in Ethiopian Highlands**

The Ethiopian highlands face significant water scarcity challenges, with an estimated 70% of the population relying on rain-fed agriculture. Climate change has exacerbated these issues, leading to more frequent droughts and heatwaves. Maintaining biodiversity is critical for water security, as it enhances soil moisture retention and improves ecosystem services.

Water scarcity in Ethiopia's highlands has severe consequences, including:

• Reduced crop yields and food insecurity
• Decreased access to clean drinking water
• Increased risk of water-borne diseases

Biodiverse terracing systems can help mitigate these effects by:

• Enhancing soil moisture retention through mulching and cover cropping
• Promoting local biodiversity through agroforestry practices
• Improving ecosystem services, such as pollination and pest control

**Section 2: Biodiverse Terracing Systems as a Solution**

Biodiverse terraces are designed to mimic natural ecosystems by incorporating diverse plant species, trees, and wildlife habitats. These systems offer numerous benefits, including:

• Improved soil health through increased organic matter and reduced erosion
• Enhanced water retention through mulching and cover cropping
• Increased biodiversity through agroforestry practices

Case studies in the Ethiopian highlands demonstrate successful implementation of biodiverse terracing systems, resulting in:

• 30-50% reduction in soil erosion rates
• 20-30% increase in crop yields
• Improved ecosystem services, such as pollination and pest control

**Section 3: Economic Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**

Implementing biodiverse terracing systems can offer economic benefits compared to conventional farming practices. A cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to determine the viability of these systems.

Potential economic benefits include:

• Reduced erosion costs through decreased soil loss
• Increased crop yields leading to higher income for farmers
• Improved ecosystem services, such as pollination and pest control

However, specific data on economic impact assessments, long-term cost-benefit analyses, and detailed community engagement strategies are needed to support policy decisions.

**Section 4: Policy and Institutional Support for Biodiverse Terraces**

Current policies in Ethiopia focus on water security and biodiversity conservation. However, more needs to be done to encourage the adoption of biodiverse terracing systems.

Recommendations for policy changes or incentives include:

• Providing financial support for farmers to implement biodiverse terracing systems
• Offering training and capacity-building programs for farmers and extension agents
• Integrating biodiverse terracing into national agricultural development plans

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis of biodiverse terracing systems compared to conventional farming methods.
2. Develop a long-term monitoring program to assess the economic, social, and environmental impacts of biodiverse terracing systems.
3. Strengthen policy support for biodiverse terracing by integrating it into national agricultural development plans.

**Closing Outlook**

Implementing biodiverse terracing systems in Ethiopia's highlands can help address water scarcity issues while promoting sustainable land use practices. By enhancing soil moisture retention, improving ecosystem services, and increasing biodiversity, these systems offer a dual solution for water security and climate adaptation. Addressing the economic, social, and environmental impacts of biodiverse terracing requires continued research, policy support, and community engagement.

**Data Points Needed:**

• Average annual precipitation levels in the Ethiopian Highlands
• Current soil erosion rates without biodiverse terracing systems
• Cost per hectare of implementing biodiverse terraces versus conventional farming methods

**Key Data Sources:**

* UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports on biodiversity conservation practices
* World Bank Water Supply and Sanitation Sector data in Ethiopia
* Local government agricultural development plans and policies
