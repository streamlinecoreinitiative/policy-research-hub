# Executive Summary

**Renewing Water Security, Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $10 million to [VERIFY] $50 million per project in large-scale water infrastructure projects such as wells, dams, and desalination plants. Additionally, decision-makers should prioritize expanding renewable energy access through subsidies, incentives, and public-private partnerships (PPPs), focusing on off-grid solutions for remote areas where grid electrification is not feasible or cost-effective. By implementing these interventions, we can mitigate the risks associated with climate variability and limited infrastructure while fostering sustainable economic growth.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity due to climate variability and limited infrastructure. According to World Bank data (2024), only 32.4% of people have access to safely managed drinking water, a stark contrast to the world average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Meanwhile, electricity access remains at 53.3%, with the continent lagging behind even in Sub-Saharan Africa’s average [Source: World Bank Open Data].

The region is also one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases globally, contributing around 14% of global emissions despite its lower per capita contribution. This puts the region at higher risk from extreme weather events such as hurricanes, heatwaves, and wildfires [NOAA climate data]. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated efforts to ensure sustainable development.

### Analysis

Access to safe drinking water and reliable electricity are foundational for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, current levels of access fall far short of global standards. For instance, only 32.4% of people have access to safely managed drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa [Source: World Bank Open Data], a stark contrast to the world average of 73.7%. Electricity access is also unevenly distributed; while Sub-Saharan Africa has seen modest gains from 51.9% in 2016 to 53.3% in 2023 [Source: World Bank Open Data], it lags behind other regions like the Middle East and North Africa (78.1%) and South Asia (76.6%) where electricity access is more widespread.

Renewable energy sources such as solar power are seen as a promising solution for addressing these challenges. Despite significant growth, renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa remains below global averages at 19.7% compared to the world average of 25% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. This indicates potential untapped opportunities for diversifying and scaling up clean energy solutions.

Climate variability exacerbates these challenges by increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa experienced a severe drought in 2019-2021 that affected millions [NOAA climate data].

### Policy Recommendations

To address the pressing needs of Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend the following:

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**: Develop and implement large-scale water infrastructure projects such as wells, dams, and desalination plants to improve access to safe drinking water.
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Access**: Promote the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar power through subsidies, incentives, and public-private partnerships (PPPs).
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Implement climate-resilient agricultural practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties and improved irrigation systems.

### Implementation Considerations

- Costs associated with water infrastructure projects can range from $10 million to [VERIFY] over $50 million per project.
- Renewable energy investments typically involve substantial upfront costs but offer long-term savings through reduced fuel dependency and maintenance expenses.
- Potential barriers include limited funding, regulatory hurdles, and resistance from communities skeptical of new technologies or infrastructure.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity due to climate variability and limited infrastructure. By focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation, decision-makers can mitigate these risks while fostering sustainable economic growth. Investing in large-scale water infrastructure projects, expanding renewable energy access through subsidies and PPPs, and enhancing climate resilience are crucial steps towards building a more resilient future.
