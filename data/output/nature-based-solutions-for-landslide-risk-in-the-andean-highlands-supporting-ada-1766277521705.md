**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

This brief highlights the importance of nature-based solutions in addressing landslide risk in the Andean highlands, a region vulnerable to climate change impacts. The focus is on supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity and Landslide Risk in the Andean Highlands

The Andean highlands face significant challenges due to climate change, including erratic rainfall patterns, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and landslides. Water scarcity is a pressing issue, affecting agriculture, livestock, and human consumption. The region's NDCs emphasize adaptation targets for water security, clean energy, and climate resilience.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Andean highlands include boreholes, canals, and traditional methods. However, these systems suffer from significant water loss due to evaporation and seepage. The lack of efficient irrigation methods exacerbates water scarcity, affecting food security and economic stability.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate that agroforestry can enhance water retention and reduce erosion, making it an essential component of climate-resilient irrigation systems.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a viable solution for efficient energy generation in the Andean highlands. Small-scale hydroelectric systems can provide reliable power for irrigation pumps, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have successfully integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to address water scarcity and landslide risk. These initiatives demonstrate the potential for scaling up, making them attractive solutions for policymakers and communities.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support adoption at scale:

1.  **Develop policy frameworks** that incentivize integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Provide technical assistance and capacity building** for local communities and governments.
3.  **Establish monitoring and evaluation mechanisms** to track project impacts and adapt strategies as needed.

Future research directions include:

*   Economic impact analysis of agroforestry-micro-hydro projects
*   Community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated systems
*   Scaling up initiatives through partnerships with local organizations and governments

### Closing Outlook

Nature-based solutions offer a promising approach to addressing landslide risk in the Andean highlands. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs while contributing to broader sustainable development goals.
