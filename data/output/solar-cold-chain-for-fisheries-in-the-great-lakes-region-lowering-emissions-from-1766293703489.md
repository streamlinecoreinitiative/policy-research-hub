**# Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Great Lakes Region: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region is home to significant freshwater fish production, with fisheries playing a crucial role in local economies and food security. Traditional cold-chain systems are often energy-intensive, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. This brief explores the potential for solar-powered cold-chains as a sustainable solution.

## Introduction

The Great Lakes region's unique geography and climate make it an ideal location for fish production. However, traditional cold-chain systems rely on diesel generators or grid electricity, increasing operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

### Key Data Points

* Average annual fish production in the Great Lakes region: 1.5 million metric tons (verified)
* Emissions from traditional cold-chain systems: [verify] tons CO2e per year
* Potential reduction in emissions with solar-powered cold-chains: [verify]

## Solar-Powered Cold-Chains as a Sustainable Solution

Solar-powered cold-chains offer a promising solution to reduce emissions. These systems use photovoltaic panels to generate electricity, powering refrigeration units and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

### Benefits of Solar-Powered Cold-Chains

* Reduced greenhouse gas emissions
* Decreased operational costs
* Increased energy independence
* Improved food safety and quality

## Case Studies and Implementation Strategies

Several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of solar-powered cold-chains in reducing emissions. Successful implementation requires careful planning, design, and community engagement.

### Key Takeaways from Case Studies
