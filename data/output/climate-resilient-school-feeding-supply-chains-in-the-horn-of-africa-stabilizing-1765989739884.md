**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, facing recurrent droughts that severely impact food security and economic stability. Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains can play a crucial role in stabilizing food security during these crises. This brief explores the benefits of integrating agroforestry systems into school feeding programs to enhance water security and bolster resilience against climate shifts.

**Climate Challenges in the Mekong Region**

The Mekong Basin is facing significant challenges from climate change, including altered rainfall patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Rising temperatures are projected to reduce agricultural productivity by 10-20% by 2050, exacerbating poverty and food insecurity (IPCC, 2019). Climate variability has already led to water scarcity issues, affecting rural livelihoods and economic growth.

**Current Water Security Issues**

Agricultural productivity in the Mekong Basin is heavily reliant on irrigation systems, which are often inefficient and unsustainable. Current water use efficiency among agricultural practices in the region remains low, with an average of 30-40% water loss due to evaporation and runoff (World Bank, 2017). This not only affects crop yields but also depletes groundwater resources, further straining rural communities.

**Role of Agroforestry Systems**

Agroforestry systems integrate trees with crops and livestock to improve soil health, conserve water, and increase biodiversity. By retaining soil moisture and reducing runoff, agroforestry can enhance water security and reduce the risk of crop failure during droughts. Successful examples from existing agroforestry projects in the Mekong Basin have demonstrated improved resilience against climate change impacts.

**Case Studies and Economic Benefits**

Several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry systems in improving soil moisture retention, biodiversity, and economic outcomes for farmers:

*   A study in Laos showed that agroforestry increased crop yields by 20-30% compared to conventional farming practices (OECD, 2018).
*   In Cambodia, an agroforestry project improved water use efficiency by 25%, reducing the risk of drought-related crop failure.
*   An economic analysis of agroforestry projects in Vietnam found that farmers experienced a 15-20% increase in income due to diversified income sources and sustainable land management practices.

**Policy Recommendations and Implementation Strategies**

To facilitate the adoption of agroforestry systems as part of climate adaptation strategies, we recommend:

1.  **National policy frameworks**: Develop policies at national and regional levels that support the integration of agroforestry systems into school feeding programs.
2.  **Regional cooperation**: Encourage regional collaboration to share best practices, expertise, and resources for implementing agroforestry projects.
3.  **Capacity building**: Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers, extension workers, and policymakers to promote the adoption of agroforestry systems.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Develop a national policy framework supporting the integration of agroforestry systems into school feeding programs.
2.  Establish regional cooperation mechanisms for sharing best practices and resources.
3.  Provide capacity-building programs for farmers, extension workers, and policymakers to promote agroforestry adoption.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are crucial for stabilizing food security during droughts in the Horn of Africa. By integrating agroforestry systems into these programs, we can enhance water security and bolster resilience against climate shifts. We urge policymakers, practitioners, and stakeholders to prioritize the implementation of agroforestry systems as part of climate adaptation strategies.
