**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Caribbean SIDS: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issue of climate change impacts on water security and energy access, we recommend investing [VERIFY] annually in renewable energy projects to increase consumption to at least 25% within five years. This investment will not only reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also provide a return on investment within the first five years. Additionally, developing sustainable water infrastructure that can provide safe drinking water is crucial for improving public health outcomes and reducing poverty.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% access in Sub-Saharan Africa) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and reliable electricity (53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and heatwaves.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: In Sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 2.2 billion people lack safe water [Source: UN-Water/WHO], highlighting a critical need for sustainable infrastructure investments.
- **Clean Energy Access**: The renewable energy consumption rate is only 19.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data], with even lower rates in Sub-Saharan Africa at 53.3%, indicating significant room for improvement.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts are exacerbated by inadequate water and energy security; regions like the Horn of Africa experience more frequent droughts and heatwaves.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Renewable Energy Access**: Invest in solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects to increase renewable energy consumption to at least 25% within five years.
2. **Sustainable Water Infrastructure**: Develop and finance water harvesting systems that can provide safe drinking water to a significant portion of Sub-Saharan Africa's population by 2030.
3. **Climate Resilient Policies**: Implement early warning systems for droughts and heatwaves, ensuring communities have access to clean energy during these periods.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Analysis**: Initial investment costs for renewable energy projects are estimated at [VERIFY] annually with a return on investment within the first five years.
- **Barriers Addressed**: Political resistance, lack of funding, and technical expertise can be mitigated by forming public-private partnerships and leveraging existing infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in lower-income countries is not only crucial for immediate survival but also essential for long-term economic development. By implementing these recommendations, governments and NGOs can significantly improve the lives of millions while contributing to global sustainability goals.
