# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Mekong basin: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To strengthen environmental resilience in lower-income countries, we recommend prioritizing watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Mekong basin. This approach can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from critical sectors such as agriculture and energy production. By investing in community-led water management initiatives and renewable energy projects, governments can improve access to clean water and energy while mitigating climate change impacts.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity and energy poverty, exacerbating climate vulnerability. According to the World Bank, only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (2024) [1]. Climate change intensifies these challenges through more frequent droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. The region's reliance on fossil fuels for energy exacerbates greenhouse gas emissions, contributing further to climate instability.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa uses only 9.2% of the world's freshwater resources (2021) [2]. This scarcity is exacerbated by rapid population growth and inadequate infrastructure.
- **Clean Energy Access**: The region’s renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7%, far below global averages, despite abundant solar, wind, and hydro potential [3].
- **Climate Adaptation**: Vulnerable communities are increasingly exposed to climate shocks, leading to food insecurity, displacement, and health crises.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Supply Infrastructure**:
   - Increase funding for desalination plants and water treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water.
   - Implement community-led watershed management programs to enhance local water resource sustainability.
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Sources**:
   - Invest in solar power generation projects, especially in rural areas where grid connectivity is insufficient or non-existent.
   - Develop mini-grid systems using renewable energy sources for off-grid households and small businesses.
3. **Build Climate Resilience Programs**:
   - Create early warning systems to mitigate the impacts of climate-induced disasters.
   - Implement sustainable agriculture practices that are resilient to changing weather patterns.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Mobilize public-private partnerships to fund infrastructure development and renewable energy projects, leveraging international grants and loans.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local communities and government officials in water management and renewable energy technologies.
- **Policy Frameworks**: Develop national policies that prioritize climate-resilient development strategies.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address its water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges to ensure sustainable growth. By implementing the recommended interventions, governments can significantly improve living standards while contributing to global environmental sustainability goals.

**Call to Action**: Governments and international partners should allocate resources for comprehensive implementation of these recommendations, fostering long-term resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa.
