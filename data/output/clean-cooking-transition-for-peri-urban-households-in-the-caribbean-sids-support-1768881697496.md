# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Caribbean SIDS: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in Caribbean SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries, particularly in the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), this policy brief advocates for a clean cooking transition. Specifically, we recommend that governments and development partners invest in decentralized renewable energy solutions, such as solar mini-grids and biogas plants, to provide access to clean energy for peri-urban households. This intervention is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving indoor air quality, and promoting sustainable development aligned with global goals like SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy).

## Context & Challenge

The Caribbean SIDS face significant challenges in achieving environmental resilience due to limited access to clean energy, inadequate water security, and vulnerability to climate change. According to the World Bank (2023), only [VERIFY] % of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, compared to 91.6% worldwide. This disparity is exacerbated by high costs and limited infrastructure in rural areas. Furthermore, the region's reliance on fossil fuels contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change.

## Analysis

### Access to Clean Energy

* Only [VERIFY] % of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023).
* The global average for renewable energy consumption is 19.7%, while Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 5.8% of total final energy consumption derived from renewables (World Bank, 2020).

### Water Security

* Only [VERIFY] % of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024).
* The global average for safely managed drinking water is 73.7%, highlighting a significant disparity between the region and the rest of the world.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Decentralized Renewable Energy Solutions**: Allocate resources to implement solar mini-grids and biogas plants in peri-urban areas, providing access to clean energy for households.
2. **Promote Energy Efficiency**: Implement policies to encourage the adoption of energy-efficient appliances and practices among households and businesses.
3. **Develop Climate-Resilient Water Management Strategies**: Invest in early warning systems for droughts and floods, and implement irrigation projects that use renewable energy sources.

## Implementation Considerations

* Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to estimate the financial requirements for implementing these interventions.
* Identify key barriers such as lack of technical expertise, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory hurdles. Develop strategies to overcome these obstacles through capacity building programs and policy reforms.

## Conclusion

The Caribbean SIDS require immediate attention and targeted investments in clean energy provision, water security, and climate adaptation measures. By adopting the proposed recommendations, stakeholders can contribute significantly to improving living standards while fostering sustainable development pathways for future generations. We urge governments and development partners to prioritize the clean cooking transition as a critical step towards achieving environmental resilience in the region.
