**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Central America Dry Corridor: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring water security, accessing clean energy, and adapting to climate change. This policy brief highlights the critical need for targeted interventions that can be implemented quickly with limited resources, focusing on areas where immediate improvements could have the most profound impact.

Key Findings:

* 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024).
* Only 53.3% of households in Sub-Saharan Africa have access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023).
* [VERIFY] Renewable energy consumption accounts for only 19.7% of global energy consumption (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

Recommendations:

1. Implement micro-insurance programs for smallholder drought risk.
2. Invest in solar cold-chains for fisheries in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt.
3. Develop climate-resilient school feeding supply chains.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries lack basic water and electricity access, exacerbating challenges posed by climate change. Rising population growth, urbanization pressures, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events underscore the need for immediate action.

Background on the Issue:

* Climate change leads to more frequent and severe weather events (IPCC, 2021).
* Water scarcity affects over 2 billion people worldwide (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

Why It Matters Now:

* Immediate action is needed due to rising population growth and urbanization pressures.
* Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe.

## Analysis

Access to safe drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa remains extremely low (32.4%) (World Bank Open Data, 2024), highlighting the urgent need for innovative solutions like micro-insurance. Renewable energy consumption is limited, with [VERIFY] only 19.7% of global energy coming from renewable sources (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

Evidence-Based Examination:

* A study by the World Bank found that micro-insurance can reduce agricultural losses by up to 40% (World Bank, 2023).
* Research indicates that solar-powered cold-chains for fisheries can reduce spoilage by up to 50% (FAO, 2024).
* Climate-resilient school feeding programs improve child nutrition outcomes (UNICEF, 2024).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk**:
	* Develop micro-insurance programs that cover small farmers in drought-prone areas.
	* Evidence: A study by the World Bank found that micro-insurance can reduce agricultural losses by up to 40% (World Bank, 2023).
	* Implementation Considerations:
		+ Costs: Estimated at $1 per farmer annually for coverage.
		+ Potential Barriers: Limited awareness and financial constraints among farmers.

2. **Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**:
	* Implement solar-powered cold-storage units to extend fish shelf life during transportation.
	* Evidence: Studies show that solar-powered refrigeration can reduce spoilage by up to 50% (FAO, 2024).
	* Implementation Considerations:
		+ Costs: Approximately $10,000 per unit.
		+ Potential Barriers: High initial investment and limited availability of skilled labor.

3. **Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**:
	* Develop climate-resilient school feeding programs that use local produce and are protected from extreme weather events.
	* Evidence: Research indicates that such programs can improve child nutrition outcomes (UNICEF, 2024).
	* Implementation Considerations:
		+ Costs: Approximately $50 per student annually for supplies and training.
		+ Potential Barriers: Limited institutional capacity to manage complex supply chains.

## Implementation Considerations

Immediate Steps:

* Pilot these interventions in high-risk areas first to gather data and refine strategies.

Costs:

* Estimated at $1 million initially for micro-insurance pilot, $50,000 for solar cold-chain units, and $250,000 for school feeding supply chain development.

Potential Barriers:

* Limited financial resources, lack of institutional capacity, and resistance to change.

## Conclusion

Immediate action is required to address the critical water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation needs in lower-income countries. By implementing targeted interventions such as micro-insurance, solar cold-chains for fisheries, and climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, we can begin to build more resilient communities that are better equipped to cope with future challenges.

Call to Action:

* Encourage government officials, NGO leaders, and development practitioners to prioritize these initiatives in their programming.
* Provide the necessary support and funding to scale up successful projects and share best practices across regions.
