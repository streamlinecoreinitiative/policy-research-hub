# Enhancing Environmental Resilience through Agroforestry Value Chains in Caribbean SIDS: A Climate-Resilient Approach to Cash Crops

## Executive Summary

This brief focuses on enhancing environmental resilience in lower-income countries by addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation through agroforestry value chains for cash crops. The Mesoamerican Highlands region serves as a case study due to its severe water scarcity and poverty challenges.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS)

Water scarcity affects many Caribbean SIDS, impacting agriculture and food security. Climate change exacerbates this issue through increased evaporation rates and altered precipitation patterns. Agroforestry practices can improve water retention and reduce erosion.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges in the Mesoamerican Highlands

Existing irrigation systems suffer from inefficiencies due to lack of reliable energy sources. Agroforestry has been demonstrated to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration in various case studies [verify].

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Micro-hydro technology can provide a reliable energy source for irrigation systems while reducing reliance on diesel generators. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro, communities can create climate-resilient water supply chains that support cash crop production.

### Key Benefits:

• Reduced water loss through improved retention and efficiency
• Increased access to clean energy for irrigation and other needs
• Enhanced soil health and biodiversity through agroforestry practices

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policymakers should prioritize the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in Caribbean SIDS. This includes:

* Providing incentives for farmers to adopt agroforestry practices
* Investing in micro-hydro infrastructure development
* Conducting further research on economic impact, community engagement, and scaling up

### Needed Evidence:

1.  **Climate Data:**
    - NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Caribbean SIDS (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade)
2.  **World Bank Reports:**
    - "Renewable Energy Consumption" focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)
3.  **Additional Research:**
    - Studies on economic impact, community engagement, and scaling up integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems

## Actions and Recommendations

1.  **Policy Support:** Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt agroforestry practices.
2.  **Infrastructure Development:** Invest in micro-hydro infrastructure development to increase energy efficiency.
3.  **Research and Development:** Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and scaling up.

## Closing Outlook

By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, Caribbean SIDS can enhance their environmental resilience, reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups, and promote sustainable cash crop production.
