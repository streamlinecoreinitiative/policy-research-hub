# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and ecologically sensitive regions globally, facing significant challenges from climate change. Rising sea levels, increased flooding, and landslides threaten the livelihoods of millions of people living in this region. This brief highlights the importance of integrating nature-based solutions to mitigate landslide risk and support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We focus on agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation, which can enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from vast wetlands are having a devastating impact on agriculture, food security, and economic stability. Smallholder farmers in vulnerable communities are particularly affected by traditional irrigation methods that are energy-intensive and costly.

## Current Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the region include boreholes and canals, which often suffer from water loss through evaporation and seepage. These inefficiencies exacerbate water scarcity and undermine efforts to achieve food security and economic stability.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate that agroforestry systems can enhance water retention and reduce erosion, making them an attractive solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a viable alternative to traditional energy sources, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency. These small-scale hydroelectric systems can be integrated with agroforestry practices to provide a sustainable solution for irrigation.

## Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems. Economic analysis has shown that these integrated solutions are cost-effective and can be scaled up to support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of nature-based solutions for landslide risk, we recommend:

1.  **Integrate climate-resilient irrigation practices** into national policies and programs.
2.  **Invest in agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems**, providing financial and technical support to smallholder farmers.
3.  **Develop and implement early warning systems** for landslides and flooding, ensuring timely evacuation of communities at risk.

## Closing Outlook

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical region that requires urgent attention to mitigate the impacts of climate change. By integrating nature-based solutions, we can enhance water security, promote renewable energy use, and support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. We must work together to ensure the long-term sustainability of this region and protect the livelihoods of millions of people living there.
