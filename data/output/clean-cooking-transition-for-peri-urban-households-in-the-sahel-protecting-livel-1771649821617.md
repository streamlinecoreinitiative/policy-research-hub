# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Sahel: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sahel: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief underscores the urgent need to enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in peri-urban areas of the Sahel region. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1] and over 50% lacking electricity (53.3%, World Bank, 2023), the region faces significant barriers in accessing basic services. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing unpredictability in rainfall patterns, leading to more frequent and severe droughts and floods. To address this crisis, we recommend:

* Expanding renewable energy adoption through public-private partnerships for financing solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation projects.
* Implementing efficient water management practices such as rainwater harvesting and solar-powered water purification systems.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is plagued by frequent droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, exacerbated by climate change. The region's limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%, World Bank, 2024) hinders economic growth and public health outcomes. Electricity access lags at [VERIFY] 53.3% (World Bank, 2023), with rural areas disproportionately affected. These issues are compounded by the region's heavy reliance on fossil fuels for energy production, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.

## Analysis

Data from the World Bank indicates that Sub-Saharan Africa’s renewable energy consumption is just [VERIFY] 19.7% of total final energy consumption (World Bank, 2020). This figure underscores a critical gap in meeting clean energy targets set by international development goals such as SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy. The region's water security challenges are equally pronounced, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safe drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank, 2024). Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing unpredictability in rainfall patterns, leading to more frequent and severe droughts and floods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Renewable Energy Adoption**: Prioritize investments in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. Encourage public-private partnerships for financing renewable energy infrastructure.
	* Data: World Bank (2024) shows 19.7% of total final energy consumption from renewables.
2. **Implement Efficient Water Management Practices**: Promote rainwater harvesting, solar-powered water purification systems, and efficient irrigation technologies to increase access to safe drinking water.
	* Data: Sub-Saharan Africa’s water security gap is 32.4%.
3. **Enhance Early Warning Systems**: Deploy advanced weather forecasting tools and early warning alerts for climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods. Strengthen community engagement in these systems to ensure timely responses.
	* Data: Climate change impacts, frequency of extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Estimates**: Scaling up renewable energy projects requires significant upfront investments; however, long-term savings on fuel costs can offset initial costs.
- **Barriers**: Political and institutional resistance may hinder policy implementation. Engaging stakeholders early in planning processes is crucial to address these challenges proactively.
- **Sustainability**: Ensure that all interventions are sustainable over the long term by incorporating cost-effective maintenance plans.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's environmental resilience hinges on addressing its water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation needs. Immediate action through policy recommendations will not only improve living conditions but also contribute to broader development goals. By fostering collaboration among various stakeholders, Sub-Saharan Africa can achieve sustainable progress in these critical areas.
