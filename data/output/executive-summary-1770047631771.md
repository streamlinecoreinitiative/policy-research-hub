**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Multi-faceted Approach**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces critical challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), this issue directly impacts health and economic stability. To address these issues, we recommend strengthening water infrastructure, promoting renewable energy adoption, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

### Key Findings

* Sub-Saharan Africa lacks [VERIFY] people with access to safely managed drinking water (32.4% of population), falling short of global coverage by 76.8 percentage points (World Bank Open Data).
* Only 53.3% of the region’s population has access to electricity, significantly below the world average and leaving millions vulnerable to energy shortages and economic losses (World Bank Open Data).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. The region suffers from limited safe water supply and low electricity access rates, exacerbated by climate change impacts like droughts and floods. Ensuring these resources is essential for economic development, health outcomes, and resilience against future shocks.

### Background on the Issue

* Sub-Saharan Africa lacks [VERIFY] people with access to safely managed drinking water (32.4% of population), falling short of global coverage by 76.8 percentage points (World Bank Open Data).
* Only 53.3% of the region’s population has access to electricity, significantly below the world average and leaving millions vulnerable to energy shortages and economic losses (World Bank Open Data).

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa lacks [VERIFY] people with access to safely managed drinking water (32.4% of population), falling short of global coverage by 76.8 percentage points (World Bank Open Data). This issue directly impacts health and economic stability.

### Clean Energy Access

Only 53.3% of the region’s population has access to electricity, significantly below the world average and leaving millions vulnerable to energy shortages and economic losses (World Bank Open Data).

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change is intensifying in Sub-Saharan Africa, with more frequent droughts and floods affecting water resources and infrastructure.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Water Infrastructure**:
	* Invest in rainwater harvesting systems, boreholes, and pipelines to increase access to safe drinking water.

## Implementation Considerations

### Cost

Initial investments in water infrastructure can range from $20,000-$100,000 per borehole; renewable energy projects may cost up to [VERIFY] for a solar power system.

### Barriers

Limited financial resources, inadequate technical expertise, and political resistance to change are potential hurdles.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is imperative. By implementing targeted policies and addressing implementation challenges, we can ensure sustainable development and improved quality of life for millions of people in the region.
