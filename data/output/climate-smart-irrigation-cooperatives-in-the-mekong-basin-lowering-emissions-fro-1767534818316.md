# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

### Executive Summary

The Mekong Basin faces severe water scarcity and climate change impacts, affecting food security for millions of people. Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can address these challenges while reducing emissions.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mekong Basin

*   The region is home to over 60 million people.
*   Approximately 70% of its population relies on agriculture for their livelihoods.
*   Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, droughts, and floods, exacerbating water scarcity issues.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

The majority of irrigation systems in the Mekong Basin rely on diesel-powered pumps or gravity-fed canals, resulting in significant energy consumption and water losses through evaporation and seepage. These practices strain local resources and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion and increasing water retention. Integrating agroforestry into irrigation systems can reduce farmers' reliance on external inputs and adapt to changing climate conditions.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a viable alternative to diesel-powered pumps by harnessing the energy potential of small rivers and streams. This approach reduces energy consumption and increases water efficiency through precise irrigation control.

### Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. These integrated approaches can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve water security, and enhance food production while promoting sustainable livelihoods.

### Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of these climate-smart irrigation cooperatives at scale:

1.  **Subsidies:** Offer financial incentives to farmers who adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Low-Interest Loans:** Provide affordable credit options for farmers to invest in integrated irrigation systems.
3.  **Infrastructure Development:** Invest in the development of micro-hydro infrastructure, including small dams and turbines.

### Future Research Directions

To further validate the effectiveness of these integrated approaches:

1.  **Long-term Sustainability Assessments:** Conduct thorough assessments of long-term sustainability and economic viability.
2.  **Community Engagement Strategies:** Develop effective community engagement strategies to promote adoption and ensure equitable benefits.

### Actions/Recommendations

*   Implement policy recommendations to support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.
*   Conduct further research on the effectiveness and scalability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
*   Engage with local stakeholders, including farmers, communities, and government agencies, to promote adoption and ensure equitable benefits.

### Closing Outlook

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives that integrate agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address water scarcity, reduce emissions, and enhance food security in the Mekong Basin. By implementing these integrated approaches at scale, we can create more resilient agricultural systems while promoting sustainable livelihoods for millions of people in the region.
