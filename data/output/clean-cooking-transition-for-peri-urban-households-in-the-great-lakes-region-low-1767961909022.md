# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Great Lakes Region: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region faces significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity and climate change impacts. This brief proposes an integrated approach leveraging agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to ensure sustainable economic benefits for peri-urban households in the Mesoamerican Highlands. The proposed solution aims to reduce emissions from critical sectors, improve water security, and enhance resilience to climate change.

## Addressing Severe Water Scarcity and Poverty

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mesoamerican Highlands

The Mesoamerican region is characterized by severe water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change impacts, population growth, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Current irrigation systems are inefficient, leading to high operational costs and limited access to electricity for micro-hydro systems.

### Current Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems rely heavily on traditional methods, which are often labor-intensive and inefficient. Socio-economic factors contribute significantly to water scarcity in the region, including:

* Limited access to clean energy sources
* Inadequate infrastructure for water management
* Insufficient funding for sustainable agriculture practices

### Agroforestry’s Role

Agroforestry practices have been shown to enhance soil fertility, improve water retention, and increase crop yields. Successful integration of agroforestry with traditional irrigation methods has been demonstrated:

* **Case Study 1:** A small-scale agroforestry project in Guatemala increased maize yields by [verify]%, while reducing water consumption by [verify]%. (Source: [insert source])
* **Case Study 2:** An integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro system in Honduras improved water security for local communities, reducing the risk of drought-related crop failures.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a reliable and low-cost solution for generating clean energy. Successful implementation of micro-hydro projects has been demonstrated:

* **Case Study 3:** A micro-hydro system in El Salvador provided electricity to over [verify] households, reducing carbon emissions by [verify]%. (Source: [insert source])
* **Case Study 4:** An agroforestry-based micro-hydro project in Nicaragua increased crop yields while generating revenue for local communities through the sale of excess energy.

## Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated approaches can significantly contribute to climate resilience:

* Drought-resistant crops and improved water management practices reduce vulnerability to climate-related shocks
* Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems provide a reliable source of clean energy, reducing dependence on fossil fuels
* Climate-resilient irrigation systems improve water security, supporting food production and economic stability

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, governments can:

1. **Establish policies** promoting integrated approaches to sustainable agriculture and energy generation.
2. **Provide funding** for research and development of climate-resilient irrigation systems.
3. **Support capacity building** for local communities to design and implement their own agroforestry-based micro-hydro projects.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the Mesoamerican region's renewable energy potential.
2. Develop and disseminate guidelines for implementing agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
3. Establish partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to support large-scale implementation of these solutions.

## Closing Outlook

The clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Great Lakes region is a critical step towards reducing emissions from critical sectors. By leveraging agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can ensure sustainable economic benefits while improving water security and climate resilience. This integrated approach has the potential to transform the Mesoamerican Highlands into a model of environmental stewardship and community-led development.
