# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Mekong Basin: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Mekong Basin is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and increased frequency of extreme weather events. The school feeding sector, which provides essential nutrition for millions of children, is particularly susceptible to these impacts. This brief outlines a comprehensive approach to enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries by integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Critical Need

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity, erratic rainfall patterns, and increased evaporation from wetlands, affecting agriculture and food security in the Mekong Basin. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, further straining economic resources in vulnerable communities. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a sustainable solution to enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

### Key Benefits of Integrated Systems

*   Improved soil health through vegetation cover
*   Enhanced biodiversity for natural pest control and pollination services
*   Increased water retention capacity and reduced erosion
*   Renewable energy generation from micro-hydro systems, reducing reliance on diesel generators
*   Cost savings on fuel and maintenance costs [verify]

## Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs: A Policy Framework

To support the adaptation targets outlined in NDCs, this initiative recommends:

1.  **Subsidies and Grants:** Governments can provide subsidies or grants to support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Infrastructure Development:** Funding for infrastructure improvements is necessary to facilitate the implementation of these solutions, such as developing community-based irrigation systems with local government support.
3.  **Sustainable Practices:** Policies promoting sustainable agricultural practices and renewable energy use can be implemented to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a thorough needs assessment to identify areas where integrated agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can be most effectively implemented.
2.  Develop a comprehensive policy framework that supports the adoption of these integrated systems, including subsidies and grants for smallholder farmers.
3.  Establish partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and community groups to ensure effective implementation and monitoring.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Mekong Basin require a multifaceted approach that integrates agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. By promoting climate-resilient irrigation and renewable energy use, this initiative supports adaptation targets outlined in NDCs while improving food security and livelihoods for local communities.
