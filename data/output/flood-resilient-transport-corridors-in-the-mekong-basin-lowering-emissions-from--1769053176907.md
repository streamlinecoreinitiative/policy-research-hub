**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the need to enhance water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa. To address this challenge, we recommend investing in flood-resilient transport corridors in the Mekong basin as a critical sector for lowering emissions. This initiative can improve water security by reducing flood risks, promote clean energy adoption through increased access to renewable energy sources, and enhance climate resilience by mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing severe water scarcity, limited access to electricity, and the impacts of climate change [NEEDS SOURCE]. The region's renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020], far below global averages. These statistics underscore the urgent need for policy interventions focused on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa's water security is compromised due to inadequate access to safe drinking water. Only 32.4% of people have access to safely managed water sources [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. This disparity contributes to poor health outcomes and economic instability.

### Clean Energy

The region lags behind in renewable energy consumption, with only 19.7% of total final energy consumed from renewables [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020]. This low level of clean energy adoption is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors**: Allocate funds for the development of flood-resilient transport corridors in the Mekong basin, leveraging international development partners like the World Bank.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**: Encourage investment in renewable energy sources through subsidies and tax incentives. Policies should incentivize the adoption of solar panels, wind turbines, and other clean technologies to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
3. **Climate Adaptation Programs**: Implement climate adaptation programs that include early warning systems for droughts and floods, as well as disaster risk reduction initiatives.

## Implementation Considerations

* Initial investments in flood-resilient transport corridors may range from $10 million to [VERIFY] per project, depending on scale and complexity.
* Potential barriers include limited government funding, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and resistance from communities skeptical of new technologies. Addressing these challenges requires strong political will, effective governance structures, and community engagement.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to ensure sustainable development. By implementing the recommended policy interventions, governments can significantly improve living standards while mitigating environmental risks. Collaboration between national policymakers, international organizations, and local communities is essential for realizing these goals.
