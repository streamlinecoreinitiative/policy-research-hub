# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Mekong Basin: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**
The Mekong Basin is a critical region for agricultural production, facing significant water security challenges due to climate change. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

**I. Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mekong Basin**

The Mekong Basin is a vital region for agriculture, supporting millions of people through its rich water resources. Climate change has led to increased variability in rainfall patterns, resulting in severe water scarcity and affecting agricultural productivity.

**II. Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Mekong Basin often rely on boreholes or canals, which are prone to inefficiencies that waste precious water resources and increase energy consumption.

**III. Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making them an essential component of climate-resilient agriculture. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can enhance water retention and reduce erosion.

**IV. Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution to traditional irrigation methods by harnessing the energy potential of small-scale hydroelectric systems, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Support policy reforms:** Encourage governments in the Mekong Basin to adopt policies that promote integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Invest in pilot projects:** Implement and evaluate pilot projects demonstrating the effectiveness of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.
3.  **Develop capacity-building programs:** Provide training and technical assistance to farmers, extension services, and local governments on sustainable water management practices.

**Closing Outlook**
Climate change poses significant challenges to agricultural production in lower-income countries. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance both water security and renewable energy use, ultimately supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). It is essential that governments, international organizations, and local stakeholders collaborate to promote the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong Basin.
