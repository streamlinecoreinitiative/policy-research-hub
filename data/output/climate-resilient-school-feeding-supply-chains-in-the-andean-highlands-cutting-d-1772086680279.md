**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Andean Highlands: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary
To enhance climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation measures. By improving access to safe drinking water (currently 32.4% of the population lacks this basic service) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and increasing electricity access (only 53.3% have reliable power supply), we can reduce vulnerability to climate-related disasters. Implementing these interventions will require a concerted effort from governments, international organizations, and local communities.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental challenges, including droughts, floods, and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change. The continent's population is disproportionately affected, with 32.4% lacking access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data] and only 53.3% having electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Ensuring sustainable and equitable access to safe drinking water, reliable energy supplies, and robust climate adaptation measures is crucial for socio-economic development.

## Analysis
### Access to Drinking Water
Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage of population with access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) compared to 73.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data]. This stark disparity highlights a critical need for investment in infrastructure, including boreholes and piped systems.

### Electricity Access
Only half of the Sub-Saharan African population has access to electricity, significantly below global levels (91.6%) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Rural areas are disproportionately affected with only 42.8% having reliable power supply. This disparity contributes to economic stagnation and limits opportunities for growth.

### Renewable Energy Consumption
Despite progress, renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data] and just 5.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Expanding solar, wind, and hydro projects can not only reduce carbon emissions but also provide a sustainable source of energy for millions.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in borehole drilling programs and community water supply systems. Implement cost-sharing mechanisms to ensure affordability.
2. **Expand Rural Electrification Programs**: Develop rural electrification plans that leverage government subsidies, private sector partnerships, and microfinance initiatives. Prioritize off-grid solar solutions for remote areas.
3. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Establish feed-in tariffs and tax incentives to encourage renewable energy investments. Collaborate with international partners like the World Bank to secure funding for large-scale projects.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Costs**: Initial investment in infrastructure can range from $10-$50 per capita, depending on technology and scale of implementation [VERIFY]
- **Barriers**: High upfront costs, lack of skilled workforce, regulatory hurdles. Address these by creating dedicated funds, training programs, and streamlined approval processes.

## Conclusion
By focusing on enhancing water security, promoting clean energy access, and strengthening climate adaptation measures, Sub-Saharan Africa can build a more resilient future for its people. Immediate action is required to bridge the existing gaps and accelerate progress towards sustainable development goals.
