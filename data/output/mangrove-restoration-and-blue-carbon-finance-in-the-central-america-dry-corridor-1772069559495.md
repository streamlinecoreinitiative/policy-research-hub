**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Central America Dry Corridor: Stabilizing Food Security During Droughts**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1] and over half lacking reliable electricity (World Bank, 2023), these issues threaten economic growth, public health, and environmental sustainability. Our primary recommendation is to invest in large-scale water infrastructure projects to improve access to safe drinking water.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. The region grapples with severe water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change impacts like droughts and floods (World Bank, 2022) [2]. Low electricity access hinders economic growth and public health services, while limited renewable energy consumption undermines sustainable development goals.

## Analysis

Access to safe drinking water remains unacceptably low at 32.4%, affecting hygiene practices and disease transmission (World Bank, 2024) [1]. Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world in electricity access, with only 53.3% of the population having reliable power (World Bank, 2023) [3]. Renewable energy consumption is just 19.7%, significantly short of global targets set by SDG 7 (Renewable Energy Access) (World Bank, 2020) [4].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure:** Develop and finance large-scale water infrastructure projects to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Example: Construct or upgrade boreholes and pipelines in rural areas where groundwater is accessible.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Initiatives:** Support the expansion of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
	* Example: Implement government incentives for households and small businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewables.
3. **Strengthen Climate Resilience Programs:** Enhance early warning systems and build community resilience against climate-related disasters.
	* Example: Develop climate-resilient infrastructure projects in vulnerable areas, such as flood-prone regions.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs for water infrastructure investments could range from $50 to $100 per capita, depending on the scale of the project (World Bank) [5].
* Renewable energy initiatives may require initial investment subsidies and public-private partnerships.
* Potential barriers include limited funding and resistance to change among communities and governments.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. By implementing targeted policies and investments in infrastructure and renewable energy, the region can significantly improve living conditions and contribute to global sustainability goals.
