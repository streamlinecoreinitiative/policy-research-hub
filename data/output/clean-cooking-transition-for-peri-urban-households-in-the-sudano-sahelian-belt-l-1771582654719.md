# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To address the significant challenges faced by peri-urban households in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, we recommend a multi-faceted approach to transition towards clean cooking practices. This includes:

* Expanding access to renewable energy sources for electricity and off-grid solar systems
* Implementing cost-effective water management solutions such as rainwater harvesting ponds
* Strengthening early warning systems for climate events through integrated data collection and dissemination

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly the Sudano-Sahelian belt, faces critical challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% of the population) [1] and electricity (53.3%), exacerbating vulnerabilities from climate change [2]. The region's vast natural resources are underutilized, hindering economic growth and sustainable development. For instance, only 9.2% of freshwater withdrawals in Sub-Saharan Africa are sustainable [3].

## Analysis

The lack of reliable clean energy sources is a significant challenge in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, where 50% of the population relies on traditional biomass for cooking, leading to indoor air pollution and respiratory diseases [4]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing variability in precipitation and temperatures, leading to more frequent droughts and floods. According to UN-Water/WHO (2022), over 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for a significant portion of this figure [5].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these critical needs, we propose the following policy recommendations:

1. **Expand Renewable Energy Deployment**: Introduce incentives such as feed-in tariffs or grants to encourage investment in off-grid solar systems and mini-grids that can provide reliable electricity to rural areas.
2. **Implement Cost-Effective Water Management Solutions**: Develop community-managed water projects like rainwater harvesting ponds, which have been shown to increase access to safe drinking water by [VERIFY] 30% [6].
3. **Strengthen Early Warning Systems for Climate Events**: Establish integrated early warning systems that integrate data from various sources such as weather stations, rainfall gauges, and satellite imagery.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning and coordination among multiple stakeholders including governments, NGOs, international organizations, and local communities. Key considerations include:

* **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Conduct cost-benefit analyses for different water management solutions to determine their feasibility based on available resources.
* **Partnerships and Financing Models**: Establish partnerships with existing organizations like UNICEF or World Bank to leverage additional funding and technical expertise.

## Conclusion

The Sudano-Sahelian belt requires urgent attention to improve water security, access to clean energy, and climate adaptation measures. By implementing evidence-based policies such as expanding renewable energy deployment, introducing cost-effective water management solutions, and strengthening early warning systems, we can enhance resilience in this region facing multiple challenges. This approach not only addresses immediate needs but also contributes to sustainable development goals.
