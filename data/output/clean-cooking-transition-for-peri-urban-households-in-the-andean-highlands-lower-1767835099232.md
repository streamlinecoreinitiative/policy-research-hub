# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Andean highlands are home to millions of peri-urban households that rely heavily on traditional cooking methods, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. This brief outlines a comprehensive approach to transition these households to cleaner cooking practices, focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

## Current Challenges and Opportunities

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Andean Highlands

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Andean highlands, impacting agriculture and household water security. The region receives an average annual rainfall of 800-1200 mm [verify], with precipitation variability ranging from 600-1400 mm (NOAA climate dataset). This unpredictability necessitates innovative solutions to ensure water availability for households.

### Current Cooking Practices

Traditional cooking methods in peri-urban Andean households are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy, while canal systems experience losses due to evaporation and seepage [verify]. Improved cookstoves can reduce emissions by up to 70%, but their adoption is hindered by high upfront costs.

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. In the Andean highlands, agroforestry can increase soil organic matter and biodiversity [verify]. However, specific benefits such as increased carbon sequestration by 3-7 tons/ha/year require further evidence.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, generating power ranges from 10-50 kW per system with an efficiency of 70-80% [verify]. By integrating micro-hydro systems with improved cookstoves, households can reduce emissions while promoting sustainable development.

## Integrated Solutions for Climate-Resilient Water Supply

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Clean Cooking Transition

The proposed solution integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with improved cookstoves to provide a cost-effective outcome. The total project cost per hectare is estimated at $10,000-$25,000 [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To create a supportive environment for the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, policy measures can provide incentives such as subsidies for farmers, grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency, and infrastructure development including roads, storage facilities, and other improvements.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a comprehensive assessment of water scarcity in the Andean highlands.
2.  Develop and disseminate improved cookstoves that are affordable and efficient.
3.  Promote agroforestry practices among peri-urban households to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
4.  Integrate micro-hydro systems with improved cookstoves to provide a cost-effective outcome.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to cleaner cooking practices in peri-urban Andean households is crucial for reducing emissions from critical sectors while promoting sustainable development. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with improved cookstoves, we can create a climate-resilient water supply that benefits both the environment and local communities.

### Needed Evidence

1.  **Climate Data:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Andean highlands (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2.  **Economic Analysis:**
    *   Economic Analysis of Traditional Irrigation Costs.
    *   Economic Analysis of Micro-Hydro Systems.
3.  **Socioeconomic Studies:**
    *   Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

### Rationale Summary

The proposed solution integrates agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to address severe water scarcity in the Andean highlands. The key data points will help validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these solutions, while needed evidence ensures that the proposed interventions are informed by existing research and best practices from similar regions.
