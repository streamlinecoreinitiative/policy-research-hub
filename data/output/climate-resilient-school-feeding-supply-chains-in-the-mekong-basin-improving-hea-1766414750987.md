# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Mekong basin: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Mekong Basin: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

### Executive Summary

The Mekong Basin is highly vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns threatening food security, water availability, and human health. The school feeding program in this region is particularly susceptible to these impacts due to its reliance on fragile supply chains that are often disrupted by extreme weather events.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change is altering precipitation patterns in the Mekong Basin, leading to more frequent droughts and floods. This variability affects agricultural production, water availability, and human health, particularly for vulnerable populations such as schoolchildren. The school feeding program relies on locally sourced food, making it essential to address these challenges through climate-resilient supply chains.

### Current Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation methods in the Mekong Basin are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers. Existing irrigation systems often rely on diesel generators or fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Water loss through evaporation and seepage is significant, further reducing water availability.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices can enhance both soil health and biodiversity, improving water retention and reducing erosion. Case studies demonstrate the benefits of agroforestry systems for climate resilience:

* Improved water retention: [verify] (Case Study 1)
* Reduced erosion: [verify] (Case Study 2)

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a renewable energy solution for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency. Economic analysis shows cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

### Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects demonstrate the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems:

* [Pilot Project 1]: Improved water retention and reduced erosion
* [Pilot Project 2]: Increased energy efficiency and cost savings

Economic analysis shows potential for cost-effectiveness and scalability.

### Policy Recommendations

To support adoption at scale, we recommend:

* Subsidies for agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems
* Low-interest loans for smallholder farmers to adopt climate-resilient irrigation methods
* Infrastructure development for integrated water management

Suggested areas for further research include long-term sustainability assessments and community engagement strategies.

### Future Research Directions

Additional studies are needed to:

* Validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems
* Assess long-term sustainability and scalability
* Develop effective community engagement and participation strategies

### Actions/Recommendations

1. **Develop a comprehensive climate-resilient school feeding program** that integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies.
2. **Provide technical assistance and capacity building** for smallholder farmers to adopt climate-resilient irrigation methods.
3. **Establish partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and private sector entities** to support the adoption of integrated water management practices.

### Closing Outlook

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, water availability, and human health in the Mekong Basin. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with clean energy and climate adaptation strategies, we can build more resilient school feeding supply chains. This brief provides a framework for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to work together towards a more sustainable future for the region's most vulnerable populations.
