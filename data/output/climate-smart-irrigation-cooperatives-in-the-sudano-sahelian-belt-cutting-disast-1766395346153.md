# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Enhancing Resilience and Efficiency**

### Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by severe water scarcity and poverty. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a climate-resilient irrigation solution for this region. By integrating agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric systems, farmers can reduce their reliance on diesel generators and improve energy efficiency. Pilot projects have demonstrated economic benefits and potential for scaling up this integrated approach.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

The Sudano-Sahelian belt has a semi-arid climate with limited rainfall, making it prone to droughts. Climate change has exacerbated these conditions, leading to severe water scarcity and poverty. Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for many communities in this region.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian belt include boreholes and canals. These systems suffer from high evaporation rates ([verify]%) and seepage losses ([verify]%), making them unsustainable for long-term use. The high cost of diesel generators used to power pumps further exacerbates the financial burden on farmers.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, agroforestry can also reduce erosion and increase water retention. Case studies from similar regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving crop yields.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology involves the use of small-scale hydroelectric systems to generate electricity. This approach has several benefits, including reduced reliance on diesel generators and increased energy efficiency. By harnessing the power of water, micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable source of energy for irrigation pumps.

### Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to create climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives. These cooperatives not only reduce water loss and increase energy efficiency but also provide economic benefits to farmers through reduced fuel costs and increased crop yields.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of this integrated approach at scale, we recommend:

*   **Policy Support:** Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
*   **Capacity Building:** Training programs should be established to educate farmers on the benefits and implementation of these systems.
*   **Scaling Up:** Pilot projects should be scaled up to involve more communities and demonstrate the economic viability of this approach.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  Establish a task force to oversee the implementation of climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.
2.  Provide training programs for farmers on agroforestry practices and micro-hydro system installation.
3.  Develop a policy framework to support the adoption of these systems at scale.

### Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to address water scarcity and poverty in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By supporting the adoption of this approach, governments can help vulnerable communities build resilience to climate change and improve their economic prospects.
