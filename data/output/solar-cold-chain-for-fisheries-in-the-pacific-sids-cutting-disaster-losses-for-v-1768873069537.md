**Enhancing Water Security, Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), posing serious health risks and economic challenges. Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7%, leaving vast populations without reliable power sources. This brief highlights the critical need for targeted interventions in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to support sustainable development.

- **Key Findings**: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in accessing safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%). Renewable energy consumption is only 19.7%, indicating a significant gap.
- **Recommendations**: Implement policies promoting clean cooking solutions, enhance renewable energy infrastructure, and develop climate-resilient agriculture practices.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's water scarcity and energy poverty are critical issues exacerbated by climate change. While access to safe drinking water is improving globally (73.7%), Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind at 32.4%. Similarly, electricity access stands at 53.3%, with renewable energy consumption only 19.7%.

  - Access to electricity: World (91.6), Sub-Saharan Africa (53.3) [Source: World Bank Open Data]
  - Renewable energy consumption: World (19.7) [Source: World Bank Open Data]

## Analysis

Water scarcity and energy poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa are interconnected with climate change, leading to health risks and economic stagnation. Improving water security through sustainable irrigation systems can reduce agricultural losses during droughts. Similarly, expanding renewable energy sources like solar and wind power can lower emissions while providing reliable electricity.

  - Water scarcity affects over two billion people globally [Source: UN-Water/WHO]
  - Sub-Saharan Africa's climate vulnerability is projected to worsen due to rising temperatures and altered rainfall patterns [Source: IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land]

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Promote Clean Cooking Solutions**: Invest in biogas digesters, solar cookers, and improved stoves to reduce indoor air pollution and improve health outcomes.
2. **Enhance Renewable Energy Infrastructure**: Accelerate the deployment of solar-powered mini-grids and wind turbines in rural areas to provide reliable electricity.
3. **Develop Climate-Resilient Agriculture Practices**: Introduce drought-resistant crop varieties and promote water-efficient irrigation systems like drip or micro-sprinklers.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Costs**: Estimated investment for clean cooking solutions is $10-$20 per household, renewable energy infrastructure costs vary but can be subsidized through grants.
2. **Barriers**: Limited funding, lack of technical expertise in rural areas, and resistance to change from traditional practices.
3. **Success Stories**: Successful initiatives include solar-powered mini-grids in Kenya reducing kerosene use by 60% [Source: International Energy Agency]

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to achieve sustainable development goals. By implementing targeted interventions and overcoming barriers, policymakers can enhance the resilience of communities against future shocks.

- **Call to Action**: Develop a comprehensive plan that integrates clean cooking solutions with renewable energy infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa. Encourage collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities to ensure effective implementation.
- **Next Steps**: Conduct baseline studies on current water security and energy access levels across the region to inform targeted interventions.
