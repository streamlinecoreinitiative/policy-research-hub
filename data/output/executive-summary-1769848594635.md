**Policy Brief on Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience: A Path Forward for Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issues of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in decentralized renewable energy solutions to increase access to electricity. Specifically, governments and development partners should implement solar-powered mini-grids in rural areas to provide electricity access and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. This approach can be replicated in other regions with similar challenges.

Key findings:

* 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank, 2024].
* Only 53.3% of the region's population has electricity access [Source: World Bank, 2023].
* Renewable energy consumption remains low at just 19.7% globally [Source: World Bank, 2020].

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 2.2 billion people lacking safe drinking water [Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022], with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank, 2024]. The lack of basic sanitation facilities leads to health issues and increased mortality rates among children under five years old. Inadequate electricity infrastructure hinders economic growth and limits education opportunities.

## Analysis

Evidence-based examination reveals significant gaps in water security and clean energy access:

* **Water Security**: While 73.7% of the world has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank, 2024], only 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa is a stark contrast.
* **Clean Energy Access**: Only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan African population has electricity access [Source: World Bank, 2023] compared to the world average at 91.6% [Source: World Bank, 2023].
* **Climate Adaptation**: Renewable energy consumption remains low at just 19.7% globally [Source: World Bank, 2020], with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging even further behind.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Decentralized Renewable Energy Solutions**:
	* Implement solar-powered mini-grids in rural areas to provide electricity access and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
	* Invest in off-grid renewable energy systems (solar, wind) for communities unable to connect to the national grid.
2. **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**:
	* Develop community-led water storage tanks to mitigate drought risks and ensure year-round water supply.
	* Construct microgrids that can operate independently during power outages caused by climate events.
3. **Community-Led Initiatives for Sustainable Water Management**:
	* Promote rainwater harvesting ponds in rural areas where surface water is scarce or contaminated, ensuring sustainable water resources.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing decentralized renewable energy solutions and microgrids can be costly but yields significant long-term benefits. Community-led initiatives are cost-effective and increase local ownership. Potential barriers include limited financial resources for initial investments in infrastructure, technological challenges in setting up off-grid systems, and resistance from traditional power providers who may prefer central grid solutions.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience requires immediate policy action. By focusing on decentralized renewable energy solutions, community-led initiatives, and climate-resilient infrastructure projects, we can make meaningful progress towards SDG 6 and other related targets in Sub-Saharan Africa. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and communities is crucial to realizing these goals.
