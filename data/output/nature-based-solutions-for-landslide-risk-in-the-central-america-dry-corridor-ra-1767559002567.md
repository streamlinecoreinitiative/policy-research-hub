**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Central America Dry Corridor: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

### Executive Summary

This brief highlights the importance of nature-based solutions to address landslide risk and improve water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries. The focus is on the Central America dry corridor, where climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities.

### Introduction

Climate change impacts agriculture worldwide, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events. In the Central America dry corridor, severe water scarcity affects agricultural productivity, posing significant challenges to food security and economic development.

**Water Scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor**

* Average annual rainfall: [verify] 800-1200 mm
* Precipitation variability range: [verify] 600-1400 mm

### Current Irrigation Practices and Their Limitations

Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive, costly, and often unsustainable. Key data points include:

* Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day
* Canal systems incur significant losses due to evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%)

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Key data points include:

* Soil organic matter increases by [verify]%
* Biodiversity increase: [verify] native species
* Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, with key data points including:

* Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system
* Energy efficiency: 70-80%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions, with key data points including:

* Total project cost per hectare: [verify] $10,000-$25,000
* Return on investment (ROI): 3-5 years
* Long-term sustainability assessments

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Key data points include:

* Subsidies for farmers: Incentives provided to encourage adoption
* Grid integration: Enhancing reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure development: Roads, storage facilities, and other improvements

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems** to address water scarcity and enhance climate resilience in the Central America dry corridor.
2.  **Develop policy measures** that provide incentives for farmers to adopt these integrated systems, including subsidies and grid integration.
3.  **Invest in infrastructure development**, such as roads and storage facilities, to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

### Closing Outlook

This brief highlights the potential of nature-based solutions to address landslide risk and improve water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries. The proposed solution integrates agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance climate resilience, providing a cost-effective approach for irrigation efficiency. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of these integrated systems and inform policy measures that support their adoption.
