# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, facing severe climate-related challenges that exacerbate food insecurity and economic instability. This brief presents an integrated approach to address water scarcity through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

The Sudano-Sahelian belt spans across several countries in West Africa, including Nigeria, Chad, and parts of Senegal. This region is characterized by erratic rainfall patterns, with some areas receiving as little as [verify] mm per year (NOAA Climate Dataset). The resulting water scarcity has severe implications for agriculture, a critical sector that employs a significant percentage of the workforce in these countries.

### Overview of Climate Change Impacts

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity through increased evaporation rates and altered rainfall patterns. According to the World Bank Report "Renewable Energy Consumption in West Africa" (latest report), renewable energy consumption accounts for a small percentage of total final energy consumption in the region, further highlighting the need for sustainable solutions.

### Importance of Resilient Irrigation Methods

Resilient irrigation methods are crucial for food security and economic stability. Traditional irrigation systems often suffer from high water loss rates due to evaporation (30% [verify]) and seepage (5% [verify]). This brief proposes an integrated approach that combines agroforestry with micro-hydro technology to reduce water losses, increase energy efficiency, and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian belt include boreholes and canals. However, these systems are often inefficient and prone to water loss:

* Boreholes rely on diesel generators for pumping, resulting in high operating costs and environmental pollution.
* Canals suffer from evaporation losses due to open channels.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, agroforestry systems can:

* Enhance water retention through increased root depth and vegetation cover
* Reduce erosion by stabilizing soil with tree roots
* Promote biodiversity through habitat creation for wildlife

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable alternative to diesel generators. By harnessing the energy of small streams or rivers, micro-hydro systems can:

* Provide reliable and renewable energy for irrigation pumps
* Reduce operating costs and environmental pollution
* Increase energy efficiency through optimized system design

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry with micro-hydro technology. For example:

* A study in Nigeria showed that integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems reduced water losses by [verify]% compared to traditional irrigation methods.
* Another project in Chad reported a [verify]% increase in crop yields due to improved soil health and increased water retention.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale, we recommend:

* Developing national policies that promote sustainable agriculture practices and renewable energy adoption
* Providing training and capacity-building programs for farmers and irrigation managers
* Conducting further research on economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability of these solutions

## Closing Outlook

The Sudano-Sahelian belt faces significant water scarcity challenges that require innovative and sustainable solutions. This brief presents an integrated approach that combines agroforestry with micro-hydro technology to reduce water losses, increase energy efficiency, and promote climate-resilient irrigation practices.
