**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries, with a focus on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. In the context of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, we recommend investing in mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives to support community-led projects that promote ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) and reduce vulnerability to climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and environmentally vulnerable regions globally. Rising temperatures, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events threaten the livelihoods of millions living in this region [1]. According to the World Bank, only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water, while 53.3% lack electricity, exacerbating health risks and economic disparities [2].

## Analysis

Recent data highlights the urgent need for climate-resilient infrastructure and ecosystem-based adaptation measures:

* **Water Access**: The global average for safely managed drinking water is 73.7%, with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind at 32.4% [3].
* **Energy Access**: Only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, far below the global average of 91.6% [4].
* **Renewable Energy**: Renewable energy consumption accounts for only 19.7% of global energy consumption, with significant potential for growth in Sub-Saharan Africa [5].

Climate data underscores the region's vulnerability:

* **Temperature Increase**: Temperatures have risen by about 0.5°C in recent years, impacting agriculture and water resources.
* **Extreme Weather Events**: Increased frequency of droughts and floods threatens infrastructure and food security.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following policy actions:

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Invest in desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and wastewater treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Support community-led initiatives for water management and conservation.
2. **Increase Renewable Energy Access**:
	* Promote solar, wind, and hydro projects to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate climate risks.
	* Develop training programs for local communities and officials on renewable energy integration.
3. **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**:
	* Develop early warning systems for extreme weather events and fortify buildings against natural disasters.
	* Support community-led initiatives for disaster risk reduction and management.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require:

* **Investment**: Significant financial support from international donors and domestic governments to fund projects.
* **Capacity Building**: Training local communities and officials on water management, renewable energy integration, and climate adaptation strategies.
* **Coordination**: Collaboration among government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities for effective implementation.

## Conclusion

Enhancing environmental resilience in lower-income countries is critical for sustainable development. By investing in mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives, we can support community-led projects that promote ecosystem-based adaptation and reduce vulnerability to climate-related disasters. We urge governments, international organizations, and stakeholders to prioritize these recommendations and work towards a more resilient future.
