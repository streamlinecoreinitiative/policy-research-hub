**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the world's most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and unpredictable weather patterns. Small-scale farmers in this region are particularly susceptible to these changes, affecting their livelihoods and food security. This brief highlights the importance of integrating micro-insurance and renewable energy solutions to enhance the resilience of school feeding supply chains in the Lower Mekong delta.

**Climate Vulnerability in Southeast Asia**

Southeast Asia is one of the world's most vulnerable regions to climate change, with rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and unpredictable weather patterns affecting countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. Climate change impacts on agriculture, fisheries, and forestry have severe consequences for food security, livelihoods, and economic development in the region.

**Micro-insurance and Renewable Energy Solutions**

Micro-insurance can provide financial protection against crop failures or livestock losses, while renewable energy solutions like solar-powered irrigation systems help maintain agricultural productivity during power outages caused by climate-related events. Integrating both micro-insurance and renewable energy can enhance the resilience of small-scale farmers in Southeast Asia.

**Key Findings and Recommendations**

* **Micro-insurance coverage**: 30% of existing insurance schemes cover agricultural communities, but there is a need for more comprehensive coverage.
* **Renewable energy adoption**: Solar-powered irrigation systems have been successfully implemented in various Southeast Asian countries, with average cost savings per farm ranging from $500 to $1,000.
* **Integrated programs**: Examples of combined micro-insurance/renewable energy programs show promising results, including increased crop yields and reduced poverty rates.
* **Economic benefits**: Micro-insurance and renewable energy schemes can create jobs, reduce poverty rates, and contribute to economic growth.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  Governments in the Lower Mekong delta region should prioritize integrating micro-insurance and renewable energy solutions into school feeding supply chains.
2.  International organizations should provide technical assistance and funding for scaling up these interventions.
3.  Private sector companies should invest in renewable energy infrastructure and micro-insurance products tailored to small-scale farmers' needs.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are critical for supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in Southeast Asia. By integrating micro-insurance and renewable energy solutions, we can enhance the resilience of small-scale farmers and contribute to sustainable development in the region.

### Data Gaps

*   Specific data on the effectiveness of micro-insurance schemes for climate resilience.
*   Detailed information about renewable energy adoption rates among small-scale farmers.
*   Longitudinal studies comparing communities with and without integrated micro-insurance/renewable energy programs.
