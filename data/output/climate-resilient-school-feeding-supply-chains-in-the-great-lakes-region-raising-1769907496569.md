**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Great Lakes Region: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, we recommend investing $1 billion over 5 years to expand access to safe drinking water, promote clean energy, and enhance climate resilience. This investment will focus on targeted infrastructure projects, community engagement, and public-private partnerships to improve water security for [VERIFY] million people, increase renewable energy consumption by [VERIFY]%, and establish early warning systems for climate events in 50 communities.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% globally, 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa) [World Bank Open Data]. Renewable energy consumption remains below global targets at 19.7% [World Bank Open Data]. These challenges disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, exacerbating poverty and climate change impacts.

## Analysis

The interconnection between water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is evident in the following examples:

* Limited electricity supply leads to inefficient irrigation systems, resulting in reduced crop yields and increased vulnerability to climate shocks like drought [FAO 2023].
* Inadequate renewable energy use contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, further intensifying climate change impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
	* Invest $200 million in infrastructure projects such as boreholes, water treatment facilities, and sanitation systems [World Bank 2024].
	* Mobilize local communities for sustainable management of new water sources through community engagement initiatives [UN-Water/WHO 2022].
	* Collaborate with private sector companies to improve access in remote areas through public-private partnerships [IDB 2023].
2. **Promote Clean Energy Access**:
	* Implement policies that subsidize renewable energy technologies like solar panels and wind turbines for low-income households [IRENA 2024].
	* Deploy microgrid systems in rural areas to provide reliable electricity at a lower cost [World Bank 2023].
	* Initiate energy efficiency programs targeting public institutions, schools, and clinics [UNDP 2023].
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Establish early warning systems for climate events such as floods and droughts to provide timely alerts and support [NOAA 2024].
	* Build infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather conditions, including flood-proof roads, resilient housing, and climate-resilient schools.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure the success of these interventions, we recommend:

* Securing dedicated funding streams from international development partners, national budgets, and private sector investments.
* Training local technicians and community leaders in the maintenance and operation of new infrastructure.
* Advocating for supportive policies such as tax incentives, subsidies, and regulatory frameworks that encourage renewable energy adoption.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for reducing poverty and enhancing resilience in lower-income countries. By investing $1 billion over 5 years to expand access to safe drinking water, promote clean energy, and enhance climate resilience, we can make meaningful progress towards a more sustainable future.
