# Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Mekong Basin is one of the most water-stressed regions globally, with severe droughts affecting smallholder farmers' livelihoods and food security. Climate change exacerbates these impacts, requiring integrated solutions that address water scarcity, poverty, and emissions reduction. This brief explores micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk as a critical component in promoting environmental resilience.

## Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts in the Mekong Basin

The Mekong Basin is home to over 60 million people, relying heavily on agriculture for livelihoods. However, severe droughts have become more frequent due to climate change, affecting crop yields and food security. Rising temperatures increase evaporation rates, while altered precipitation patterns reduce water availability. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable, with limited access to financial resources and insurance mechanisms.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. When combined with micro-hydro technology, these systems can enhance irrigation efficiency while reducing reliance on diesel generators. A case study in the Mesoamerican Highlands demonstrates that agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems:

*   Reduced water loss through efficient irrigation methods
*   Increased crop yields
*   Sequestered CO2 equivalent per hectare per year [verify]

## Micro-Insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk: A Critical Component in Environmental Resilience

Micro-insurance can provide smallholder farmers with financial protection against drought-related losses. By integrating micro-insurance with climate-resilient water supply systems, such as agroforestry-based micro-hydro, farmers can:

*   Recover from financial shocks caused by droughts
*   Invest in sustainable agriculture practices and climate-resilient infrastructure
*   Reduce greenhouse gas emissions through efficient irrigation methods

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Develop and pilot micro-insurance products** tailored to smallholder farmers' needs, focusing on drought risk management.
2.  **Scale up agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems**, promoting their adoption among smallholder farmers and supporting policy frameworks for climate-resilient water supply.
3.  **Strengthen partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities** to leverage resources and expertise in implementing integrated solutions.

## Closing Outlook

Addressing drought risk in the Mekong Basin requires a comprehensive approach that integrates micro-insurance with climate-resilient water supply systems. By promoting agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems and developing tailored micro-insurance products, we can support smallholder farmers' livelihoods while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
