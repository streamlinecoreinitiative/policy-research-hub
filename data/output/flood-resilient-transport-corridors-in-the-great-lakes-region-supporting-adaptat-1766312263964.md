# Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region is vulnerable to climate change impacts, including extreme weather events and changing precipitation patterns. Traditional transport infrastructure often lacks flood resilience, making it susceptible to damage from floods and other extreme events. This brief highlights the importance of integrating flood-resilient design principles into transport corridor planning and development.

## Introduction to Flood Risk in the Great Lakes Region

The region's unique geography, with numerous lakes, rivers, and wetlands, poses significant flood risks. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall and flooding.

### Key Challenges

- **Increasing Flood Frequency and Severity:** Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are expected to lead to more frequent and severe floods.
- **Transport Infrastructure Vulnerability:** Traditional transport infrastructure is often designed without consideration for flood resilience.
- **Economic Impacts:** Flooding can have significant economic impacts on the region's economy, including damage to property, disruption of supply chains, and loss of productivity.

## Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors: A Solution

Integrating flood-resilient design principles into transport corridor planning and development can help mitigate the risks associated with flooding. This includes:

### Key Strategies

- **Elevated Design:** Designing roads and bridges to elevated levels to protect against flooding.
- **Green Infrastructure:** Incorporating green infrastructure, such as wetlands and green roofs, to absorb excess rainfall and reduce stormwater runoff.
- **Flood-Resilient Materials:** Using flood-resilient materials in construction.

## Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

The Paris Agreement emphasizes the importance of supporting adaptation efforts. Integrating flood-resilient design principles into transport corridor planning and development can help support these efforts by:

### Key Benefits

- **Reducing Flood Risks:** By designing transport infrastructure with flood resilience in mind, we can reduce the risks associated with flooding.
- **Supporting Economic Growth:** By protecting against flood damage, we can support economic growth and development in the region.
- **Enhancing Climate Resilience:** By incorporating climate-resilient design principles into transport corridor planning and development, we can enhance the overall resilience of the transportation sector.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Integrate Flood-Resilient Design Principles:** Incorporate flood-resilient design principles into transport corridor planning and development.
2.  **Conduct Climate Risk Assessments:** Conduct climate risk assessments to identify areas most vulnerable to flooding.
3.  **Develop Green Infrastructure Plans:** Develop green infrastructure plans to incorporate wetlands, green roofs, and other green infrastructure elements.

## Closing Outlook

The Great Lakes region is facing significant flood risks due to climate change. Integrating flood-resilient design principles into transport corridor planning and development can help mitigate these risks and support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.
