**Executive Summary**

Environmental resilience is crucial for lower-income countries to mitigate the impacts of climate change, ensure access to basic services like water and energy, and protect communities from environmental shocks. This brief provides an overview of the current state of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in these countries. It highlights key challenges, data gaps, and policy recommendations to support effective decision-making.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Security Challenges**

Water security is a pressing concern for lower-income countries, where approximately [NEEDS VERIFICATION] people lack access to safe drinking water (UNICEF/Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Centre). Improved sanitation facilities are also scarce, with only [NEEDS VERIFICATION]% of the population using such facilities (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme). Understanding these challenges is essential for developing effective strategies.

**Section 2: Clean Energy Solutions for Lower-Income Countries**

Access to clean energy is vital for reducing carbon emissions and improving livelihoods. However, only [NEEDS VERIFICATION]% of the population in lower-income countries has access to electricity (World Bank), and installed renewable energy capacity per capita remains limited (International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA). Investing in clean energy can help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change impacts.

**Section 3: Climate Adaptation Strategies**

Effective climate adaptation strategies are essential for protecting communities and economies. While some progress has been made, [NEEDS VERIFICATION]% of GDP is allocated to climate change mitigation/adaptation (OECD Development Assistance Committee), and international donors fund limited climate-related projects (World Bank, OECD). Strengthening climate adaptation efforts can help build resilience and reduce vulnerability.

**Section 4: Infrastructure Investments for Resilience**

Investing in resilient infrastructure is critical for reducing vulnerability to environmental shocks. Total investment in climate-related projects remains [NEEDS VERIFICATION] (World Bank), and governments allocate only [NEEDS VERIFICATION]% of their budget to climate change adaptation and mitigation (OECD Development Assistance Committee). Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure can help reduce losses from natural disasters.

**Section 5: Community Engagement and Education**

Involving communities is essential for successful environmental resilience initiatives. While some progress has been made, [NEEDS VERIFICATION]% of community members are involved in decision-making processes related to climate change (UNDP Global Environment Facility), and educational programs on environmental sustainability remain limited (local ministries, UNICEF). Strengthening community engagement can help build support for environmental resilience efforts.

**Section 6: Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks**

Establishing robust monitoring systems is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of policies. Only [NEEDS VERIFICATION] countries have comprehensive climate change monitoring frameworks (UNEP Global Environment Outlook), and government spending on environmental governance remains limited (OECD Development Assistance Committee). Developing effective monitoring systems can help track progress and inform policy decisions.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Strengthen water security efforts**: Invest in water infrastructure, improve sanitation facilities, and enhance access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote clean energy solutions**: Increase investment in renewable energy, expand access to electricity, and develop climate-resilient energy systems.
3. **Enhance climate adaptation strategies**: Allocate more resources to climate change mitigation/adaptation efforts, strengthen climate resilience infrastructure, and engage communities in decision-making processes.
4. **Develop effective monitoring frameworks**: Establish comprehensive climate change monitoring systems, track progress on environmental governance, and inform policy decisions.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience is a critical concern for lower-income countries, where water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges persist. By understanding these challenges, investing in resilient infrastructure, engaging communities, and developing effective monitoring frameworks, governments can build stronger foundations for environmental resilience. This brief provides a starting point for policymakers to address these pressing issues and support the development of more sustainable and resilient communities.
