**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To enhance resilience against climate change, we recommend prioritizing flood-resilient transport corridors in the Lower Mekong delta region. This involves implementing cost-effective measures such as upgrading infrastructure to withstand flooding, promoting sustainable land use practices, and enhancing early warning systems for communities living along rivers and coastal areas.

* Key findings: The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, with [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population lacking access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024).
* Recommendations:
	+ Implement flood-resilient transport corridors by upgrading infrastructure to withstand flooding.
	+ Promote sustainable land use practices through reforestation and agroforestry initiatives.
	+ Enhance early warning systems for communities living along rivers and coastal areas.

## Context & Challenge

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions in Southeast Asia, with [VERIFY] 32.4% of its population lacking access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Climate change exacerbates this vulnerability by increasing the frequency and severity of flooding events.

## Analysis

Climate change poses significant risks to the Lower Mekong delta's infrastructure, economy, and human population. Rising sea levels and increased precipitation are expected to lead to more frequent and severe flooding events (IPCC, 2022). The region's limited access to safe drinking water and electricity further exacerbates its vulnerability.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors**: Upgrade infrastructure along transport corridors to withstand flooding events.
	* Actors: Government agencies responsible for transportation and infrastructure development
	* Timeframe: Immediate implementation, with a focus on upgrading critical infrastructure within the next 2 years
2. **Sustainable Land Use Practices**: Promote reforestation and agroforestry initiatives to reduce soil erosion and increase water retention.
	* Actors: Local communities, government agencies responsible for land use planning
	* Timeframe: Ongoing implementation, with a focus on scaling up sustainable land use practices within the next 5 years
3. **Early Warning Systems**: Enhance early warning systems for communities living along rivers and coastal areas.
	* Actors: Government agencies responsible for disaster management, local communities
	* Timeframe: Immediate implementation, with a focus on establishing functional early warning systems within the next year

## Implementation Considerations

Implementation of these recommendations will require significant investment in infrastructure development and capacity building. Funding mechanisms such as grants, subsidies, and community-based financing models can be explored to support these efforts.

## Conclusion

The Lower Mekong delta region is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters. Implementing flood-resilient transport corridors, promoting sustainable land use practices, and enhancing early warning systems are critical steps towards supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We urge government officials, NGO leaders, and development practitioners to collaborate on implementing these recommendations.
