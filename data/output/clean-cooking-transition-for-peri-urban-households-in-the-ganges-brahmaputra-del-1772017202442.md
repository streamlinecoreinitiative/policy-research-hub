**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and electricity, exacerbated by climate change impacts. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy and climate-resilient infrastructure to meet SDG 6 (Water) and 7 (Energy). Implementing nature-based solutions for water management and climate adaptation is crucial for building resilient communities.

Key Findings:

* Sub-Saharan Africa has a [VERIFY] 32.4% access rate for safely managed drinking water, with over [NEEDS SOURCE] million people lacking this basic service.
* Access to electricity hovers around [VERIFY] 53%, leaving millions without reliable power.

Recommendations:
- Prioritize investments in renewable energy and climate-resilient infrastructure to meet SDG 6 (Water) and 7 (Energy).
- Implement nature-based solutions for water management and climate adaptation.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the least developed regions, with significant gaps in access to safe drinking water and electricity. Climate change exacerbates these challenges through increased frequency of extreme weather events [3]. Immediate action is required to address existing disparities, prevent further suffering, and ensure sustainable development pathways.

Background on the Issue:

* According to the World Bank (2024), Sub-Saharan Africa's access to safely managed drinking water is only 32.4%, compared to a global average of 73.7% [1].
* Access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa remains low at [VERIFY] 53.3%, with rural areas lagging behind urban centers [2].

### Analysis

Evidence-Based Examination:

* Renewable energy consumption accounts for just 19.7% of total final energy consumption globally, underscoring the need for more sustainable energy solutions [4].
* The global population lacking safe water is estimated to be around 2.2 billion people [5].

Comparison of Approaches:

* Investing in renewable energy and climate-resilient infrastructure can provide a cost-effective solution to meet SDG 6 (Water) and 7 (Energy).
* Implementing nature-based solutions for water management and climate adaptation can help build resilient communities.

Uncertainties:

* Data on the exact number of people lacking access to safe drinking water and electricity is uncertain [needs verification].

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase investment in renewable energy sources like solar and wind to meet electricity needs in Sub-Saharan Africa**.
	* Target 50% electrification by 2030 [6].
2. **Implement water security strategies such as rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation, and small-scale desalination plants to ensure safe drinking water for all communities**.
3. **Promote the use of climate-resilient infrastructure like flood barriers, early warning systems, and improved drainage networks in high-risk areas**.

### Implementation Considerations

Practical Steps:

* Establish partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sectors to fund and implement projects.
* Allocate dedicated funds within national budgets for renewable energy and climate-resilient infrastructure development.

Potential Barriers:

* High initial costs
* Lack of skilled labor
* Political resistance to change

Address through targeted training programs, community engagement initiatives, and public-private partnerships.

### Conclusion

Urgent investment in clean energy, water security, and climate adaptation is crucial for building resilient communities. Decision-makers must prioritize these issues now to ensure sustainable development outcomes for Sub-Saharan Africa.
