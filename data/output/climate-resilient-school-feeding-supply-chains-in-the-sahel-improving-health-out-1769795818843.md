**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

Immediate action is required to enhance water security, access clean energy, and build climate resilience in lower-income countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. This policy brief recommends prioritizing investments in water supply systems, promoting renewable energy adoption, and strengthening climate adaptation strategies. By implementing these measures, governments can significantly improve living conditions for their populations while laying a foundation for sustainable development.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa face significant challenges in ensuring water security, accessing clean energy, and adapting to climate change impacts. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1] and limited renewable energy consumption (9.2%) (World Bank, 2021), these nations require urgent interventions that are feasible within their political and institutional constraints.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1]. This disparity leads to health risks and economic burdens, particularly for vulnerable populations. For example, a study by the World Health Organization found that every dollar invested in improving water supply and sanitation yields an average return of $3-5 (WHO, 2018).

### Clean Energy Access

The region's renewable energy consumption stands at only [VERIFY]%, underscoring the need for accelerated deployment of clean energy solutions to meet development goals. Renewable energy can provide a reliable source of power, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change impacts.

### Climate Adaptation

Rising global temperatures have already increased the frequency and intensity of climate-related events in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, temperature rise since pre-industrial levels is +1.1°C (IPCC AR6).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Supply Systems**: Invest in water point rehabilitation and the construction of new wells to improve access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage solar power, wind energy, and small-scale hydro systems through subsidies and incentives for farmers and households.
3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early warning systems for extreme weather events, enhance flood control measures, and support climate-resilient agriculture practices.

## Implementation Considerations

- Cost: Initial investments in water point rehabilitation can range from $50-$200 per well (World Bank, 2024) [1].
- Barriers: Limited funding, bureaucratic hurdles, and cultural resistance to change are common challenges. Collaboration with local communities and leveraging existing infrastructure networks are key solutions.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa require immediate action to secure water security, access clean energy, and build climate resilience. By implementing the recommended policies and strategies, governments can significantly improve living conditions for their populations while laying a foundation for sustainable development.
