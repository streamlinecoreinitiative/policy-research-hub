# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Sahel: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Sahel region is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and limited access to clean energy. The fisheries sector is particularly affected by cold-chain storage limitations, hindering fish preservation and trade. This brief proposes integrating solar-powered cold-chains into fisheries value chains as a solution to address adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By leveraging renewable energy and sustainable technologies, this initiative can enhance climate resilience, improve livelihoods, and contribute to global development goals.

### Introduction

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity and impacting agricultural productivity in the Sahel region. The fisheries sector is particularly vulnerable due to limited access to cold-chain storage facilities. This brief highlights the need for innovative solutions that address climate-related challenges while promoting sustainable development.

**Key Data Points:**

* Average annual rainfall in the Sahel region ranges from 200-600 mm [verify]
* Precipitation variability is high, with a range of 100-800 mm [verify]
* Traditional cold-chains rely on diesel generators, consuming energy

### Current Cold-Chain Practices

Traditional cold-chain storage facilities in the Sahel region are often energy-intensive and costly. Diesel generators are commonly used to power refrigeration units, leading to high operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

**Key Data Points:**

* Average annual fuel consumption per facility is [verify] tons
* Emissions from diesel generators contribute to climate change, impacting local ecosystems

### Solar-Powered Cold-Chains for Fisheries

The integration of solar-powered cold-chains in fisheries value chains offers a sustainable solution to address adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. This approach leverages renewable energy and reduces reliance on fossil fuels.

**Key Benefits:**

* Renewable energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions and operating costs
* Improved climate resilience enhances livelihoods and contributes to global development goals

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of solar-powered cold-chains in fisheries value chains, policy measures can be implemented:

1. **Incentives for farmers**: Subsidies or low-interest loans can encourage the adoption of renewable energy technologies.
2. **Grid integration**: Microgrids and grid-tie systems can facilitate the connection of solar-powered cold-chains to the national grid.
3. **Infrastructure development**: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure can be developed to support sustainable fisheries.

### Needed Evidence

To further validate the effectiveness of solar-powered cold-chains in fisheries value chains, additional research is needed on:

1. **Climate data**: High-resolution climate datasets for specific regions in the Sahel can inform the design of climate-resilient cold-chains.
2. **Economic analysis**: Cost-benefit analyses and financial viability studies can assess the economic feasibility of solar-powered cold-chains.
3. **Socioeconomic studies**: Local surveys and case studies can evaluate community acceptance and benefits derived from sustainable fisheries practices.

### Closing Outlook

The integration of solar-powered cold-chains in fisheries value chains offers a promising solution to address adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. By leveraging renewable energy and sustainable technologies, this initiative can enhance climate resilience, improve livelihoods, and contribute to the achievement of global development goals.
