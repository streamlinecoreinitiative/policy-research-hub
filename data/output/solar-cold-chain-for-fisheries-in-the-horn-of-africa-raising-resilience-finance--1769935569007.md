**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in West Africa: Strengthening Resilience for Sustainable Development**

## Executive Summary

West Africa faces significant water security challenges, with only 37% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water ([VERIFY] World Bank, 2024). This policy brief highlights the critical need for integrated interventions that address both clean energy and climate adaptation in West Africa. To improve resilience and sustainable development, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy and climate adaptation projects.

## Context & Challenge

West Africa faces severe water scarcity and limited access to clean energy, exacerbating climate impacts. Climate change is intensifying droughts and floods, further straining already scarce resources (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). Water shortages lead to health issues (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), and power outages increase vulnerability among the most marginalized populations.

## Analysis

### Water Security:

* Only [VERIFY] % of West Africans have access to safely managed drinking water ([VERIFY] World Bank, 2024).
* Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at just 32.4% (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This disparity is particularly acute in rural areas.
* Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of global resources (World Bank Open Data, 2021).

### Clean Energy:

* Electricity access stands at [VERIFY] %, affecting millions of people who rely on unreliable power sources like kerosene lamps and solar panels (World Bank, 2023).
* Over 2 billion people globally lack access to electricity (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).
* Renewable energy consumption accounts for only 19.7% of global energy use (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

### Climate Adaptation:

* West Africa is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on rain-fed agriculture and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.
* Climate change has led to a [VERIFY] % reduction in maize yields in Burkina Faso (IFPRI, 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Investment**: Invest in solar panels, wind turbines, and small hydro systems to provide affordable energy solutions for households and communities. Implement feed-in tariffs and subsidies to encourage renewable energy adoption.
2. **Water Security Initiatives**: Support the construction of water storage facilities such as dams, rainwater harvesting tanks, and boreholes equipped with hand pumps. Promote community-based management schemes to ensure sustainable maintenance and use.
3. **Climate Adaptation Programs**: Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters, including droughts and floods. Implement soil conservation practices like terracing and agroforestry to enhance resilience in agricultural sectors.

## Implementation Considerations

* Initial investments can be substantial but yield long-term benefits through reduced health costs (UN-Water/WHO, 2022) and lower operational expenses due to more reliable energy sources.
* Overcoming cultural resistance to change may require community engagement and education campaigns. Financial constraints could be mitigated by leveraging grants from international development partners.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and clean energy in West Africa is crucial for sustainable development and climate resilience. By prioritizing renewable energy investments and robust climate adaptation programs, we can significantly improve the lives of millions in this region.
