# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, with a significant portion of its population residing in peri-urban areas. The region is highly vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns threatening food security, economic stability, and human well-being. This brief focuses on the transition to clean cooking practices for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges

Lower-income countries face significant environmental challenges, including:

*   **Water Security:** Limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities, exacerbating the spread of diseases.
*   **Clean Energy:** High reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
*   **Climate Adaptation:** Insufficient capacity to adapt to climate-related shocks and stresses.

## Supporting Clean Cooking Transition in Peri-Urban Households

The transition to clean cooking practices is crucial for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. This can be achieved through:

*   **Promoting LPG Adoption:** Increasing access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and promoting its use among peri-urban households.
*   **Solar Cooking Initiatives:** Supporting solar cooking programs and providing training on their use.
*   **Biogas Generation:** Encouraging the adoption of biogas generation technologies for household energy needs.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the clean cooking transition in peri-urban households, we recommend:

*   **Subsidies and Incentives:** Providing subsidies and incentives for LPG and solar cooking equipment.
*   **Low-Interest Loans:** Offering low-interest loans to peri-urban households for purchasing clean cooking equipment.
*   **Infrastructure Development:** Investing in infrastructure development, including the expansion of gas pipelines and solar energy systems.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Conduct a Baseline Study:** Conduct a baseline study to assess the current state of clean cooking practices in peri-urban households.
2.  **Develop a Policy Framework:** Develop a policy framework to support the transition to clean cooking practices.
3.  **Establish Partnerships:** Establish partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to promote clean cooking practices.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices is critical for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By supporting adaptation targets in NDCs, we can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance food security. We recommend that governments, NGOs, and private sector entities work together to promote clean cooking practices and support the transition to a more sustainable future.
