**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Central America Dry Corridor: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and resilient infrastructure to combat climate change impacts. This policy brief highlights actionable steps to improve these critical sectors while considering the region's unique constraints and needs.

Key findings:

* Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), exacerbating climate change impacts.
* Investing in clean cooking technologies, water harvesting systems, and microgrids with renewable energy sources can improve health outcomes and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Recommendations:

1. **Clean Cooking Transition**: Invest $X million annually over 5 years to implement biogas digesters and improved cookstoves for peri-urban households.
2. **Water Security**: Implement water harvesting systems and improve sanitation facilities in rural areas, focusing on communities with limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%).
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Develop microgrids with renewable energy sources (solar, wind) in remote communities for reliable electricity supply during droughts.

Call to action: Governments, NGOs, and development partners must prioritize these interventions to enhance resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa's most vulnerable regions.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa has limited access to basic necessities like safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), exacerbating climate change impacts (World Bank Open Data). The region faces severe challenges due to climate variability and population growth, leading to increased water scarcity and power shortages (UN-Water/WHO).

Why it matters now: Addressing these gaps is crucial for sustainable development, food security, and public health.

### Analysis

Data points:

* 73.7% of the world has access to safely managed drinking water, but only 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank Open Data).
* [VERIFY] 19.7% of total final energy consumption is from renewable sources globally, while Sub-Saharan Africa lags at 8.6% (World Bank Open Data).

Evidence: The region faces severe challenges due to climate variability and population growth, leading to increased water scarcity and power shortages.

Analysis: Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, necessitating urgent interventions.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Clean Cooking Transition**: Invest in clean cooking technologies such as biogas digesters and improved cookstoves for peri-urban households to reduce indoor air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
2. **Water Security**: Implement water harvesting systems and improve sanitation facilities, focusing on rural areas where access is most limited (32.4%).
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Develop microgrids with renewable energy sources (solar, wind) in remote communities for reliable electricity supply during droughts.

Implementation Considerations:

* Establish public-private partnerships for project financing.
* Train local technicians in renewable energy installation and maintenance.
* Collaborate with international organizations to share best practices and resources.

### Implementation Considerations

Practical steps:

* Estimate costs at $X million per year to implement these solutions over 5 years. [NEEDS SOURCE]
* Potential barriers include funding constraints and lack of technical expertise.

### Conclusion

Governments, NGOs, and development partners must prioritize these interventions to enhance resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa's most vulnerable regions. Developing comprehensive plans, allocating resources, and engaging stakeholders are essential for effective implementation.
