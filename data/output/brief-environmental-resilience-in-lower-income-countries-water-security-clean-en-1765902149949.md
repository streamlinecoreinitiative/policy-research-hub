# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Harnessing Renewable Energy to Secure Water Supplies in Rural Communities of Sub-Saharan Africa: A Pathway to Environmental Resilience**

**Executive Summary**

Sub-Saharan African regions face significant challenges in securing clean water supplies, exacerbated by climate change impacts like droughts and floods. This brief highlights the critical role renewable energy solutions can play in enhancing both water security and energy access for rural communities. By integrating solar, wind, and hydroelectric power into water management systems, countries can improve desalination plants, irrigation projects, and other essential infrastructure. Successful case studies from Kenya and Ethiopia demonstrate the potential of renewable energy to address water scarcity and climate-related challenges.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Security Challenges**

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately 400 million people living in rural areas, where access to clean drinking water remains a significant challenge (World Bank, 2020). According to UN estimates, over 300 million people lack access to basic sanitation services, while nearly 600 million rely on unimproved or shared sources of water (UNICEF, 2020). Climate change further exacerbates these challenges, with increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods affecting agricultural productivity, food security, and human health.

**Section 2: Impact of Climate Change on Water Supplies**

Climate change has significant implications for water resources in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rising temperatures lead to increased evaporation rates, reduced precipitation, and altered hydrological cycles (IPCC, 2013). Droughts and floods have devastating consequences, including crop failures, livestock deaths, and displacement of communities. For instance, the 2017 drought in Kenya affected over 2 million people, while the 2020 floods in Ethiopia displaced thousands and destroyed critical infrastructure.

**Section 3: Role of Renewable Energy in Enhancing Water Security**

Renewable energy solutions offer a promising pathway to address water security challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can be used to support water management systems like desalination plants or irrigation projects. For example:

• **Solar-powered water treatment**: In Kenya's Turkana County, solar-powered water treatment facilities provide clean drinking water for over 10,000 people.
• **Wind-powered irrigation**: In Ethiopia's Oromia Region, wind turbines power irrigation pumps, increasing crop yields and reducing water usage.

**Section 4: Case Studies and Recommendations**

Successful integration of renewable energy solutions into water security initiatives requires careful consideration of policy frameworks, technology availability, and cost-effectiveness. Key recommendations for policymakers include:

• **Invest in renewable energy infrastructure**: Governments should prioritize investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to support water management systems.
• **Develop supportive policies and regulations**: Policymakers should establish clear guidelines and incentives for the integration of renewable energy solutions into water security initiatives.
• **Promote public-private partnerships**: Collaboration between governments, private sector companies, and local communities can facilitate the adoption of renewable energy technologies.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Conduct detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing renewable energy solutions to traditional methods for water management.
2. Establish a regional platform for knowledge sharing and collaboration on integrated renewable energy and water security projects.
3. Develop a comprehensive policy framework to support the widespread adoption of renewable energy solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa.

**Closing Outlook**

Harnessing renewable energy to secure water supplies in rural communities of Sub-Saharan Africa is a critical step towards environmental resilience. By investing in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, countries can improve water management systems, enhance energy access, and adapt to climate-related challenges. Policymakers, private sector companies, and local communities must work together to address the complex interplay between water security, energy access, and climate change.
