# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

This brief focuses on addressing environmental resilience in lower-income countries through water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change impacts agriculture by causing erratic rainfall patterns. In the Ethiopian Highlands, average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify], with precipitation variability between 600-1400 mm (NOAA climate dataset). Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, consuming a significant amount of energy per borehole pump.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

*   Soil Organic Matter Increases by [verify]%
*   Biodiversity Increase: By [verify] native species
*   Carbon Sequestration: By [verify] tons/ha/year

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a cost-effective solution for climate-resilient water supply. Key data points include:

*   Total Project Cost per hectare is $10,000-$25,000 [verify]
*   Return on Investment (ROI): 3-5 years
*   Long-Term Sustainability Assessments

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Key recommendations include:

*   Subsidies for Farmers: Incentives provided to encourage adoption of integrated systems
*   Grid Integration: Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
*   Infrastructure Development: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  Develop a comprehensive policy framework that includes subsidies for farmers, grid integration, and infrastructure development.
3.  Establish partnerships with international organizations and NGOs to secure funding and technical expertise.

## Closing Outlook

The proposed solution has the potential to address severe water scarcity in lower-income countries by integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. By raising resilience finance for communities and providing a cost-effective solution, this project can contribute to climate adaptation efforts worldwide.
