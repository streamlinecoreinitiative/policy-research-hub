**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Andean Highlands: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

The Andean highlands are highly vulnerable to landslides, which pose a significant threat to the lives and livelihoods of millions of people living in the region. To mitigate this risk, we recommend investing in nature-based solutions such as reforestation, terracing, and wetland restoration. These approaches not only reduce landslide risk but also provide numerous co-benefits including improved water security, enhanced biodiversity, and increased agricultural productivity.

## Context & Challenge

The Andean highlands are characterized by steep terrain, heavy rainfall, and limited infrastructure, making them prone to landslides (World Bank, 2022). The region's population is highly vulnerable to these disasters, with an estimated [VERIFY] % of households affected by landslides in the past decade ([NEEDS SOURCE]). Climate change exacerbates this risk, leading to more frequent and intense rainfall events that increase landslide likelihood.

## Analysis

The current approach to landslide management in the Andean highlands is largely reactive, focusing on post-disaster response rather than prevention. This approach is unsustainable, as it not only fails to address the root causes of landslides but also places a significant burden on already strained local resources (World Bank, 2022). In contrast, nature-based solutions offer a proactive and sustainable approach to landslide risk reduction.

* Water Security:
	+ The Andean highlands are characterized by limited access to safe drinking water, with an estimated [VERIFY] % of households lacking access to improved water sources ([NEEDS SOURCE]).
	+ Reforestation and terracing can help improve water security by reducing soil erosion and increasing water retention.
* Clean Energy Access:
	+ The region's energy mix is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, with an estimated 70% of households lacking access to electricity (World Bank, 2023).
	+ Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power can provide a cleaner and more sustainable alternative.
* Climate Adaptation:
	+ Climate change is projected to increase landslide risk in the Andean highlands by up to [VERIFY] % by 2050 ([NEEDS SOURCE]).
	+ Nature-based solutions can help communities adapt to climate change by reducing vulnerability to extreme weather events.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in reforestation and terracing programs**: Work with local communities and governments to establish large-scale reforestation and terracing initiatives that reduce landslide risk while improving water security and agricultural productivity.
2. **Promote renewable energy adoption**: Encourage the installation of solar panels, wind turbines, and small hydropower projects to increase access to clean energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
3. **Develop early warning systems for landslides**: Establish a network of sensors and monitoring systems that provide early warnings of landslide risk, allowing communities to prepare and respond effectively.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Initial investments in nature-based solutions can be significant but will likely yield long-term benefits through reduced disaster losses and improved livelihoods.
* Potential Barriers: Limited funding, lack of technical capacity, and conflicting land-use priorities are key obstacles that must be addressed for successful implementation.
* Practical Steps: Collaborate with local communities, engage private sector partners, and secure international aid to overcome these challenges.

## Conclusion

The Andean highlands are highly vulnerable to landslides, which pose a significant threat to the lives and livelihoods of millions of people living in the region. To mitigate this risk, we recommend investing in nature-based solutions such as reforestation, terracing, and wetland restoration. These approaches not only reduce landslide risk but also provide numerous co-benefits including improved water security, enhanced biodiversity, and increased agricultural productivity.
