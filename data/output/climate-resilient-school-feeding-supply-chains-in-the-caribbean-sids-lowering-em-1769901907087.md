**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Caribbean SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Boosting climate resilience in the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) requires a comprehensive approach to address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges. Our policy brief highlights the critical sectors of school feeding supply chains as an entry point for reducing emissions. We recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy, improving water management practices, and enhancing climate resilience through integrated planning.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4%) [1] and reliable electricity (53.3%) [2], despite global coverage of 73.7% [3] and 91.6%, respectively [4]. The region's reliance on rain-fed agriculture and limited access to alternative energy sources like solar power exacerbate climate change impacts, including increased drought frequency and intensity [5].

## Analysis

Climate change affects water security in Sub-Saharan Africa by increasing drought frequency and intensity (IPCC, 2022) [6]. This region is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on rain-fed agriculture and limited access to alternative energy sources. The cost of solar panels has decreased significantly over the past decade, making it a viable option for off-grid areas [7].

## Policy Recommendations

### Recommendation #1: Enhance Water Security

* Invest in infrastructure projects like boreholes, pipelines, and rainwater harvesting systems in rural areas.
* Implement community-based water management programs focused on hygiene education and sustainable practices (World Bank, 2023) [8].
* Source: World Bank Open Data.

### Recommendation #2: Promote Clean Energy Solutions

* Encourage public-private partnerships to deploy solar-powered microgrids for off-grid communities.
* Provide subsidies or grants for the purchase of renewable energy systems in remote areas (IRENA, 2021) [9].
* Source: IRENA Report.

### Recommendation #3: Strengthen Climate Resilience Initiatives

* Integrate climate change adaptation strategies into national development plans and local community programs.
* Collaborate with international organizations for technical assistance and financial support (UNDP, 2022) [10].
* Source: UNDP Global Development Data Hub.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial capital investments in water infrastructure can range from $10-$20 per person [11], while solar microgrids cost approximately $30-$40 per household [12]. Limited financial resources and political will are major obstacles to implementing these projects. Collaboration with local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is crucial for successful implementation.

## Conclusion

Boosting climate resilience in the Caribbean SIDS requires a comprehensive approach to address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges. By adopting evidence-based policies and overcoming current barriers, we can create a more sustainable future for the region.
