# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and increasing frequency of extreme weather events. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a key strategy for supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into irrigation practices, communities can improve water security, enhance energy efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges

*   **Water Scarcity:** Erratic rainfall patterns, droughts, and increased evaporation due to climate change exacerbate water scarcity.
*   **Energy Access:** Limited access to reliable energy sources hinders economic development and increases reliance on diesel generators.
*   **Climate Change Impacts:** Rising temperatures, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events threaten food security, livelihoods, and ecosystems.

## Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils: A Key Strategy

*   **Benefits of Agroforestry:** Improved soil health, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and water retention.
*   **Micro-Hydro Systems:** Reduced energy costs, increased efficiency, and decreased reliance on diesel generators.
*   **Community Engagement:** Empowering indigenous councils to manage watersheds, ensuring equitable access to resources.

## Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

*   **Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro:** Pilot projects demonstrating cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.
*   **Policy Recommendations:**
    *   Support community-led watershed management initiatives
    *   Provide technical assistance for agroforestry-based micro-hydro system implementation
    *   Promote policy frameworks that prioritize climate resilience and energy access

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Support Community-Led Initiatives:** Empower indigenous councils to manage watersheds, ensuring equitable access to resources.
2.  **Provide Technical Assistance:** Offer training and technical support for agroforestry-based micro-hydro system implementation.
3.  **Promote Policy Frameworks:** Encourage policy frameworks that prioritize climate resilience and energy access.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils is a critical strategy for supporting adaptation targets in NDCs. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into irrigation practices, communities can improve water security, enhance energy efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is essential to support community-led initiatives, provide technical assistance, and promote policy frameworks that prioritize climate resilience and energy access.
