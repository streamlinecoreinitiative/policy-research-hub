# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy Adoption, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issues of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend implementing targeted interventions for improved water management, renewable energy adoption, and climate adaptation. This can be achieved through a multi-stakeholder approach involving governments, international organizations, and local communities.

Key findings:

* Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data).
* Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, leading to increased droughts and floods.
* Urgent action is needed to address these pressing issues.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges with regards to water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. The region's population continues to grow, placing additional pressure on existing infrastructure and natural resources. Climate change further strains these resources, making it essential for governments and international organizations to take immediate action (IPCC 2020).

Recent data highlights the urgency of the situation:

* Access to safely managed drinking water (%): [VERIFY] 32.4% (Sub-Saharan Africa) vs. 73.7% (World) (World Bank Open Data).
* Electricity access (% of population): [VERIFY] 53.3% (Sub-Saharan Africa) vs. 91.6% (World) (World Bank Open Data).

## Analysis

The analysis reveals a significant gap in water security and clean energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to the global average.

	+ Sub-Saharan Africa: 32.4% [Source: World Bank Open Data]
* Electricity access (% of population):
	+ World: 91.6% [Source: World Bank Open Data]

Climate change impacts are also evident:

* Freshwater withdrawal (% of resources): 9.2% (World) [Source: World Bank Open Data]
* Global population lacking safe water: [NEEDS SOURCE] 2.2 billion people

## Policy Recommendations

We recommend the following targeted interventions to address these pressing issues:

1. **Invest in infrastructure projects**:
	* Invest in boreholes and pipelines to provide clean water sources.
	* Promote community-led initiatives for water management, including rainwater harvesting and sanitation facilities.
2. **Expand renewable energy adoption**:
	* Encourage the use of solar panels in rural areas through subsidization programs or grants.
	* Develop mini-grid systems that can serve isolated communities without requiring extensive grid expansion.
3. **Enhance climate adaptation measures**:
	* Implement early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.
	* Promote resilient agricultural practices to mitigate the impact of climate change on food security.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementation will require a multi-stakeholder approach involving governments, international organizations, and local communities. Practical steps include:

1. Developing detailed implementation plans with clear timelines and resource allocations.
2. Estimating costs: Water security projects may range from $2-3 billion, while solar energy subsidies could cost approximately [VERIFY] $100 million per year over a 10-year period.
3. Overcoming barriers: Political resistance, lack of funding, inadequate infrastructure, and community resistance.

## Conclusion

The urgent need for action is evident in the data presented above. We recommend that governments and international organizations take immediate action to address these pressing issues through targeted interventions for improved water management, renewable energy adoption, and climate adaptation. A comprehensive strategy with clear policy directives and resource commitments from national governments and international partners is essential for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa.
