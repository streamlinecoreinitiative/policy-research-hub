**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the pressing need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite progress, [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population lacks access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), while [VERIFY] 53.3% remain without electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023). To address these issues, we recommend:

1. **Investing in pipeline infrastructure** to improve access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promoting renewable energy**, particularly solar-powered mini-grids and community-owned micro-hydro projects.
3. **Strengthening climate resilience** through early warning systems, climate-resilient agricultural practices, and disaster risk reduction plans.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate change. The region's population is projected to reach 2 billion by 2050 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division), exacerbating existing issues. Water scarcity, inadequate sanitation facilities, and poor infrastructure contribute to the limited access to safe drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Inadequate electricity access hinders economic growth and development, particularly in rural areas (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

### Analysis

#### **Water Security**

Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), compared to the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of the world's resources (World Bank Open Data, 2021).

#### **Clean Energy Access**

Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in terms of electricity access, with only [VERIFY] 53.3% of the population having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023), compared to 91.6% globally (World Bank Open Data, 2023). Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% worldwide (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

#### **Climate Adaptation**

The region faces increased frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters such as droughts, floods, and landslides, threatening water resources and energy systems.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Invest in pipeline infrastructure to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Promote rainwater harvesting and small-scale irrigation projects for sustainable water management.
	* Collaborate with NGOs and community-based organizations to build capacity for water resource management.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**:
	* Encourage the use of solar-powered mini-grids in rural areas where grid extension is not feasible.
	* Implement feed-in tariffs and subsidies to incentivize renewable energy investments by households and small businesses.
	* Develop community-owned micro-hydro projects for decentralized electricity generation.
3. **Strengthen Climate Resilience**:
	* Invest in early warning systems for climate-related disasters, particularly focusing on drought monitoring and flood mitigation.
	* Support the development of climate-resilient agricultural practices through research and extension services.
	* Develop disaster risk reduction plans that integrate water management strategies to reduce vulnerability.

### Implementation Considerations

Initial investments will be significant but can be offset by long-term benefits, including improved health outcomes, increased economic productivity, and reduced disaster losses. Addressing potential barriers such as political resistance, lack of funding, and inadequate technical expertise requires targeted training programs and financial incentives for local stakeholders.

### Conclusion

Ensuring water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for achieving sustainable development goals. By implementing the recommended policies and addressing potential barriers, governments can create a more resilient future for their populations.
