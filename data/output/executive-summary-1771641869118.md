# Executive Summary

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing water security challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $10 billion over the next decade to implement community-based water supply systems, promote solar-powered desalination plants, and enhance climate adaptation strategies. This investment will ensure equitable access to safe drinking water for 90% of the population by 2030, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and build resilience against climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water security challenges with only [VERIFY] 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This is a significant gap compared to the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2024). The region's limited electricity access (53.3%) exacerbates these issues, hindering economic development and climate adaptation efforts (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

## Analysis

Water scarcity and inadequate sanitation infrastructure contribute to health issues like waterborne diseases, particularly among vulnerable populations. Limited access to electricity hinders economic development, limiting industries that could create employment opportunities. It also undermines efforts in climate adaptation by reducing the availability of energy needed for water treatment and desalination.

Climate change exacerbates these challenges, with increased frequency of droughts and floods affecting both water supply and energy production (IPCC, 2021). The global population lacking safe water is estimated to be [VERIFY] 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), highlighting the need for urgent action.

## Policy Recommendations

### Water Security

1. **Invest in community-based water supply systems**: Implement boreholes, rainwater harvesting tanks, and piped networks to ensure equitable access to safe drinking water.
	* Cost: $5 billion over 10 years
	* Expected outcome: [VERIFY] 90% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water by 2030
2. **Promote solar-powered desalination plants**: Reduce reliance on fossil fuels and build resilience against climate-related disasters.
	* Cost: $3 billion over 10 years
	* Expected outcome: [VERIFY] 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from water treatment by 2035

### Clean Energy Access

1. **Implement solar-powered micro-grids**: Electrify rural areas and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
	* Cost: $2 billion over 10 years
	* Expected outcome: [VERIFY] 70% of rural households have access to electricity by 2028

### Climate Adaptation

1. **Enhance climate adaptation strategies**: Implement early warning systems for droughts and floods, along with resilient agricultural practices like agroforestry value chains in cash crops.
	* Cost: $500 million over 10 years
	* Expected outcome: [VERIFY] 50% reduction in crop losses due to climate-related disasters by 2035

## Implementation Considerations

Addressing these challenges will require significant investment and strategic planning. Potential barriers include political resistance to change, limited funding, and technical expertise. To overcome these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Grants and concessional loans**: Secure funding from international organizations and governments.
2. **Partnerships between governments and international organizations**: Leverage expertise and resources to implement projects.
3. **Strong advocacy and strategic planning**: Address political resistance and limited funding through effective communication and planning.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address its water security and clean energy access gaps through targeted interventions. By prioritizing climate-resilient infrastructure and renewable energy solutions, governments can build a more sustainable future for their populations. Continuous monitoring and adaptation will be crucial to ensure success in these critical areas.
