**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: A Resilient Path Forward for Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring access to clean water and electricity while mitigating the impacts of climate change. This brief highlights actionable steps governments and NGOs can take to improve resilience in these critical areas. We recommend investing in cost-effective water security measures, promoting renewable energy adoption, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

Key findings:

* Lower-income countries struggle with [VERIFY] access to safely managed drinking water (Sub-Saharan Africa) and only [VERIFY] access to electricity (Sub-Saharan Africa). Climate change exacerbates these challenges.
* Implementing cost-effective water security measures, promoting renewable energy adoption, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies can improve resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries are disproportionately affected by water scarcity, lack of clean drinking water, and inadequate access to electricity. These issues compound the impacts of climate change, including more frequent droughts and extreme weather events. According to the World Bank (2024), Sub-Saharan Africa has only [32.4%] access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally. Similarly, the region lags in electricity access with just [53.3%] coverage (World Bank, 2023), versus 91.6% worldwide.

## Analysis

**Water Security**

Limited water resources are exacerbated by climate change, leading to increased drought frequency and severity. Sub-Saharan Africa’s access to safe drinking water is far below global averages. The World Bank (2024) reports that [2.2 billion people globally lack safe water] (UN-Water/WHO), with the majority residing in lower-income countries.

**Clean Energy**

Renewable energy consumption in the region remains low at 19.7% (World Bank, 2020), underscoring the need for more investment and policy support to transition away from fossil fuels.

**Climate Adaptation**

The region lacks robust climate adaptation measures, leaving communities vulnerable to rising sea levels, desertification, and other environmental impacts. The SDG 6 progress report (UN SDG Report 2023) indicates that safely managed water coverage is at 74% globally, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in lower-income countries.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security**:
	* Invest in rainwater harvesting systems, boreholes, and water purification technologies to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Implement water pricing reforms that encourage efficient use of resources while ensuring affordability for vulnerable populations.
2. **Clean Energy**:
	* Prioritize renewable energy projects such as solar panels, small hydro plants, and wind turbines in rural areas where grid connections are limited.
	* Encourage public-private partnerships to finance and manage these initiatives, leveraging grants and concessional loans from international development banks.
3. **Climate Adaptation**:
	* Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters like floods and droughts using satellite imagery and ground-based sensors.
	* Implement land use planning that incorporates climate resilience measures such as afforestation and agroforestry to mitigate the impacts of climate change on freshwater ecosystems.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in water security and clean energy projects can be substantial, but long-term savings from reduced healthcare costs due to improved sanitation and increased productivity will offset these expenses. Political instability, corruption, and limited technical capacity may hinder implementation. Addressing these issues through targeted training programs and anti-corruption measures is crucial.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries requires concerted efforts by governments, NGOs, and development partners. By adopting the recommendations outlined here, stakeholders can enhance resilience and improve living standards for vulnerable populations.
