# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: A Strategy for Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by frequent droughts and water scarcity. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a strategy to stabilize food security in these areas. By integrating agroforestry practices with micro-hydro systems, communities can improve irrigation efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and enhance resilience to climate-related shocks.

## Introduction

The Sudano-Sahelian belt spans across several countries in West Africa, including Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. This region is characterized by a semi-arid climate with limited rainfall, making it prone to droughts and water scarcity. Climate change has exacerbated these conditions, impacting agricultural productivity and food security.

### Key Data Points

* Average annual rainfall: [verify] mm (data for selected regions)
* Precipitation variability (annual range): 600-1400 mm
* Water loss percentages from traditional irrigation systems:
	+ Evaporation: 30%
	+ Seepage: 5% (estimated)

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation methods in the Sudano-Sahelian belt are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems experience significant water loss due to evaporation and seepage.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

* Soil organic matter: 2-8% (estimated)
* Biodiversity increase: [verify] native species
* Carbon sequestration: 3-7 tons/ha/year (estimated)

Case studies from other regions demonstrate the successful implementation of agroforestry systems.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Specific data includes:

* Power generation: [verify] kW per system
* Energy efficiency: 70-80%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods (estimated)

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. Estimated costs range from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions:

* Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Establish watershed co-management committees** with indigenous councils to oversee the implementation of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Develop and disseminate training programs** for farmers on sustainable irrigation practices, including micro-hydro system maintenance and operation.
3. **Provide incentives** for farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils offers a promising approach to stabilizing food security during droughts in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By integrating agroforestry practices with micro-hydro systems, communities can improve irrigation efficiency and enhance resilience to climate-related shocks. Policy measures and future research directions are crucial for scaling up these initiatives.
