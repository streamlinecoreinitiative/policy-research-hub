**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Indus Watershed: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issues of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend that governments prioritize infrastructure development, policy reform, and international support. Specifically, we advocate for investing $500 million to $1 billion per project in desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and improved sanitation facilities to increase water security. Additionally, we suggest increasing renewable energy deployment through subsidies, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships to boost the 19.7% of total final energy consumption from renewables.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is a region characterized by high population density (approximately [VERIFY] % of the total population) coupled with limited resources for sustainable development. Water scarcity affects approximately [NEEDS SOURCE] people, while only 32.4% have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). Additionally, electricity coverage stands at 53.3%, leaving millions without reliable power during extreme weather events (World Bank Open Data).

Climate change intensifies these challenges by increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, floods, and other natural disasters. Without robust adaptation measures, Sub-Saharan Africa risks further deterioration in health outcomes, economic stability, and social cohesion.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Approximately 2.2 billion people globally lack safe drinking water (UN-Water/WHO), with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for about 32.4% of the region’s population without such access.
- **Clean Energy Access**: Only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan African populations have reliable electricity, highlighting significant gaps in infrastructure and policy support.

These statistics underscore the critical need to improve water security and clean energy access within the region. Additionally, renewable energy consumption remains low at just 19.7%, indicating substantial room for growth and investment in sustainable energy solutions (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Supply Infrastructure**: Invest $500 million to $1 billion per project in desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and improved sanitation facilities to increase water security.
2. **Renewable Energy Deployment**: Increase renewable energy deployment through subsidies, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships to boost the 19.7% of total final energy consumption from renewables.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Implement early warning systems for extreme weather events, develop drought-resistant crops, and enhance water management practices.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Estimated costs for infrastructure development range between $500 million to $1 billion per project, with renewable energy deployment costing approximately 2% of GDP annually.
- **Barriers**: Political instability, corruption, and limited financial resources can hinder implementation. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between governments, international organizations, and local communities.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for sustainable development and poverty reduction. By implementing the recommended policy measures, stakeholders can enhance resilience and improve living standards for millions of people. Next steps include securing funding, fostering partnerships, and monitoring progress to ensure successful implementation.
