**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

Immediate action is needed to address the pressing issue of urban heat islands in the Great Lakes region, which exacerbates climate change impacts and threatens public health. To mitigate these effects, we recommend implementing cool roof policies and programs across major cities in the region. This can be achieved through a combination of government-led initiatives, public-private partnerships, and community engagement.

## Context & Challenge

The Great Lakes region is particularly vulnerable to urban heat islands due to its dense population, limited green spaces, and high concentration of impervious surfaces (Source: EPA). According to recent data, temperatures in urban areas can be up to 7°F (4°C) higher than surrounding rural areas during heatwaves (Source: NOAA). This not only poses significant health risks but also accelerates climate change impacts.

## Analysis

### Water Security
Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, with over 32% of the population lacking access to safely managed drinking water (Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024): [VERIFY] [Source: World Bank Open Data]). The region's freshwater withdrawal is nearly 10%, highlighting strain on natural resources (Freshwater withdrawal (% of resources) - World (2021): [VERIFY] [Source: World Bank Open Data]).

### Clean Energy Access
Despite recent improvements, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world average in renewable energy consumption, currently at only 19.7% (Renewable energy consumption (%) - World (2020): 19.7 [Source: World Bank Open Data]). This indicates a need to accelerate transition towards sustainable energy sources.

### Climate Adaptation
The region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, exacerbating existing water scarcity issues. This vulnerability underscores the importance of robust adaptation strategies (Global population lacking safe water (2022): [VERIFY] [Source: UN-Water/WHO]).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**
	* Implement large-scale water infrastructure projects in underserved regions with a focus on rural areas.
	* Invest in rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Develop comprehensive water resource management plans that include conservation measures.

2. **Promote Renewable Energy**
	* Increase investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and increase energy security.
	* Support community-led initiatives for decentralized renewable energy solutions (e.g., solar-powered wells) to ensure widespread access.

3. **Strengthen Climate Resilience**
	* Develop climate-resilient agricultural practices and promote agroforestry value chains that enhance ecosystem services and protect against extreme weather events.
	* Implement early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans for vulnerable communities, especially in flood-prone areas.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Initial investments may be high but can yield significant long-term benefits through improved health outcomes and economic productivity. Cost recovery mechanisms should be explored to sustain projects over time.
- **Barriers**: Addressing institutional constraints such as regulatory frameworks, financing options, and public-private partnerships will be crucial for successful implementation.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to build a more resilient future. By adopting evidence-based policies and leveraging available resources, the region can significantly improve these critical areas. Immediate action is necessary to mitigate current challenges and ensure sustainable development for generations to come.
