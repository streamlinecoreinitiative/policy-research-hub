**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Great Lakes Region: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region faces significant challenges in accessing clean water, electricity, and adapting to climate change impacts. To address these issues, we recommend that governments increase funding for water supply infrastructure in rural areas, implement community-based water management systems, and provide subsidies and training for small-scale water treatment technologies. Additionally, investing in solar-powered mini-grids can electrify remote communities, while developing policies encouraging the adoption of renewable energy by households and businesses can promote clean energy use.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to clean water (32.4%) [1] and electricity (53.3%) [2], leading to health risks and economic disparities. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by intensifying droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events [3]. The region's population is projected to reach 2.5 billion by 2050, putting further pressure on already strained resources [4].

## Analysis

Access to safely managed drinking water is a critical issue in Sub-Saharan Africa, with only 32.4% of the population having access to this basic service [1]. This leads to higher rates of waterborne diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera [5]. Renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7%, despite significant potential for growth through solar, wind, and hydro projects [6].

## Policy Recommendations

### Safe Drinking Water Access:

* Increase funding for water supply infrastructure in rural areas (2025-2030)
* Implement community-based water management systems (e.g., rainwater harvesting) (2025-2030)
* Provide subsidies and training for small-scale water treatment technologies (2025-2030)

### Renewable Energy Use:

* Invest in solar-powered mini-grids to electrify remote communities (2025-2030)
* Develop policies encouraging the adoption of renewable energy by households and businesses (2025-2030)
* Support grid modernization projects with government grants or incentives (2025-2030)

### Climate Adaptation Measures:

* Strengthen early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events (2025-2030)
* Promote disaster-resistant infrastructure designs in water supply and energy sectors (2025-2030)
* Encourage research on climate-resilient agricultural practices (2025-2030)

## Implementation Considerations

Governments should allocate dedicated funds to these initiatives, with NGOs providing technical assistance and community engagement support. Initial investments will be substantial but yield long-term benefits, including improved public health and economic growth.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa needs concerted action to ensure sustainable water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. By adopting the recommendations outlined here, governments can make significant strides towards achieving these goals.

**Call to Action**

Engage stakeholders from government, NGOs, and the private sector in planning and implementing these interventions. Collaborative efforts are essential for overcoming political constraints and ensuring successful implementation.
