**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in Caribbean SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

Lower-income countries, particularly those in the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), face significant challenges in accessing clean energy and water security. This policy brief highlights the critical need to transition peri-urban households towards cleaner cooking practices, emphasizing the importance of renewable energy sources, climate-resilient infrastructure, and sustainable development strategies.

**Key Findings:**

*   Lower-income countries struggle with limited access to electricity (53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and safe drinking water (32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa) [Source: World Bank Open Data].
*   The Caribbean SIDS are particularly vulnerable due to their geography, economic constraints, and high reliance on fossil fuels.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Expand Access to Clean Energy**: Invest in renewable energy projects such as solar and wind power to increase electricity access in rural areas.
2.  **Enhance Water Security**: Develop climate-resilient infrastructure like rainwater harvesting systems and improve access to safe drinking water through desalination plants or improved filtration technologies.
3.  **Support Climate Adaptation Programs**: Develop early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans, integrating climate resilience into urban planning and infrastructure design.

### Context & Challenge

The Caribbean SIDS are highly susceptible to climate change impacts due to their geographical location, economic constraints, and high reliance on fossil fuels. The region faces significant challenges in accessing clean energy and water security:

*   **Access to Electricity**: Only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data], with the Caribbean SIDS facing similar challenges.
*   **Safe Drinking Water**: The global average for safely managed drinking water is 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data], while Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at 32.4% [Source: World Bank Open Data].

### Analysis

The current state of energy and water security in lower-income countries reveals significant gaps that must be addressed:

*   **Access to Electricity**: Renewable energy consumption is low, with just 19.7% of final energy coming from renewables globally [Source: World Bank Open Data].
*   **Safe Drinking Water**: The global average for safely managed drinking water is 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data], while Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate infrastructure.

### Policy Recommendations

1.  **Expand Access to Clean Energy**:
    *   Invest in renewable energy projects such as solar and wind power to increase electricity access in rural areas.
    *   Governments should collaborate with international development partners to fund these initiatives.
2.  **Enhance Water Security**:
    *   Develop climate-resilient infrastructure like rainwater harvesting systems and improve access to safe drinking water through desalination plants or improved filtration technologies.
    *   NGOs should partner with local communities to implement these solutions.
3.  **Support Climate Adaptation Programs**:
    *   Develop early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans, integrating climate resilience into urban planning and infrastructure design.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these policies will require substantial investment, including both public and private sector contributions:

*   **Costs and Funding Sources**: The World Bank estimates that it costs approximately $50 million per year to build a solar-powered water purification plant capable of serving up to 10,000 people.
*   **Barriers and Mitigation Strategies**: Potential barriers include limited financial resources, bureaucratic hurdles, and resistance from local communities who may not see immediate benefits.

### Conclusion

Enhancing energy and water security in lower-income countries is essential for sustainable development. By focusing on evidence-based solutions that are both feasible and cost-effective, governments and NGOs can make significant progress towards achieving these goals. Let us commit to protecting livelihoods under climate stress by investing in renewable energy sources, climate-resilient infrastructure, and sustainable development strategies.

### Background Information

**Environment**

The natural environment refers to all living and non-living things occurring naturally, along with the physical and biological factors that impact on any organism or a group of organisms.

**Resilience**

Resilience is the ability of an individual, community, or system to withstand, recover from, or adapt in response to adversity, trauma, or stress.
