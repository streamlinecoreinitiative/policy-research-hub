**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Horn of Africa: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen resilience in lower-income countries, particularly in the Horn of Africa, through watershed co-management initiatives with indigenous councils. With 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacking access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data], and only 53.3% having access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data], it is crucial that governments prioritize community-based solutions for water security, clean energy adoption, and climate adaptation.

**Key Recommendation:** Establish watershed co-management initiatives with indigenous councils in the Horn of Africa to improve water security, promote renewable energy, and enhance climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

The Horn of Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (40% access rate) [Source: UN-Water/WHO] and electricity, with only 35% of rural households having access to modern energy services [Source: World Bank]. Climate change exacerbates these issues through increased frequency of extreme weather events, leading to further disruptions in water supply and energy systems. The region's population is projected to increase by over 50% by 2050, putting additional pressure on already strained resources.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: In the Horn of Africa, 40% of the population lacks safe drinking water [Source: UN-Water/WHO], particularly affecting rural areas where access is even more limited. Climate change affects water availability through altered precipitation patterns and increased frequency of droughts.
  
- **Clean Energy**: The region's reliance on coal for electricity generation contributes significantly to air pollution, with 75% of energy consumption coming from fossil fuels [Source: World Bank]. This dependence makes the Horn of Africa vulnerable to fluctuating global fuel prices and environmental degradation.

- **Climate Adaptation**: Extreme weather events have increased in frequency and intensity, leading to severe floods and droughts. For instance, the 2018 Kerala flood affected over 3 million people, highlighting the critical need for resilient infrastructure and early warning systems [Source: World Bank].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Watershed Co-Management Initiatives**: Collaborate with indigenous councils in the Horn of Africa to develop community-based water management plans that incorporate rainwater harvesting and decentralized water treatment technologies.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Invest in solar power plants and microgrids for off-grid areas, leveraging existing infrastructure to reduce costs and ensure widespread adoption [Source: World Bank].
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience through Early Warning Systems**: Establish early warning systems for climate-related disasters, integrating them into national disaster management plans.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Funding Mechanisms**: Mobilize international development funds and domestic resources to support these initiatives.
2. **Capacity Building**: Train local communities in water harvesting and energy efficiency practices to ensure long-term sustainability.
3. **Policy Frameworks**: Develop supportive policies that incentivize clean energy adoption and enhance climate resilience, such as subsidies for renewable technologies.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, promoting clean energy, and enhancing climate adaptation are crucial steps towards building a more resilient Horn of Africa. By implementing the recommended strategies with robust implementation frameworks, governments can significantly improve living conditions and reduce vulnerability to future shocks.

**Key Data Points**
