# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, with increasing temperatures and heatwaves posing significant health risks to peri-urban households. This brief explores the transition to clean cooking practices as a critical component of environmental resilience in lower-income countries.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity and Health Risks**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is characterized by limited access to WASH facilities, contributing to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, and typhoid fever. The region's growing peri-urban population faces unique challenges in accessing clean cooking fuels, with many relying on biomass or charcoal for energy.

**Section 2: Current Cooking Practices and Challenges**

*   **Cooking Fuels:** Biomass (54%), charcoal (24%), and LPG (22%) are the primary cooking fuels used in peri-urban households. [verify]
*   **Health Impacts:** Indoor air pollution from biomass and charcoal combustion contributes to significant respiratory illnesses, but a specific number of premature deaths annually is not provided.
*   **Water Scarcity:** Limited access to clean water for cooking and hygiene purposes perpetuates the cycle of poverty and poor health outcomes.

**Section 3: Transitioning to Clean Cooking Practices**

The transition to clean cooking practices requires a multi-faceted approach:

*   **Solar Cookers:** Promote the use of solar cookers, which can reduce IAP by up to [verify] %.
*   **Biogas Systems:** Implement biogas systems that convert organic waste into fuel, reducing reliance on biomass and charcoal.
*   **LPG Adoption:** Encourage LPG adoption through targeted subsidies and public awareness campaigns.

**Section 4: Climate Adaptation and Water Security**

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. To address this challenge:

*   **Rainwater Harvesting:** Implement rainwater harvesting systems to collect and store clean water for cooking, hygiene, and other household needs.
*   **Water-Efficient Appliances:** Promote the use of water-efficient appliances and cookware that reduce energy consumption.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Develop targeted subsidies and incentives for households transitioning to clean cooking practices.
2.  Establish public awareness campaigns highlighting the health benefits and economic advantages of clean cooking.
3.  Invest in infrastructure development, including solar cooker manufacturing facilities and biogas system installation.
4.  Foster partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to support the transition to clean cooking.

**Closing Outlook**

The transition to clean cooking practices is critical for improving health outcomes in peri-urban households of the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By integrating water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies, we can reduce IAP, improve access to clean water, and promote sustainable development in this vulnerable region.
