# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sahel: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sahel: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region faces severe environmental degradation due to climate change, overgrazing, and poor land management practices. Watersheds are crucial for providing freshwater ecosystems, supporting agriculture, and sustaining livelihoods. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a key strategy for safeguarding freshwater ecosystems in the Sahel.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sahel**

The Sahel region is characterized by arid and semi-arid conditions, with limited water resources. Climate change has exacerbated droughts, affecting agriculture, livestock, and human settlements. The region's population relies heavily on groundwater for irrigation, drinking, and other domestic uses.

* **Climate Data:**
	+ [Verify] Average annual rainfall in the Sahel region varies by country (source needed)
	+ Precipitation variability is high due to interannual and intra-seasonal changes
* **Water Loss Percentages:**
	+ Evaporation: 30-50% (estimated, source needed)
	+ Seepage: 10-20% (estimated, source needed)

**Section 2: Current Water Management Practices and Challenges**

Traditional water management practices in the Sahel focus on irrigation, livestock watering, and domestic use. However, these practices often lead to over-extraction of groundwater, degradation of watersheds, and decreased water quality.

* **Current Irrigation Methods:**
	+ Borehole pumps are used for irrigation (no specific energy consumption data available)
	+ Canal systems experience water loss due to evaporation and seepage
* **Economic Impact Assessment:**
	+ Cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods is not well-documented; further research is needed

**Section 3: Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils**

Watershed co-management involves the participation of local communities, indigenous councils, and other stakeholders in decision-making processes related to water resource management. This approach has been successfully implemented in various regions worldwide.

* **Benefits of Watershed Co-management:**
	+ Improved water quality
	+ Enhanced watershed resilience
	+ Increased community engagement and ownership
* **Case Studies:**
	+ Successful implementation of watershed co-management projects in West Africa (e.g., Niger, Burkina Faso)
	+ Indigenous council-led initiatives for sustainable water management in East Africa (e.g., Kenya, Tanzania)

**Section 4: Integration with Sustainable Land Management Practices**

Watershed co-management should be integrated with sustainable land management practices to ensure long-term ecosystem health and resilience.

* **Sustainable Land Management Practices:**
	+ Agroforestry
	+ Conservation agriculture
	+ Rangeland rehabilitation
* **Benefits of Integrated Approaches:**
	+ Enhanced water retention
	+ Improved soil fertility
	+ Increased biodiversity

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  Support the development of watershed co-management plans with indigenous councils and local communities.
2.  Promote sustainable land management practices (agroforestry, conservation agriculture, rangeland rehabilitation) to enhance ecosystem resilience.
3.  Encourage policy makers to adopt policies supporting watershed co-management and sustainable land management.

**Closing Outlook**

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils is a crucial strategy for safeguarding freshwater ecosystems in the Sahel region. By integrating this approach with sustainable land management practices, we can ensure long-term ecosystem health and resilience. It is essential to support policy makers in adopting policies that promote watershed co-management and sustainable land management practices.
