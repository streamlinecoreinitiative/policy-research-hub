# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Mekong Basin: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Mekong Basin is a disaster-prone region facing severe landslide risks exacerbated by climate change. This brief presents a nature-based solution to mitigate these risks through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in lower-income countries.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mekong Basin

Climate change is impacting agriculture in the region, leading to water scarcity. Resilient irrigation methods are crucial for food security and economic stability. Existing irrigation systems suffer from high water loss percentages due to evaporation and seepage.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has numerous benefits for soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry improves water retention and reduces erosion. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can create a climate-resilient water supply.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology involves small-scale hydroelectric systems that reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency. Pilot projects showcase the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro, highlighting cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support adoption at scale, we recommend:

* Integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems into national policies
* Providing training and capacity-building programs for farmers and policymakers
* Conducting further research on economic impact, community engagement, and scalability

Future research directions include:

* Economic analysis of the long-term benefits of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Community-based studies on social impacts and acceptance of nature-based solutions
* Development of policy frameworks to support large-scale adoption

## Actions/Recommendations List

1. **Develop national policies** integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
2. **Establish training programs** for farmers and policymakers.
3. **Conduct further research** on economic impact, community engagement, and scalability.

## Closing Outlook

The Mekong Basin faces significant landslide risks exacerbated by climate change. By adopting nature-based solutions like agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we can protect livelihoods and ensure sustainable development.
