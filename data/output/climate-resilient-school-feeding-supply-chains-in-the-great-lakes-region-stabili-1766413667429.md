# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Great Lakes Region: Enhancing Food Security During Droughts

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, particularly in lower-income countries where droughts and water scarcity are increasingly common. The Great Lakes region is no exception, with its agricultural sector heavily reliant on rainfall and water resources. This brief explores the potential of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for efficient irrigation and clean energy production.

## Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Great Lakes Region

Climate change is projected to increase drought frequency and severity in the region, affecting agricultural productivity and food security (1). Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns will alter crop yields, water availability, and soil health. It is essential to develop climate-resilient agricultural practices that prioritize efficient water use, soil conservation, and biodiversity preservation.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

The Great Lakes region relies heavily on traditional irrigation methods, including boreholes and canals (2). However, these systems often suffer from high water loss due to evaporation and seepage. Moreover, the reliance on diesel generators for energy consumption contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while enhancing water retention and reducing erosion (3). By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can promote ecosystem services, increase crop yields, and adapt to changing climate conditions.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency and Clean Energy

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for efficient irrigation and clean energy production. These small-scale hydroelectric systems harness the power of water flow to generate electricity, reducing reliance on diesel generators and lowering greenhouse gas emissions (4). By integrating micro-hydro with agroforestry practices, farmers can create climate-resilient supply chains that prioritize efficiency, sustainability, and economic stability.

## Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects in the Great Lakes region have demonstrated the feasibility of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for efficient irrigation and clean energy production (5). These integrated approaches can enhance food security, promote economic stability, and support sustainable development. Economic analysis highlights the cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up these innovative solutions.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Develop policy frameworks** to support adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains.
2.  **Invest in capacity building** for farmers, extension services, and local governments to promote agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies.
3.  **Establish partnerships** between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities to facilitate technology transfer and scaling up.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains offer a promising solution for stabilizing food security during droughts in the Great Lakes region. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for efficient irrigation and clean energy production, we can enhance economic stability, promote sustainable development, and support climate resilience.
