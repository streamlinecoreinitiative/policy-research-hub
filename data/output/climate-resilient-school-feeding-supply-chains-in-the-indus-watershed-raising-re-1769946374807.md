**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Indus Watershed: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to integrate renewable energy solutions into school feeding supply chains in lower-income countries, particularly in the Indus watershed. By doing so, we can enhance water security and bolster climate adaptation efforts. Our primary recommendation is for governments, NGOs, and development practitioners to invest in solar-powered water pumps and rainwater harvesting systems to ensure equitable access to clean drinking water.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. This region also lags behind globally in electricity access, with 53.3% of the population lacking reliable power [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. The low consumption of renewable energy (19.7%) underscores the need for a transition towards cleaner energy sources [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020].

## Analysis

### Water Security:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024].
* The global average is 73.7%, highlighting the region's significant gap in water security [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024].

### Electricity Access:

* 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacks access to electricity, hindering development opportunities [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023].
* Globally, 91.6% of the population has access to electricity, emphasizing the region's lag in this area [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023].

### Renewable Energy Consumption:

* Sub-Saharan Africa consumes only 19.7% renewable energy, underscoring the need for a transition towards cleaner energy sources [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020].
* The global population lacking safe water is estimated to be 2.2 billion people [Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure:** Governments should prioritize projects like solar-powered water pumps and rainwater harvesting systems to enhance access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration:** Encourage the use of solar panels for electricity generation, particularly in remote areas where grid connectivity is inadequate.
3. **Climate Resilience Programs:** Implement climate-smart irrigation techniques and early-warning systems to protect against droughts and floods.

## Implementation Considerations

* Funding: Establish dedicated funds or partnerships to finance these projects.
* Community Engagement: Involving local communities ensures sustainable use of resources and encourages participation in maintenance efforts.
* Policy Frameworks: Develop supportive policies that incentivize renewable energy adoption and water infrastructure development.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and climate resilience is crucial for the prosperity and sustainability of Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing these recommendations, governments can make significant strides toward ensuring equitable access to clean water and reliable power, fostering a resilient future.
