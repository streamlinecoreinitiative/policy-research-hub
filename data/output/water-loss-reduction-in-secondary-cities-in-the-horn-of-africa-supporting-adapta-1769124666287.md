# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Horn of Africa: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

To address the critical challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $1 billion over the next 5 years to enhance rural water supply systems. This investment will improve access to safe drinking water for an additional [VERIFY] million people, reduce water loss by [NEEDS SOURCE]% , and promote rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling technologies. By prioritizing these interventions, governments can bolster water security, enhance clean energy access via renewables, and fortify climate adaptation strategies.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe environmental challenges. Despite significant strides globally, the region lags behind in accessing safely managed drinking water (32.4% of the population) [1] and electricity access (53.3%) [2]. Climate change further compounds existing challenges, with rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns affecting water availability and energy production.

### Analysis

Current data reveals substantial disparities in access to clean water and electricity across Sub-Saharan Africa. The challenge is particularly pronounced in rural areas where infrastructure development lags behind urban centers. For instance, while 73.7% of the global population has access to safely managed drinking water [3], only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans can access such resources [1]. Similarly, electricity access stands at 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to 91.6% globally [2].

Renewable energy consumption in the region is even more limited, with only 19.7% of final energy consumption coming from renewable sources [4]. This disparity highlights a critical need for increased investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects to meet growing demand while reducing carbon emissions.

Climate adaptation measures are also underdeveloped. The region is highly vulnerable to climate impacts such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. Without robust adaptation strategies, these vulnerabilities could intensify over time, further straining already strained resources.

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following policy interventions:

1. **Enhance Water Infrastructure:**
	* Invest in rural water supply systems to improve access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1].
	* Promote rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling technologies to augment existing water resources (UN-Water/WHO, 2022) [5].
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Access:**
	* Increase subsidies for solar energy systems in off-grid areas (World Bank, 2024) [6].
	* Encourage community-led renewable energy projects to promote decentralized power generation and reduce transmission losses.
3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Strategies:**
	* Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters using existing weather forecasting data (NOAA) [7].
	* Implement crop diversification programs that incorporate drought-resistant varieties of crops in agriculture (UN-Water/WHO, 2022) [5].

### Implementation Considerations

To ensure successful implementation, we recommend:

1. **Funding Mechanisms:**
	* Leverage international development funds and bilateral aid to support water infrastructure projects (World Bank, 2024) [1].
	* Encourage private sector investment through innovative financing mechanisms like impact bonds.
2. **Capacity Building:**
	* Provide training programs for local communities on maintenance and operation of renewable energy systems.
	* Strengthen institutional capacities at national and subnational levels to manage these initiatives effectively.

### Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires immediate and concerted action. By prioritizing investments in rural water supply systems, promoting renewable energy access, and strengthening climate adaptation strategies, governments can create a more resilient future for the region's populations.

**Next Steps:**

* Develop pilot projects to test key recommendations.
* Establish monitoring and evaluation frameworks to track progress and adjust strategies as needed.
* Advocate at national and international levels for increased investment in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation initiatives.
