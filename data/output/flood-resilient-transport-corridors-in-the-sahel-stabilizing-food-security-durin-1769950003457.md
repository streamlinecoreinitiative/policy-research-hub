**Bridging Water Security Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa through Renewable Energy and Climate Resilience**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the pressing need to address water security gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa, where [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). Coupled with limited electricity access at [VERIFY] 53.3%, these issues threaten sustainable development goals and exacerbate climate change impacts. To bridge this gap, we recommend integrating renewable energy solutions like solar-powered desalination plants and rainwater harvesting into national infrastructure plans.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity due to inadequate access to safe drinking water [VERIFY] 32.4% (World Bank Open Data) and electricity [VERIFY] 53.3% (World Bank Open Data). These issues are exacerbated by climate variability, leading to frequent droughts and floods. According to the World Bank, renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa reached [NEEDS SOURCE] of total final energy consumption in 2021.

## Analysis

Data from the World Bank indicates that [VERIFY] 2.2 billion people worldwide lack safe drinking water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for a significant proportion of this figure at [VERIFY] 32.4% (World Bank Open Data). Access to electricity stands at only [VERIFY] 53.3%, underscoring the critical need for innovative solutions (World Bank Open Data).

Solar-powered desalination plants can provide a scalable solution by converting seawater into fresh water using solar energy. According to World Bank data, renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa reached [NEEDS SOURCE] of total final energy consumption.

## Policy Recommendations

* **Integrate Renewable Energy Solutions**: Incorporate solar-powered desalination plants into national water security plans by 2025, with a focus on rural areas where access to safe drinking water is most limited.
* **Promote Rainwater Harvesting**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems in urban and rural areas to reduce demand for traditional water sources by [NEEDS SOURCE] within the next three years.
* **Support Community Projects**: Fund community-led projects that utilize renewable energy technologies for water management, with a focus on empowering local communities to take ownership of their water security.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investment costs can be substantial but are offset by long-term savings on water treatment and energy bills. Long-term maintenance and operation costs should also be factored in. Political resistance, lack of awareness, and insufficient funding may hinder implementation. Stakeholder engagement and capacity-building programs can address these challenges.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security gaps through renewable energy solutions is crucial for Sub-Saharan Africa's sustainable development. By integrating solar-powered desalination plants and rainwater harvesting into national infrastructure plans, governments can enhance resilience against climate change impacts. We urge governments to prioritize the integration of renewable energy technologies in their water security strategies to ensure long-term sustainability and equitable access to freshwater resources.

**Call to Action**: Governments should commit to investing [NEEDS SOURCE] of their annual budget towards integrating renewable energy solutions for water management by 2025, with a focus on rural areas where access to safe drinking water is most limited.
