# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Sahel: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing the expansion of clean water access through cost-effective technologies and public-private partnerships (PPPs). Specifically, governments and development partners should invest in implementing UV treatment or solar stills where feasible, increasing PPPs for sustainable well construction and maintenance. This targeted approach can help bridge the significant gaps in safely managed drinking water access, which currently stands at 32.4% [1] in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to a global average of 73.7% [2].

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. Despite recent progress in reducing population without safe water (down from 3.4 billion people in 2000 to 2.2 billion people in 2022 [3]), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water [1]. Electricity access stands at 53.3%, a significant gap given the region's economic needs for development [4]. Achieving SDG 6 on safely managed water requires further improvements, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

### Analysis

Recent data from the World Bank shows that Sub-Saharan Africa has 91.6% electricity access but only 53.3%, indicating a substantial gap in energy access [5]. The renewable energy consumption percentage in this region is just 14.2%, far below global averages (19.7%) [6]. These disparities underscore the critical need for accelerated investments in clean water and renewables to support climate resilience, particularly given the rising frequency of extreme weather events.

### Policy Recommendations

To bridge these gaps, we recommend:

1. **Expand Access to Clean Water:** Implement cost-effective water purification technologies like UV treatment or solar stills where feasible. Increase public-private partnerships (PPPs) for sustainable well construction and maintenance.
2. **Boost Renewable Energy Adoption:** Encourage decentralized renewable energy solutions such as mini-grids, especially in rural areas. Promote PPP models that leverage existing infrastructure to deploy renewable energy projects quickly.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation:** Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters. Support community-based adaptation initiatives focused on water management and food security.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require substantial investments, particularly in the initial setup phases. Public funding from international development agencies can play a crucial role. Cost estimates suggest that expanding clean water access could cost [VERIFY] annually over five years, while renewable energy projects might range between $Y and Z million per project [8]. Addressing potential barriers such as regulatory hurdles or resistance to change will require clear communication strategies and stakeholder engagement.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa’s triple challenge of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience demands urgent action. By adopting evidence-based policy interventions and fostering collaborative implementation efforts, the region can accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 6, ensuring more resilient communities in a changing climate.
