**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Andean highlands face significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity and energy poverty. Peri-urban households rely heavily on traditional cooking methods that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation and clean cooking solutions.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Andean Highlands**

The Mesoamerican region is characterized by a fragile water balance, exacerbated by climate change impacts, population growth, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Current irrigation systems are often inefficient, leading to high operational costs and environmental degradation. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can provide an integrated solution for sustainable water management.

* **Key Challenges:**
	+ Limited access to electricity for micro-hydro systems
	+ Inefficient use of water resources in traditional irrigation methods
	+ High operational costs associated with existing infrastructure

**Section 2: Current Practices and Challenges**

Peri-urban households in the Andean highlands rely on traditional cooking methods, including wood-burning stoves and charcoal. These practices contribute to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and water scarcity.

* **Current Cooking Methods:**
	+ Wood-burning stoves
	+ Charcoal use

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Agroforestry practices can enhance soil fertility, improve water retention, and promote biodiversity. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

* **Benefits of Agroforestry:**
	+ Enhanced soil fertility
	+ Improved water retention
	+ Promoting biodiversity

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency and Clean Cooking**

Micro-hydro technology can provide a reliable source of renewable energy, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and lowering emissions.

* **Advantages of Micro-Hydro Technology:**
	+ Low capital costs
	+ High reliability
	+ Potential for integration with agroforestry practices

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct further research on the potential synergies between agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop policy recommendations to support the adoption of clean cooking solutions in peri-urban households.
3. Establish partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector stakeholders to implement integrated water management and clean energy projects.

**Closing Outlook**

The transition to clean cooking methods and climate-resilient irrigation practices is crucial for addressing environmental challenges in the Andean highlands. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with sustainable agriculture practices, we can reduce emissions from critical sectors while promoting economic benefits and enhancing water security.
