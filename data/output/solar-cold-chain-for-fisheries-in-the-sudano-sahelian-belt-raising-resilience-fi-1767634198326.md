# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: raising resilience finance for communities

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Enhancing Resilience through Renewable Energy**

### Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt faces significant water scarcity and climate change impacts on agriculture and fisheries. This brief proposes an innovative approach to enhance environmental resilience by integrating solar-powered cold-chain systems with micro-hydro technology for fisheries in the region.

### Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

#### Introduction

Climate change has severe impacts on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns lead to reduced water availability and exacerbated water scarcity issues.

#### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation practices in the Sudano-Sahelian belt rely on boreholes and canals for water delivery. However, these systems are plagued by inefficiencies:

* [Verify] 30% loss of water due to poor canal design (evaporation and seepage)
* High labor costs for constructing and maintaining irrigation systems
* High fuel costs for diesel generators

#### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry plays a crucial role in enhancing climate resilience by:

* Improving soil health through increased moisture retention
* Enhancing biodiversity, leading to natural pest control and pollination services

#### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency and Energy Savings

Micro-hydro systems offer a renewable energy source for irrigation systems, reducing reliance on diesel generators:

* Renewable energy source for irrigation systems (e.g., reduced diesel generator usage)
* Examples of successful micro-hydro projects showing improved water delivery

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems enhances both water security and renewable energy use:

* Pilot projects demonstrating increased crop yields
* Reduced dependency on external energy sources due to self-sufficient renewable energy supply (Project 1, Project 2)

### Policy Recommendations: Subsidies, Grants, Infrastructure Development

To raise resilience finance for communities, the following policy recommendations are proposed:

* Government subsidies for initial investments in micro-hydro system installations
* Community-led micro-hydro system installations with local government support

### Future Research Directions: Long-term Sustainability Assessments and Community Engagement

Long-term sustainability assessments (5-year monitoring period) will ensure the benefits from integrated systems are maintained. Community engagement strategies, including participatory decision-making processes, will be essential for successful implementation.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1. Conduct a thorough needs assessment to identify areas with high potential for solar cold-chain adoption.
2. Develop and implement a subsidy program for initial investments in micro-hydro system installations.
3. Support community-led micro-hydro system installations through local government partnerships.
4. Establish long-term sustainability assessments (5-year monitoring period) to ensure benefits from integrated systems.

### Closing Outlook

The proposed project offers a comprehensive approach to enhancing environmental resilience in lower-income countries, particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By integrating solar-powered cold-chain systems with micro-hydro technology, communities can improve fish quality and increase income from fisheries.
