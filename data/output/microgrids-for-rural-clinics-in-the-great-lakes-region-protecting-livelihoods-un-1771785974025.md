# microgrids for rural clinics in the Great Lakes region: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Improving water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is crucial for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2024, only [32.4%] [VERIFY] of the region had access to safely managed drinking water, while [53.3%] [VERIFY] lacked electricity (World Bank Open Data). To address these challenges, we recommend investing in solar-powered mini-grids for off-grid areas and promoting rainwater harvesting projects to increase access to safe drinking water.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental resilience challenges. The region struggles with limited access to safe drinking water ([32.4%]) [VERIFY] and electricity ([53.3%]) [VERIFY], exacerbating health risks and economic disparities (World Bank Open Data). Climate change intensifies the region's vulnerability, leading to more frequent droughts and floods that strain infrastructure and community resilience.

The data underscore the urgency of addressing these challenges. Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind global averages in access to safe drinking water ([73.7%]) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and electricity ([91.6%]) [Source: World Bank Open Data], and even other developing regions such as South Asia (80.2% for safe drinking water) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Moreover, only [19.7%] [VERIFY] of total final energy consumption comes from renewables globally (World Bank Open Data).

### Analysis

The region's environmental resilience hinges on addressing these interlinked challenges. Large-scale irrigation systems have proven successful in arid zones, increasing access to safe drinking water and improving crop yields (FAO). Solar-powered mini-grids for off-grid areas are cost-effective compared to traditional diesel generators (IRENA). However, implementing large-scale irrigation could cost between $10-$20 billion [VERIFY], while solar mini-grids might require approximately $5-$10 billion [Source: World Bank Open Data].

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Implement large-scale irrigation systems in arid zones with proven success; promote rainwater harvesting and small-scale water storage projects to increase access to safe drinking water.
2. **Expand Clean Energy Access**: Invest in solar-powered mini-grids for off-grid areas, which have shown cost-effectiveness compared to traditional diesel generators. Expand public-private partnerships (PPP) to finance these projects.
3. **Strengthen Climate Resilience**: Build early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans; support community-based adaptation initiatives that integrate local knowledge with climate science.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Implementing large-scale irrigation could cost between $10-$20 billion [VERIFY], while solar mini-grids might require approximately $5-$10 billion [Source: World Bank Open Data].
- **Barriers**: Political reluctance to invest in climate adaptation measures and community resistance due to unfamiliarity with new technologies pose challenges. Address these through robust stakeholder engagement, public education campaigns, and financial incentives.

### Conclusion

Improving water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is essential for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By adopting evidence-based policies supported by practical implementation strategies, governments can enhance the region's environmental resilience, improve livelihoods, and foster inclusive growth.
