# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Pacific SIDS: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in Pacific SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant challenges in ensuring food security, economic development, and climate resilience. The fisheries sector is a critical component of these economies but is vulnerable to climate-related stressors such as sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and changes in fish populations. This brief highlights the importance of solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries in Pacific SIDS, which can support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By promoting sustainable fishing practices, improving food safety, and enhancing climate resilience, these systems can contribute to the long-term sustainability of fisheries and community well-being.

**I. Introduction**

The Pacific SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate change due to their geographic location, limited resources, and dependence on natural resources. The fisheries sector is a significant contributor to the economies of many Pacific SIDS but faces numerous challenges related to climate change. Rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and changes in fish populations threaten the long-term sustainability of fisheries, which can have far-reaching impacts on food security, economic development, and community well-being.

**II. Climate Change Impacts on Fisheries**

*   **Sea-level rise:** Coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources threaten fishing communities and their livelihoods.
*   **Ocean acidification:** Changes in ocean chemistry affect the availability of fish for human consumption and commercial fisheries.
*   **Changes in fish populations:** Shifts in fish distributions and abundance due to climate change impact fishing practices and community food security.

**III. Solar Cold-Chain Systems for Fisheries**

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improved food safety through reduced post-harvest losses
    *   Enhanced climate resilience by reducing dependence on diesel-powered refrigeration
    *   Promoting sustainable fishing practices through better management of fish catches
*   **Implementation:** Collaboration between governments, private sector companies, and local communities is essential for the successful implementation of solar cold-chain systems.

**IV. Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

*   **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs):** Pacific SIDS have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change impacts.
*   **Solar cold-chain systems:** Can contribute to achieving adaptation targets by promoting sustainable fishing practices, improving food safety, and enhancing climate resilience.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop a regional strategy for the implementation of solar cold-chain systems in Pacific SIDS.**
2.  **Establish public-private partnerships to support project development and implementation.**
3.  **Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for local communities and fishing industry stakeholders.**
4.  **Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of solar cold-chain systems in achieving adaptation targets and improving food security, economic development, and climate resilience.**

**Closing Outlook**

The Pacific SIDS face significant challenges related to climate change but also have opportunities to lead in developing innovative solutions that promote sustainable fishing practices, improve food safety, and enhance climate resilience. Solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries can contribute to achieving adaptation targets outlined in NDCs and support the long-term sustainability of fisheries and communities in Pacific SIDS. By working together, we can ensure a more resilient and sustainable future for these critical ecosystems.
