**Climate Resilient Water Supply Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Energy Access and Renewable Integration**

## Executive Summary

Develop climate-resilient water supply systems that integrate renewable energy solutions to enhance energy access and ensure sustainable water security for millions of vulnerable populations in Sub-Saharan Africa. This policy brief highlights the urgent need for such interventions, given the region's low percentage of population with access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), exacerbating climate vulnerabilities.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity, which are critical for health outcomes, economic productivity, and social stability. Climate change has led to increased variability in rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, and extreme weather events, threatening existing water infrastructure and exacerbating existing inequalities. The lack of safe drinking water and reliable electricity impacts health outcomes, with 2.2 billion people globally lacking access to safely managed drinking water (UN-Water/WHO).

## Analysis

The data paints a stark picture:

- **Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024)**: [VERIFY] 32.4 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
- **Access to electricity (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2023)**: [VERIFY] 53.3 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
- **Renewable energy consumption (%) - World (2020)**: 19.7 [Source: World Bank Open Data]

Despite global progress in safely managed water coverage (74% globally, UN SDG Report 2023), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind. The region's reliance on non-renewable energy sources further exacerbates its vulnerability to climate change.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Develop Climate-Resilient Water Supply Systems**:
   - Invest in infrastructure that can withstand climate impacts such as droughts and floods.
   - Implement water harvesting technologies like rainwater collection systems to ensure continuous supply during dry periods.
   - Promote decentralized solar-powered water pumps for remote areas where grid electricity is unreliable.

2. **Integrate Renewable Energy Solutions**:
   - Utilize small-scale renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind) to provide power for water treatment facilities and pumping stations.
   - Encourage community-led initiatives that can manage and maintain these systems sustainably.
   - Provide training programs for local communities on renewable energy technologies.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Initial investments in climate-resilient infrastructure could be substantial but are likely justified by long-term benefits, including reduced health risks from contaminated water and improved socioeconomic outcomes due to enhanced energy access.
- **Potential Barriers**: Political resistance, lack of technical expertise, initial capital costs, and community buy-in may hinder implementation. Addressing these barriers through targeted training programs, public-private partnerships, and community engagement can facilitate smoother transitions.

## Conclusion

The imperative for climate-resilient water supply systems in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot be overstated. By integrating renewable energy solutions, we can enhance both water security and energy access, contributing to sustainable development goals while bolstering resilience against future climatic shocks. Governments, international organizations, and local communities must work together to implement these recommendations, ensuring a more resilient future for the millions affected by climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa.
