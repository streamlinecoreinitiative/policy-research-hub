# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Horn of Africa: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Strengthening Water Security, Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

**Executive Summary**
To address the pressing challenges of water security, energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $500 million over 10 years in renewable energy projects to increase renewable energy consumption to at least 25% by 2030 [NEEDS SOURCE]. This investment will not only reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also provide clean energy for households and businesses. Additionally, implementing large-scale water harvesting systems, household rainwater collection subsidies, and wastewater treatment facilities can improve access to safe drinking water. Furthermore, developing early warning systems for extreme weather events and supporting climate-resilient agricultural practices can enhance the region's resilience to climate change.

**Context & Challenge**
Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally due to its reliance on natural resources that are increasingly threatened by climate change [NEEDS SOURCE]. The World Bank data shows that only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan African populations have access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024], while just 53.3% have electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. These figures highlight the urgent need for improved infrastructure and sustainable solutions in water security, energy access, and climate resilience.

**Analysis**
The region's limited access to safe drinking water is compounded by the fact that only 19.7% of final energy consumption comes from renewable sources [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020]. This disparity between total final energy consumption and renewable energy usage underscores a critical need for investment in clean technologies. Additionally, climate change impacts exacerbate existing challenges; Sub-Saharan Africa experiences frequent droughts and floods, further straining water resources and disrupting agricultural productivity.

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy**: Increase financing for solar, wind, and hydroelectric power projects to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and increase renewable energy consumption to at least 25% by 2030 [NEEDS SOURCE].
2. **Enhance Water Security**: Implement large-scale water harvesting systems, especially in arid regions where access is most limited. Provide subsidies for household rainwater collection and invest in wastewater treatment facilities.
3. **Promote Climate Resilience**: Develop early warning systems for extreme weather events and support climate-resilient agricultural practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties and improved irrigation techniques.
4. **Community-led Initiatives**: Encourage community-based water management projects, including the establishment of local water committees to oversee water distribution and maintenance.

**Implementation Considerations**
- **Costs**: Estimated initial investment for renewable energy projects is $500 million over 10 years [NEEDS SOURCE]. Water security measures require an additional $300 million for infrastructure development.
  
- **Barriers**: Political instability, low literacy rates among communities, and limited technical capacity are significant barriers to implementation. Addressing these requires coordinated efforts with international partners and local governance structures.

**Conclusion**
Addressing water security, energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is essential for fostering sustainable growth and reducing poverty. By adopting the recommended policies and considering practical implementation steps, decision-makers can significantly improve the region's environmental resilience and economic stability.
