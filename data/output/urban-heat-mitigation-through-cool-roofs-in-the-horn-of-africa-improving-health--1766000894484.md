# urban heat mitigation through cool roofs in the Horn of Africa: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Harnessing Agroforestry and Biochar Systems for Dual-Water Security and Climate Resilience in the Horn of Africa**

**Executive Summary:**
The Horn of Africa is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, exacerbating food insecurity and economic hardship. This brief highlights the potential of agroforestry systems to enhance soil health, drought resilience, and climate adaptation. Despite their promise, adoption remains limited due to a lack of reliable data on impact at scale. To address this gap, we recommend harnessing agroforestry and biochar systems for dual-water security and climate resilience.

**Section 1: Introduction to Drought in the Arid Sudan-Sahel Region**

The Horn of Africa is characterized by severe water scarcity, with climate change projections indicating a 20-30% decrease in rainfall by 2050 [1]. This has devastating consequences for food production and livelihoods. Water security is critical for agricultural productivity, as it accounts for approximately 70% of global freshwater withdrawals [2]. In the Arid Sudan-Sahel region, irrigation methods such as boreholes and dams are often inefficient and unsustainable [3].

**Section 2: Current Limitations in Water Security**

Existing irrigation methods in the region face significant challenges:

* **Inefficient use of water resources**: Boreholes and dams often rely on non-renewable groundwater sources, exacerbating depletion and salinization.
* **Micro-insurance schemes' limitations**: While these programs provide some protection against drought risks, their effectiveness is often hindered by inadequate coverage, high premiums, and limited access to insurance services [4].

**Section 3: Agroforestry Systems: A Promising Solution**

Agroforestry systems integrate trees with crops and livestock, offering a range of benefits:

* **Improved soil fertility**: Tree roots enhance soil structure, increase organic matter, and promote nutrient cycling.
* **Reduced erosion**: Tree cover reduces runoff, preventing soil loss and maintaining soil health.
* **Climate resilience**: Agroforestry systems can adapt to changing climate conditions by promoting biodiversity and ecosystem services [5].

Case studies from the region demonstrate successful implementation and benefits:

* **Kenya's Green Belt Movement**: Community-led agroforestry initiatives have improved livelihoods, increased food security, and enhanced environmental stewardship.
* **Ethiopia's Agroforestry Program**: Government-supported initiatives have promoted tree planting, improving soil health and reducing erosion.

**Section 4: Key Data Points Needed**

To inform policy and investment decisions, the following data points are essential:

* **Impact assessment**: Longitudinal studies on crop yields and productivity under different agroforestry setups.
* **Cost-benefit analysis**: Comparative analysis of agroforestry systems versus traditional irrigation methods over long-term periods.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Support research and development initiatives**: Fund longitudinal studies to assess the impact of agroforestry systems on crop yields, productivity, and climate resilience.
2.  **Promote policy and regulatory frameworks**: Encourage governments to adopt policies supporting agroforestry adoption, such as tax incentives, subsidies, or streamlined permitting processes.
3.  **Develop capacity-building programs**: Train farmers, extension agents, and policymakers on agroforestry practices, benefits, and implementation strategies.

**Closing Outlook:**
Harnessing agroforestry and biochar systems can provide dual-water security and climate resilience in the Horn of Africa. By addressing data gaps through research and development initiatives, promoting policy and regulatory frameworks, and developing capacity-building programs, we can unlock the potential of these systems to improve livelihoods, enhance food security, and mitigate climate change impacts.
