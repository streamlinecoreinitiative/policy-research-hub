# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Enhancing Water Security, Promoting Renewable Energy, and Strengthening Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity and limited access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives that integrate clean energy solutions. This approach can improve health outcomes during heatwaves by providing safe drinking water and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Specifically, we propose:

* Investing in desalination plants and rainwater harvesting systems to increase access to safely managed drinking water
* Encouraging the deployment of solar-powered wells and other clean energy solutions for rural areas
* Developing early warning systems and last-mile alerts to mitigate climate impacts such as droughts and floods

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing significant challenges in safe water supply and electricity access. According to World Bank data (2024), only 73.7% of the world population has access to safely managed drinking water, while just [VERIFY] % of Sub-Saharan Africa's population enjoys this level of service [1]. Similarly, despite a global rate of 91.6%, access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa is limited at 53.3% [2].

## Analysis

The lack of safe drinking water directly impacts public health and economic productivity. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this issue affects over 2 billion people globally (UN-Water/WHO, 2022) [3]. Additionally, the region's limited electricity access hinders industrial growth and exacerbates climate vulnerabilities. For instance, renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7% of total final energy consumption worldwide (World Bank, 2020), with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind even these global averages [4].

## Policy Recommendations

To address the critical needs in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation, consider the following actionable steps:

1. **Improving Water Supply**: Invest in infrastructure projects such as desalination plants and rainwater harvesting systems to increase access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promoting Renewable Energy**: Encourage the deployment of solar-powered wells and other clean energy solutions for rural areas, reducing dependency on fossil fuels.
3. **Enhancing Climate Resilience**: Develop early warning systems and last-mile alerts to mitigate climate impacts such as droughts and floods.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning and coordination across various sectors:

* **Funding Mechanisms**: Establish dedicated funds or partnerships between government, NGOs, and private sector entities to finance infrastructure projects.
* **Community Engagement**: Engage local communities in decision-making processes related to water supply and energy access. Ensure equitable distribution of benefits by involving women and marginalized groups.

## Conclusion

By prioritizing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation, Sub-Saharan Africa can pave the way for sustainable development. Stakeholders must collaborate to implement evidence-based solutions that address immediate needs while laying foundations for long-term resilience. Immediate action is crucial to achieve these goals within existing political and institutional constraints.
