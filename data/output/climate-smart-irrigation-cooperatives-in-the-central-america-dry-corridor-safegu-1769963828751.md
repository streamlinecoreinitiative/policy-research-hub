# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Central America dry corridor: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Central America Dry Corridor: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a triple challenge of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. With only 32.4% of the region's population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), coupled with a renewable energy consumption rate of just 19.7%, this area urgently needs targeted interventions to build resilience. We recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Central America dry corridor as a critical step towards enhancing water security, promoting clean energy access, and adapting to climate change.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's population is heavily dependent on natural resources, making it highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Water scarcity exacerbates existing challenges like droughts and floods (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), while limited access to electricity and clean cooking fuels poses significant health risks and economic burdens.

- **Water Access**: Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage of population with access to safely managed drinking water in the world (World Bank, 2024) at 32.4% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. This disparity is particularly pronounced among rural areas.
- **Renewable Energy**: The region lags behind globally in renewable energy consumption, standing at just 19.7% of total final energy consumption (World Bank, 2024). Sub-Saharan Africa faces high costs and limited infrastructure for transitioning to cleaner energy sources.

## Analysis

The interplay between water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability is profound, contributing to malnutrition, disease outbreaks, and economic stagnation. For instance, the lack of access to safe drinking water leads to over 400 million people contracting diarrheal diseases annually (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, 2023), while inadequate clean cooking fuels contribute to respiratory illnesses and deforestation.

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa's reliance on rain-fed agriculture is highly susceptible to climate variability. Droughts impact crop yields significantly, leading to food insecurity (FAO, 2024).
- **Energy Access**: The region suffers from high energy poverty rates, with only [VERIFY]53.3% of the population having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). This disparity exacerbates health risks and hinders economic development.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, targeted interventions are essential:

1.  **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Develop community-led irrigation systems that incorporate climate-resilient practices, such as rainwater harvesting and efficient water use.
2.  **Promote Clean Cooking Fuels**: Integrate affordable and efficient clean cookstoves to reduce indoor air pollution and deforestation.
3.  **Expand Renewable Energy Access**: Focus on decentralized solar power systems for off-grid areas.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require a coordinated effort involving multiple stakeholders:

- **Funding**: Allocate dedicated budgets for water security projects and renewable energy initiatives. Explore public-private partnerships to leverage additional funding sources.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local communities in maintenance and operation of new infrastructure. Establish community-led organizations to manage water points and solar systems.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, promoting clean energy access, and strengthening climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa is critical for sustainable development. By prioritizing targeted interventions and fostering collaborative efforts among stakeholders, the region can build a more resilient future.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and international organizations must prioritize investments in these areas to ensure equitable and sustainable development outcomes. Collaboration across sectors will be key to achieving widespread impact.

## Next Steps

Conduct pilot projects to test feasibility and gather evidence for scaling up successful interventions. Establish regional networks of experts and practitioners to share best practices and learn from each other's experiences.
