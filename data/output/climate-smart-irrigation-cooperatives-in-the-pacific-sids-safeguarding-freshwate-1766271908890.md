**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in Pacific Small Island Developing States: Enhancing Water Security and Climate Resilience**

**Executive Summary**

This brief highlights the importance of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to ensure water security, promote clean energy adoption, and enhance climate adaptation. The focus is on safeguarding freshwater ecosystems, which are critical for island communities' livelihoods.

**Introduction**

The Pacific SIDS face significant water scarcity due to their geographical location and climate characteristics. Traditional irrigation methods often rely on diesel generators, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs for smallholder farmers. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use.

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives: A Solution**

1. **Water Security**
	* Water scarcity is a critical issue in the Pacific SIDS, affecting food security and economic stability.
	* Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives can help reduce water loss through efficient irrigation methods and promote water harvesting techniques.
2. **Clean Energy Adoption**
	* Micro-hydro systems offer an opportunity for small-scale renewable energy generation, reducing reliance on diesel generators and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.
3. **Climate Adaptation**
	* Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives can help farmers adapt to changing weather patterns by promoting water conservation and efficient use of rainfall.

**Implementation Strategies**

To implement climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS:

1. **Capacity Building**: Provide training and capacity-building programs for smallholder farmers on agroforestry, micro-hydro systems, and climate-resilient irrigation practices.
2. **Infrastructure Development**: Support the development of micro-hydro systems and water harvesting infrastructure to enhance water security and efficiency.
3. **Policy Support**: Encourage policy reforms that promote renewable energy adoption, water conservation, and climate resilience in agriculture.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop a regional framework** for implementing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS.
2. **Provide technical assistance** to smallholder farmers on agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
3. **Support policy reforms** that promote renewable energy adoption, water conservation, and climate resilience in agriculture.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution for addressing water scarcity, promoting clean energy adoption, and enhancing climate adaptation in the Pacific SIDS. By safeguarding freshwater ecosystems, these initiatives can contribute to sustainable development goals and improve island communities' livelihoods.
