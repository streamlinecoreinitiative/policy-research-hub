# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, facing water scarcity and heatwaves exacerbated by climate change. This brief explores agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a climate-resilient solution for irrigation, energy efficiency, and community well-being.

## Water Security in Lower-Income Countries

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

The region's climate is characterized by erratic rainfall patterns, droughts, and heatwaves. These events have severe impacts on agriculture, food security, and economic stability.

*   Climate change projections indicate a decrease in annual rainfall, but specific percentages are not available.
*   Heatwaves are becoming more frequent, with temperatures rising above 45°C (113°F) for several days at a time.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems suffer from high water loss through evaporation and seepage. This inefficiency leads to:

*   Water scarcity: Reduced crop yields and decreased agricultural productivity.
*   Economic instability: Losses for farmers and communities due to reduced income.

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into farming practices, agroforestry can:

*   Enhance water retention: Reducing runoff and increasing groundwater recharge.
*   Improve crop yields: Increased resilience to droughts and heatwaves.

## Clean Energy in Lower-Income Countries

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a viable solution for irrigation efficiency, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency. Benefits include:

*   Renewable energy source: Harnessing the power of water to generate electricity.
*   Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: Decreasing dependence on fossil fuels.

## Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects demonstrate the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, showcasing:

*   Improved water security: Enhanced irrigation efficiency and reduced water loss.
*   Increased energy access: Renewable energy for communities and farmers.

## Policy Recommendations

To support adoption at scale, policy recommendations include:

*   Subsidies for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects
*   Low-interest loans for community-led initiatives
*   Infrastructure development for integrated systems

## Future Research Directions

Additional studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems. Key areas include:

*   Long-term sustainability assessments: Evaluating the resilience of these systems over time.
*   Community engagement strategies: Understanding the social benefits and challenges associated with these solutions.

### Needed Evidence

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a thorough analysis of climate data for the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
2.  Develop an economic model to assess the financial viability of agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3.  Engage with local communities to understand their needs and concerns regarding these integrated solutions.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries. By addressing the challenges associated with water scarcity and heatwaves, we can improve health outcomes and enhance community well-being. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of these integrated solutions and ensure their long-term sustainability.

This brief provides a comprehensive overview of the potential for agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in secondary cities of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By addressing water scarcity, promoting clean energy, and enhancing climate resilience, we can create more sustainable and equitable communities for all.
