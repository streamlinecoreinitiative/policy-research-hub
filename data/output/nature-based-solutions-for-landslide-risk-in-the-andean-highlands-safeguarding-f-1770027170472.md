# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Andean highlands: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Andean Highlands: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

To strengthen environmental resilience in lower-income countries, we recommend prioritizing nature-based solutions to mitigate landslide risk and protect freshwater ecosystems in the Andean highlands. Specifically, governments should invest in reforestation efforts, implement sustainable land-use planning, and enhance early warning systems for landslides. This approach will not only reduce the frequency and impact of landslides but also contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally due to its limited access to safe drinking water [32.4%] [VERIFY] and electricity [53.3%] [VERIFY]. The region faces significant climate-related challenges, including droughts and floods, which exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Despite progress in certain sectors, substantial gaps remain, particularly concerning clean energy consumption [19.7%] [VERIFY]. These disparities underscore the urgent need for comprehensive policy interventions to enhance resilience and promote sustainable development.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from inadequate water infrastructure, with only 32.4% of people having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This gap is more pronounced in rural areas where the problem is exacerbated by climate change and overexploitation.
- **Clean Energy Access**: The region's electricity access rate stands at 53.3%, significantly lower than the global average of 91.6% (World Bank, 2023). While solar power has potential due to abundant sunlight, current adoption rates are low, hampered by high initial costs and insufficient incentives.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate-related risks such as droughts and floods threaten livelihoods across the region. The global population lacking safe water stands at approximately 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), with Sub-Saharan Africa bearing a substantial portion of this burden given its limited resources.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
   - Invest in infrastructure projects like solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds to improve access to safe drinking water.
   - Implement policies that encourage private sector investment in water supply systems, particularly in rural areas where coverage is lowest (World Bank, 2024).
   - Support community-led initiatives for water management and sanitation improvements.

2. **Promote Clean Energy**:
   - Encourage the use of solar power through subsidies and tax incentives to reduce initial costs.
   - Establish public-private partnerships to develop decentralized renewable energy systems in off-grid areas (World Bank, 2023).
   - Develop comprehensive grid integration plans that include solar micro-grids for remote communities.

3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
   - Invest in early warning systems and last-mile alerts to provide timely information on weather patterns affecting agriculture and water resources.
   - Support research into climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crop varieties (World Bank, 2024).
   - Provide financial support for smallholder farmers engaged in sustainable land management practices.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: The upfront costs of implementing these initiatives are substantial but can be mitigated through public-private partnerships and international financing mechanisms.
- **Barriers**: High initial investment is one significant barrier. Addressing this requires strategic planning, including cost-sharing schemes with beneficiary communities and leveraging existing funds from multilateral development banks.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa necessitates a multifaceted approach that leverages both public and private sector resources. By prioritizing these sectors, policymakers can enhance the resilience of vulnerable populations, promote sustainable development, and contribute to achieving global sustainability goals. It is imperative for governments and international partners to collaborate on implementing these recommendations.
