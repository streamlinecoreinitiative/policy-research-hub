**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Indus Watershed: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

### Executive Summary

The Central African Rainforest faces severe water scarcity due to climate change, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from wetlands. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers in vulnerable communities. This project proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to address these issues by integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems.

### Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity

Climate change affects agriculture in the Central African Rainforest through erratic rainfall patterns leading to reduced water availability for crops and increased evaporation from wetlands exacerbating water scarcity issues. The impacts include:

* Erratic rainfall patterns resulting in reduced water availability for crops
* Increased evaporation from wetlands exacerbating water scarcity issues [verify]

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation systems, including boreholes and canals, have significant limitations:
* Water loss through evaporation and seepage: 30% loss due to poor canal design [verify]
* Economic costs associated with traditional irrigation methods:
	+ Manual labor in constructing and maintaining irrigation systems
	+ Diesel generator fuel costs

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry plays a crucial role in climate resilience through:

* Improved soil structure and water retention capacity due to vegetation cover
* Increased biodiversity providing natural pest control and pollination services, reducing the need for chemical inputs
* Economic benefits from cost savings on labor, fertilizers, and other inputs due to enhanced soil health

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide renewable energy and improve irrigation efficiency through:

* Explanation of micro-hydro technology and its benefits in providing renewable energy
* Comparison of cost savings from reduced reliance on diesel generators:
	+ Reduced fuel costs [verify]
* Examples of successful micro-hydro projects demonstrating improved irrigation efficiency

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems provides a comprehensive solution to address water scarcity issues:

* Improved water security demonstrated through increased crop yields
* Reduced dependency on external energy sources due to self-sufficient renewable energy supply
* Economic analysis showing the cost-effectiveness of these combined solutions [verify]

### Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems:

* Government subsidies, grants, or low-interest loans to support initial investment
* Funding for infrastructure improvements needed to facilitate implementation

### Future Research Directions

To ensure the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of these integrated systems:

* Long-term sustainability assessments through 5-year monitoring period for soil health, water retention, and community engagement
* Community engagement strategies through participatory decision-making processes (e.g., farmer-led irrigation committees)

### Actions/Recommendations List

1. **Integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems** to provide a sustainable solution addressing both water security and renewable energy use.
2. **Conduct economic analysis** to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of these combined solutions.
3. **Develop policy recommendations** to support adoption, including government subsidies, grants, or low-interest loans.
4. **Foster community engagement** through participatory decision-making processes.

### Closing Outlook

The proposed solution provides a comprehensive approach to addressing water scarcity issues in the Central African Rainforest. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, smallholder farmers can improve their resilience to climate change and reduce economic challenges.
