**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Food Security during Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, one of the most densely populated regions in South Asia, is facing severe water scarcity and food insecurity due to climate change-induced droughts. This brief highlights the potential of cool roofs as a cost-effective solution for urban heat mitigation and irrigation efficiency in this region.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity**

Climate change is impacting agriculture in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta by causing erratic rainfall patterns. The average annual rainfall in this region ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify]. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, consuming significant amounts of electricity.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices**

Traditional irrigation practices in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta are characterized by high energy consumption and water loss. Borehole pumps consume substantial amounts of electricity, while canal systems experience losses through evaporation and seepage.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, agroforestry can increase soil organic matter [verify] and biodiversity [verify]. Local surveys and case studies have demonstrated community acceptance and benefits derived from agroforestry practices.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation purposes. These systems can generate power ranging from 10-50 kW per system, with an energy efficiency of 70-80% [verify]. Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods make micro-hydro systems a viable option for communities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with cool roof technology can provide cost-effective solutions for urban heat mitigation and irrigation efficiency. Total project costs per hectare range from $10,000-$25,000 [verify]. Long-term sustainability assessments reveal that these integrated systems can enhance water security and food stability in the region.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Subsidies for Farmers**: Provide incentives to farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Grid Integration**: Integrate micro-hydro systems with the grid to enhance reliability and efficiency.
3. **Infrastructure Development**: Improve roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure to support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is facing unprecedented challenges due to climate change-induced droughts. By integrating cool roofs with agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, communities can reduce energy consumption, improve crop yields, and enhance water security. This brief highlights the potential of these integrated solutions and provides a framework for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to work together towards stabilizing food security in this region.
