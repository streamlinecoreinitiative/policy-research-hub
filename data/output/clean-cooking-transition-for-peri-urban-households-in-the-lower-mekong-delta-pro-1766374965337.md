**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Lower Mekong Delta: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

Executive Summary
-----------------

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and erratic rainfall patterns. Traditional cooking methods rely heavily on charcoal and wood, exacerbating deforestation, air pollution, and economic challenges for peri-urban households. This brief proposes an integrated approach to address these issues through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity**

The Lower Mekong delta is experiencing severe water scarcity due to climate change, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from wetlands. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers in vulnerable communities.

*   Climate change impacts on agriculture in the region include:
    *   Erratic rainfall patterns
    *   Increased evaporation from wetlands
    *   Soil degradation and reduced fertility
*   Resilient irrigation methods are crucial for food security and economic stability

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems, such as boreholes and canals, have significant limitations:

*   High energy consumption and costs
*   Water loss through evaporation and seepage
*   Limited water retention and reduced crop yields

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems offer numerous benefits for climate resilience:

*   Improved soil health and fertility
*   Enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services
*   Carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse gas emissions

Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry systems in improving water retention and reducing erosion.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology provides a sustainable solution for efficient irrigation:

*   Reduced reliance on diesel generators
*   Increased energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness
*   Potential for scaling up to larger communities

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, showcasing their potential for climate-resilient water supply.

**Section 5: Policy Recommendations**

To support adoption at scale:

1.  Develop policy frameworks for integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems
2.  Provide incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt these technologies
3.  Establish training programs for technicians and community leaders

Suggested areas for further research include economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

*   Develop a comprehensive policy framework for integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems
*   Provide incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt these technologies
*   Establish training programs for technicians and community leaders

Closing Outlook
-----------------

The Lower Mekong delta faces significant challenges due to climate change. An integrated approach combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for climate-resilient irrigation. By adopting this approach, peri-urban households can protect their livelihoods and contribute to the region's overall resilience.

This brief provides a comprehensive overview of the issues and potential solutions. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems and to inform policy decisions.
