# Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Central America Dry Corridor: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts and extreme weather events that affect millions of people. This brief emphasizes the importance of early-warning systems and last-mile alerts in reducing disaster losses for vulnerable groups.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity in the region, leading to crop failures, livestock deaths, and increased poverty. The agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable due to erratic rainfall patterns, increased evaporation from wetlands, and decreased water availability.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation methods are often energy-intensive and costly for smallholder farmers, exacerbating economic challenges. Existing systems include boreholes and canals but suffer significant water loss through evaporation and seepage.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it an essential component of climate-resilient agriculture. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry systems can enhance water retention and reduce erosion, improving crop yields and farmer livelihoods.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution to irrigation challenges by harnessing the power of small streams and rivers. This approach reduces reliance on diesel generators, increases energy efficiency, and provides a reliable source of clean water for agriculture.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have successfully integrated agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to provide climate-resilient irrigation. These initiatives demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up these solutions, improving food security and reducing poverty.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale:

1.  **Develop a national strategy** for integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro in irrigation systems.
2.  **Provide training and capacity-building programs** for farmers, technicians, and policymakers on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Establish a financing mechanism** to support the implementation of these projects.

## Closing Outlook

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change. By integrating early-warning systems with last-mile alerts and promoting agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we can reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups and improve food security. It is essential that policymakers, practitioners, and communities work together to scale up these solutions and support climate-resilient agriculture in the region.
