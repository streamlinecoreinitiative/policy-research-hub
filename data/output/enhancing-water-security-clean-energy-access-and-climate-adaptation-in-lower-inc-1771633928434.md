# Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and resilient infrastructure to withstand climate shocks. To address these pressing issues, we recommend accelerating renewable energy deployment, enhancing water infrastructure, and strengthening energy resilience. By investing in solar and wind projects, implementing water loss reduction programs, and developing microgrids, governments can make significant progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while fostering economic growth and improved living standards for their citizens.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries struggle with limited access to safe drinking water and electricity. According to World Bank data, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world in accessing safe drinking water [1] and electricity [2], highlighting stark disparities. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, leading to more frequent droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events that strain infrastructure and resources.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa's access to safe drinking water is alarmingly low (32.4%) compared to the world average (73.7%) [1]. This disparity highlights significant challenges in ensuring sustainable and equitable water resources [1].

### Clean Energy Access

Despite a global trend towards renewable energy, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 19.7% of total final energy consumption coming from renewables [3]. This underperformance is particularly concerning given the region's vulnerability to climate-induced power outages and increased demand for electricity.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Without robust infrastructure and energy resilience measures, these countries will struggle to maintain essential services and support economic growth.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Accelerate Renewable Energy Deployment**:
	* Invest in solar and wind projects to increase renewable energy consumption to at least 25% by 2030.
	* Encourage private sector investment through tax incentives, grants, and public-private partnerships (PPP).
2. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**:
	* Implement water loss reduction programs in secondary cities to improve access for an additional [VERIFY] million households.
	* Invest in rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants to augment water supply in arid regions.
3. **Strengthen Energy Resilience**:
	* Develop microgrids and off-grid solar energy solutions to ensure reliable electricity during grid failures.
	* Promote efficient cooking stoves using clean fuels like biogas to reduce indoor air pollution and increase access to cleaner energy sources.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Initial investments in renewable energy projects could range from $10 million to $20 million per project, with operating costs estimated at around $3-$5 million annually.
- **Barriers**: Political will is crucial for securing funding and implementing policies. Engaging stakeholders, including local communities and private sector partners, can help overcome resistance and promote sustainable practices.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to build more resilient societies. By adopting these recommendations, governments can make significant progress toward achieving the SDGs while fostering economic growth and improved living standards for their citizens.
