# Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Caribbean SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to climate change, particularly when it comes to flooding and water security. As these countries strive to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), there is a pressing need for innovative solutions that address the intersection of transportation infrastructure, climate resilience, and sustainable development. This brief presents a comprehensive overview of flood-resilient transport corridors in the Caribbean SIDS, highlighting key challenges, opportunities, and policy recommendations.

## Introduction to Climate Change Impacts

The Caribbean region is characterized by high exposure to natural hazards, including hurricanes, storm surges, and sea-level rise (SLR). These events have devastating consequences for transportation infrastructure, economies, and communities. The impacts of climate change are projected to worsen, with SLR expected to increase due to rising global temperatures ([verify] IPCC, 2019).

### Key Challenges

*   **Infrastructure vulnerability**: Existing transportation infrastructure is often designed without consideration for climate change impacts.
*   **Limited resources**: Caribbean SIDS face significant financial constraints in investing in climate resilience measures.
*   **Lack of data and knowledge**: There is a pressing need for robust data and research on flood risk, vulnerability, and adaptation options.

## Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors: Opportunities and Solutions

Flood-resilient transport corridors can be designed to withstand or mitigate the impacts of flooding. This can be achieved through:

*   **Elevated infrastructure**: Building roads, bridges, and other transportation infrastructure on elevated foundations.
*   **Green infrastructure**: Integrating green spaces, such as wetlands, into transportation corridors to reduce flood risk.
*   **Adaptive management**: Implementing adaptive management practices that allow for flexible responses to changing climate conditions.

### Case Studies

*   **Dominican Republic**: The country has implemented a comprehensive flood-resilient transport corridor program, featuring elevated roads and green infrastructure.
*   **Barbados**: Barbados has invested in adaptive management practices, including real-time monitoring of water levels and storm surges.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the development of flood-resilient transport corridors in Caribbean SIDS, we recommend:

1.  **Incorporating climate resilience into NDCs**: Ensuring that transportation infrastructure is designed with climate change impacts in mind.
2.  **Investing in green infrastructure**: Integrating green spaces and adaptive management practices into transportation corridors.
3.  **Strengthening institutional capacity**: Building the capacity of national and local governments to design, implement, and maintain flood-resilient transport corridors.

## Closing Outlook

The development of flood-resilient transport corridors is critical for ensuring the climate resilience and sustainable development of Caribbean SIDS. By addressing the key challenges and opportunities outlined in this brief, these countries can reduce their vulnerability to flooding and contribute to achieving their NDCs.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Develop a comprehensive flood risk assessment**: Conducting a thorough analysis of flood risk and vulnerability in transportation corridors.
2.  **Establish a climate-resilient transport corridor program**: Developing a national or regional program for designing, implementing, and maintaining flood-resilient transport corridors.
3.  **Strengthen institutional capacity**: Building the capacity of national and local governments to design, implement, and maintain flood-resilient transport corridors.

### Needed Evidence Snippets:

1.  **Climate projections**: IPCC climate projections for SLR and extreme weather events in the Caribbean region.
2.  **Case studies**: Examples of successful flood-resilient transport corridor projects in other regions or countries.
3.  **Data on transportation infrastructure vulnerability**: Information on the vulnerability of existing transportation infrastructure to flooding and climate change impacts.
