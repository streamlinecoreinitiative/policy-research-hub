# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces significant climate-related challenges, including rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. This brief highlights the need for climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the region, focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

**Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, with a significant portion of its population engaged in agriculture. Climate change has exacerbated existing water scarcity issues in the region, leading to reduced crop yields, decreased food security, and increased poverty levels.

*   **Erratic Rainfall Patterns:** The region experiences unpredictable rainfall patterns, resulting in both droughts and floods.
*   **Water Scarcity:** Existing irrigation systems are inefficient, with significant water loss through evaporation and seepage.
*   **Climate Change Impacts:** Rising temperatures and increased frequency of extreme weather events further exacerbate the situation.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to address water scarcity and climate-related challenges in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. Agroforestry practices promote soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, while micro-hydro systems provide efficient and renewable energy for irrigation.

*   **Agroforestry Benefits:**
    *   Improved soil health and fertility
    *   Enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services
    *   Carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation
*   **Micro-Hydro Systems:** Efficient and renewable energy source for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators and greenhouse gas emissions.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, policy recommendations include:

*   **Policy Support:** Governments should provide financial incentives, tax breaks, and other forms of support for farmers adopting climate-resilient irrigation practices.
*   **Capacity Building:** Training programs for farmers, extension workers, and policymakers are essential to build capacity and promote the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
*   **Research and Development:** Further research is needed to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of micro-hydro systems.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** to support the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation practices in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
2.  **Establish a training program** for farmers, extension workers, and policymakers to build capacity and promote the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Conduct further research** on the economic impact and community acceptance of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to address water scarcity and climate-related challenges in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By promoting climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, we can protect livelihoods, enhance food security, and contribute to sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption.
