# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Mekong basin: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Safeguarding Water Security, Ensuring Energy Access, and Building Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring water security, energy access, and climate resilience. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) [1] and just 53.3% accessing electricity (World Bank Open Data) [2], these issues pose substantial risks to economic development, health, and societal stability. To address this, we recommend implementing community-based water management systems, increasing renewable energy investments, and enhancing climate-resilient agricultural practices.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by arid to semi-arid climates with limited freshwater resources (World Bank Open Data) [1]. The region lacks sufficient infrastructure for clean water supply and electricity generation. Climate change intensifies these challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and floods that disrupt water supplies and increase energy demands.

According to the World Bank Open Data, Sub-Saharan Africa's water scarcity is exacerbated by unsustainable agricultural practices, over-reliance on groundwater, and inadequate sanitation facilities. The region's renewable energy landscape is also lagging behind, with only [VERIFY] 5.8% of final energy consumption coming from renewables in 2020 (World Bank Open Data) [2].

## Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's water scarcity issues are further complicated by:

* Unsustainable agricultural practices: Freshwater withdrawal accounts for [VERIFY] 9.2% of the world's freshwater resources (World Bank Open Data) [1], with a significant portion used for agriculture.
* Over-reliance on groundwater: Groundwater is often over-extracted, leading to decreased water tables and reduced access to clean drinking water.
* Inadequate sanitation facilities: Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) [1].

In contrast, renewable energy consumption in the world reached 19.7% in 2020 (World Bank Open Data) [2], with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind at 5.8%.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Implement community-based water management systems**: Develop and scale up community-managed water systems for irrigation, drinking water supply, and sanitation.
2. **Increase renewable energy investments**: Support policies to increase renewable energy investments in Sub-Saharan Africa by providing subsidies and incentives for solar and wind projects.
3. **Enhance climate-resilient agricultural practices**: Promote drought-resistant crop varieties, improved soil management techniques, and efficient water use technologies.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require:

* Practical steps: Implement community-led initiatives for water harvesting and distribution systems in rural areas.
* Costs: Estimate initial investment costs for infrastructure development at [VERIFY] $X million per year over five years (data unavailable).
* Potential barriers: Address social resistance, lack of technical expertise, and funding constraints.

## Conclusion

Urgent policy action is needed to accelerate water security, energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa through targeted investments and community engagement. By implementing community-based water management systems, increasing renewable energy investments, and enhancing climate-resilient agricultural practices, we can reduce the risks associated with water scarcity, energy access, and climate change.
