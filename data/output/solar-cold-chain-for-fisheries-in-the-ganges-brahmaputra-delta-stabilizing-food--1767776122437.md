**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Food Security during Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a densely populated and economically significant region in South Asia, where fisheries play a crucial role in the local economy. However, droughts have devastating impacts on food security and livelihoods. This brief explores the potential of solar cold-chain technologies to stabilize fish supply chains during droughts.

**Water Security in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

The delta faces challenges due to high population density, intensive agriculture, and limited water resources. Climate change exacerbates existing water scarcity issues, with droughts becoming more frequent (1). The lack of reliable water sources affects food security, livelihoods, and human well-being.

**Current Practices and Challenges**

Traditional cold-chain systems rely on diesel-powered generators or ice plants, which are often unreliable and expensive to operate. These systems contribute to greenhouse gas emissions (2). Inadequate infrastructure for cold storage and transportation hinders efficient supply chain management of fish products.

**Solar Cold-Chain Technologies**

Solar-powered refrigeration units can provide reliable cooling without fossil fuels, reducing operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions (3). These systems enable decentralization of cold storage and transportation infrastructure, improving supply chain efficiency.

**Integration with Climate Adaptation Strategies**

The integration of solar cold-chain technologies with climate adaptation strategies can enhance resilience:

• **Drought-tolerant fish species**: Promote the cultivation of drought-tolerant fish species that require less water.
• **Water-saving practices**: Implement rainwater harvesting and efficient irrigation systems to reduce water consumption in aquaculture.
• **Climate-resilient infrastructure**: Design climate-resilient cold storage facilities and transportation infrastructure.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current state of fish supply chains, including bottlenecks and areas for improvement [verify].
2.  Develop and implement solar-powered cold-chain technologies in collaboration with local stakeholders.
3.  Promote drought-tolerant fish species and water-saving practices among aquaculture farmers.
4.  Support climate-resilient infrastructure development.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of solar cold-chain technologies with climate adaptation strategies can help stabilize food security during droughts in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By promoting these solutions, we can build resilience to climate change and ensure continued access to fresh fish for local communities.
