# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With less than 40% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water and only [VERIFY]53% accessing electricity, we recommend implementing sustainable water supply solutions, increasing renewable energy use, and enhancing climate resilience through targeted policies.

**Key Recommendations:**

* Implement community water wells in rural areas where infrastructure is most lacking.
* Promote rainwater harvesting systems for domestic and agricultural purposes.
* Invest in solar-powered off-grid systems in remote areas.
* Offer tax incentives and subsidies for businesses investing in renewable energy projects.
* Develop climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant buildings and roads.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by limited infrastructure, high poverty rates, and frequent droughts and floods. The region's water security challenges are exacerbated by inadequate access to safe drinking water (32.4% [1]), while electricity access stands at 53.3% [2]. These disparities underscore the need for innovative solutions tailored to local contexts.

## Analysis

The global progress towards achieving universal access to safely managed drinking water is only [VERIFY]74% globally, leaving millions without essential services [3]. Sub-Saharan Africa's rate remains alarmingly low at 32.4%, highlighting a critical need for policy interventions [1]. The region's renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7%, far below the world average and essential targets set by the SDGs [4].

## Policy Recommendations

### Water Security:

1. **Introduce Community Water Wells**: Invest in community water wells that are accessible to all residents, with a focus on rural areas where infrastructure is most lacking.
2. **Promote Rainwater Harvesting**: Encourage the use of rainwater harvesting systems for domestic and agricultural purposes. Provide subsidies or grants to make these technologies more affordable.

### Clean Energy:

1. **Solar-Powered Off-Grid Systems**: Implement solar-powered off-grid systems in remote areas where grid connections are not viable, ensuring access to electricity through decentralized renewable energy sources.
2. **Renewable Energy Incentives**: Offer tax incentives and subsidies for businesses investing in renewable energy projects.

### Climate Adaptation:

1. **Nature-Based Solutions (NBS)**: Invest in NBS such as mangrove restoration, afforestation, and early warning systems to protect ecosystems and enhance resilience against climate impacts.
2. **Climate Resilient Infrastructure**: Develop infrastructure that is designed to withstand future climate events.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these policies would require substantial investment in technology, human capital, and community engagement. The World Bank and other international development partners can play a key role in funding these initiatives [5]. Potential barriers include resistance from existing stakeholders, lack of awareness among the general public, and technical challenges.

## Conclusion

The urgent need for robust policies on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is critical for sustainable development. By implementing these recommendations, governments can significantly improve the lives of millions while contributing to global environmental goals.
