# microgrids for rural clinics in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Boosting Sub-Saharan Africa's Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience: A Comprehensive Policy Agenda**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience through targeted policies. Our analysis shows that only 32.4% of the region’s population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), while renewable energy consumption remains below global averages at [VERIFY]%. To address these challenges, we recommend investing in microgrids for rural clinics in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, as a model that can be replicated in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally due to its high dependence on natural resources like water and electricity. Water scarcity affects [VERIFY]% of sub-Saharan Africans without access to reliable sources (World Bank Open Data, 2023), leading to health issues and economic losses. Similarly, only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023), hindering development opportunities. Climate change exacerbates these challenges with frequent droughts and floods damaging infrastructure and livelihoods.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa’s water scarcity affects millions, particularly women and children who bear the burden of collecting water daily (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). Access to safe drinking water is critical for health and education.
- **Clean Energy Access**: Despite recent advancements, only 53.3% of sub-Saharan Africans have access to electricity. Renewable energy consumption stands at just [VERIFY]%, far below global averages (World Bank Open Data, 2021).
- **Climate Adaptation**: The region’s climate resilience is weak due to frequent droughts and floods, leading to loss of lives and livelihoods. Climate change projections indicate increased vulnerability in the coming years.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, policymakers should:

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in water point construction and rehabilitation projects (World Bank, 2024) to improve access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Development**: Encourage investments in solar, wind, and hydro power generation. Provide incentives for renewable energy adoption (World Bank, 2023).
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Measures**: Implement early warning systems and climate adaptation projects like drought-resistant crops and flood mitigation infrastructure.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Estimated costs range from $5 billion to [VERIFY] billion over five years, primarily for water point construction and renewable energy development.
- **Barriers**: High upfront costs, lack of funding mechanisms, and technical expertise are key barriers. Collaboration with local communities and NGOs can help overcome these challenges.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa needs urgent policy interventions to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. By adopting the recommended policies, governments can significantly improve living standards while fostering sustainable development for future generations. Investing in microgrids for rural clinics in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a cost-effective solution that can be replicated across Sub-Saharan Africa.
