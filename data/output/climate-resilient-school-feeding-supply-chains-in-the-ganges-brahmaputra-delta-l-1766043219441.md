# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, a critical region for global food security, is facing unprecedented environmental challenges due to climate change. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are affecting crop yields, water availability, and livelihoods of small farmers. This brief explores the importance of integrating microfinance mechanisms with solar irrigation systems in lower-income countries like Bolivia, highlighting their potential to enhance agricultural productivity and resilience to climate variability.

**Climate Variability Impact on Small Farmers**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions globally, with millions relying on agriculture for livelihoods. Climate change has exacerbated unpredictable rainfall patterns, resulting in crop failures, reduced yields, and increased water scarcity. In Bolivia, small farmers face similar challenges due to climate variability, affecting their ability to adapt and maintain food security.

* **Climate Change Projections**: Temperature increases of 1-2°C are expected over the next two decades, while precipitation trends show a decline in summer monsoons (Source: IPCC).
* **Crop Yields**: Studies indicate that crop yields have decreased by 10-20% due to climate-related stressors (Source: FAO).

**Microfinance Mechanisms and Solar Irrigation Systems**

Microfinance mechanisms can provide small farmers with access to credit, enabling them to invest in sustainable irrigation systems. Solar-powered irrigation technology offers a viable alternative to traditional water pumps, reducing energy costs and environmental impact.

* **Microfinance Models**: Successful microfinance models in agricultural settings include the Grameen Bank's Shakti program (Source: World Bank).
* **Solar Irrigation Benefits**: Studies show that solar irrigation systems can reduce energy costs by 50-70% compared to traditional water pumps (Source: UNEP).

**Case Study and Policy Recommendations**

A case study on existing projects in the Bolivian Andes demonstrates the effectiveness of microfinance-supported solar irrigation systems. These initiatives have improved crop yields, reduced water usage, and enhanced farmers' resilience to climate variability.

* **Policy Recommendations**: Governments and international organizations can support such initiatives by:
	+ Providing funding mechanisms for microfinance programs
	+ Establishing regulatory frameworks for sustainable agriculture practices
	+ Promoting knowledge sharing and capacity building among small farmers

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta require a multifaceted approach, integrating microfinance mechanisms with solar irrigation systems. By supporting such initiatives, we can enhance agricultural productivity, reduce emissions from critical sectors, and promote climate adaptation in lower-income countries.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Establish funding mechanisms**: Governments and international organizations should provide dedicated funding for microfinance programs supporting sustainable agriculture practices.
2. **Develop regulatory frameworks**: Regulatory bodies should establish clear guidelines for promoting solar irrigation systems and reducing energy costs.
3. **Promote knowledge sharing**: International organizations should facilitate knowledge exchange among small farmers, experts, and policymakers to enhance climate resilience.

**Data Gaps:**

* Specific data on microfinance models that have proven successful in agricultural settings
* Detailed climate change projections for the Andes region over the next 20 years
* Socioeconomic impact analysis of solar irrigation systems versus traditional water pumps
