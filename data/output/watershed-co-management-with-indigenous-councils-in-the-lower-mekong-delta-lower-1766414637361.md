# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Lower Mekong Delta: A Strategy for Reducing Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns threatening food security and economic stability for millions. This brief explores the potential of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a strategy to reduce emissions from critical sectors in the region.

## Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Delta

The Lower Mekong delta is a critical agricultural hub, primarily producing rice. Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, resulting in severe water scarcity. Rising temperatures have increased evaporation rates, exacerbating the issue. The region's existing irrigation systems are often inefficient and prone to water loss through seepage.

## Section 2: Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion. Integrating micro-hydro systems can generate clean energy and reduce reliance on diesel generators. This approach improves water retention and increases energy efficiency.

## Section 3: Policy Recommendations for Scaling Up

To support the adoption of watershed co-management with indigenous councils at scale, we recommend:

*   **Subsidies**: Governments should provide subsidies to communities implementing integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
*   **Low-interest loans**: Financial institutions should offer low-interest loans to communities to invest in these systems.
*   **Infrastructure development**: Governments should prioritize infrastructure development to support the expansion of micro-hydro systems.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  Conduct socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated solutions.
2.  Develop a cost-benefit analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3.  Establish partnerships between governments, NGOs, and local communities to support the scaling up of watershed co-management with indigenous councils.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils offers a promising solution to address water scarcity and climate change in the Lower Mekong delta. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, communities can improve their resilience while promoting sustainable livelihoods.
