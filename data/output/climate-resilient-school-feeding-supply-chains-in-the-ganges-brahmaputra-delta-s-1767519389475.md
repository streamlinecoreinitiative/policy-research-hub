# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent floods and droughts affecting agricultural productivity. This brief outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance environmental resilience through integrated agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in lower-income countries.

**Climate Change Impacts and Current Irrigation Practices**

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity issues in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, affecting agricultural productivity. Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from wetlands are reducing water availability for crops. Traditional irrigation methods, such as boreholes and canals, are energy-intensive and costly.

*   **Climate Change Impacts:**
    *   Climate change is affecting agriculture in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
        *   Erratic rainfall patterns leading to reduced water availability for crops.
        *   Increased evaporation from wetlands exacerbating water scarcity issues.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices can enhance soil health, improve water retention capacity, and promote biodiversity. Successful agroforestry projects demonstrate improved water retention and reduced erosion:

*   **Soil Health Benefits:**
    *   Improved soil structure and water retention capacity due to vegetation cover.
    *   Examples of successful agroforestry projects demonstrating improved water retention and reduced erosion.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide renewable energy while improving irrigation efficiency. Successful micro-hydro projects demonstrate improved irrigation efficiency:

*   **Overview of Micro-Hydro Technology:**
    *   Explanation of micro-hydro systems and their benefits in providing renewable energy.
    *   Comparison of cost savings from reduced reliance on diesel generators.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation:

*   **Integrated Systems Implementation:**
    *   Description of pilot projects where agroforestry and micro-hydro systems are integrated.
        *   Improved water security demonstrated through increased crop yields.

**Policy Recommendations**

To support the adoption of these integrated solutions, policy recommendations include:

*   **Subsidies and Grants:**
    *   Suggest government subsidies, grants, or low-interest loans to support adoption:
        *   Subsidy on initial investment for micro-hydro system installation.
*   **Infrastructure Development:**
    *   Propose funding for infrastructure improvements needed to facilitate the implementation of these solutions.

**Future Research Directions**

Long-term sustainability assessments and community engagement strategies are essential for ensuring the success of these integrated systems:

*   **Long-term Sustainability Assessments:**
    *   Suggest studies on long-term impacts to ensure the sustainability of these integrated systems.
*   **Community Engagement Strategies:**
    *   Methods for engaging local communities in planning, implementation, and monitoring phases of these projects.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  Conduct a comprehensive climate data analysis to inform the design and implementation of integrated agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  Develop and implement policy frameworks that support the adoption of these integrated solutions, including subsidies, grants, or low-interest loans.
3.  Establish community-led irrigation committees to ensure participatory decision-making processes.
4.  Conduct long-term sustainability assessments to monitor the effectiveness of these integrated systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed initiative has the potential to significantly enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries by addressing water scarcity and promoting renewable energy use. By supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs, this project contributes to global efforts in mitigating climate change impacts.
