# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sahel: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sahel: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief argues that climate-smart irrigation cooperatives are a crucial strategy for protecting livelihoods in the Sahel region, where water scarcity and climate change pose significant challenges. We recommend establishing at least [VERIFY] new irrigation cooperatives across the Sahel within the next five years, with a focus on small-scale farmers and rural communities. This will require an investment of $1 billion in infrastructure development, training, and technical assistance.

## Context & Challenge

The Sahel region is facing unprecedented water scarcity due to climate change, population growth, and inefficient irrigation practices. According to World Bank data, the average annual rainfall in the Sahel has declined by [VERIFY] since the 1980s (World Bank Open Data). This has resulted in crop failures, reduced agricultural productivity, and increased poverty among rural communities.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Access to safely managed drinking water is crucial for health and livelihoods. In the Sahel region, only [NEEDS SOURCE] of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This highlights the need for targeted investments in infrastructure, particularly in rural areas where access tends to be more limited.
- **Clean Energy**: Access to electricity is a basic necessity but also critical for economic development and climate resilience. In the Sahel region, only [NEEDS SOURCE] of the population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data). This gap exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, such as in Niger where rural areas suffer from unreliable power supply.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts are becoming more pronounced, with increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters. For instance, a severe drought in 2012 affected millions of people in Mali, resulting in significant agricultural losses.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Support the establishment of at least [VERIFY] new irrigation cooperatives across the Sahel within the next five years, with a focus on small-scale farmers and rural communities.
2.  **Invest in Infrastructure Development**: Invest $[NEEDS SOURCE] billion in infrastructure development, including water harvesting systems, desalination plants, and improved distribution networks.
3.  **Promote Renewable Energy**: Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power through subsidies, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding Mechanisms**: Mobilize public and private sector resources through grants, loans, and innovative financing mechanisms such as green bonds.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local communities in sustainable water management and renewable energy technologies to ensure long-term effectiveness. Establishing community-based organizations for maintenance and operation can enhance these programs.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in the Sahel region is crucial for building a resilient future. By implementing evidence-based strategies supported by robust policy frameworks, we can achieve significant progress towards achieving SDG 6 (clean water) and other relevant targets. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, and local communities will be essential to realizing these goals.
