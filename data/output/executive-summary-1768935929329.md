**Climate Resilient Water Supply and Renewable Energy in Sub-Saharan Africa: Bridging the Gap**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable clean energy, exacerbating climate impacts such as droughts and floods. To address this critical issue, we recommend prioritizing investments in climate-resilient water supply systems and renewable energy projects to accelerate progress towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6. Specifically, governments and development partners should implement water harvesting and storage projects to mitigate seasonal fluctuations, modernize existing boreholes with stormwater management systems, and develop microgrids for off-grid communities using solar and wind energy sources.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water, resulting in poor health outcomes. According to the World Bank Open Data (2024), only 32.4% of the region's population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], compared to a global average of 73.7% [2]. Additionally, the region lags behind in accessing electricity, with just 53.3% of its population having reliable power [3]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges through increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, further complicating efforts towards sustainable development.

## Analysis

Despite significant progress globally (73.7% access to safely managed drinking water), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind due to climate variability, leading to frequent water shortages and contamination [1]. In contrast, the world has made strides towards renewable energy consumption (19.7%), but Sub-Saharan Africa remains underrepresented at just 53.3% of population access [4]. Economic constraints and infrastructure limitations hinder widespread adoption.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

* **Invest in Climate-Resilient Water Supply Systems**:
	+ Implement water harvesting and storage projects to mitigate seasonal fluctuations.
	+ Invest in modernizing existing boreholes with climate-resilient designs, including stormwater management systems.

* **Promote Renewable Energy Projects**:
	+ Develop microgrids for off-grid communities using solar and wind energy sources.
	+ Encourage community-based renewable energy projects to increase access and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.

## Implementation Considerations

To implement these recommendations, we suggest:

* **Financing**: Mobilize public-private partnerships through innovative financing mechanisms such as green bonds and carbon credits, especially in rural areas where costs may be higher.
* **Infrastructure Development**: Prioritize the construction of resilient water supply infrastructure that can withstand climate-induced disruptions. Utilize existing funding streams like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to support sustainable projects.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and renewable energy access is essential for building a more resilient Sub-Saharan Africa. By prioritizing these interventions, governments and development partners can significantly improve living conditions and foster sustainable growth. We urge policymakers to take immediate action to bridge the gap in climate-resilient water supply systems and renewable energy projects.
