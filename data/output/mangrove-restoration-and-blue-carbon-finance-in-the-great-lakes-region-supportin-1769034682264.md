**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issues of water scarcity, limited access to clean drinking water, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend implementing community-based watershed management projects. These initiatives should be integrated with modern technologies to enhance local water resources sustainability. Furthermore, scaling up renewable energy projects is crucial for ensuring sustainable energy access without grid expansion costs.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water and reliable energy sources. According to World Bank Open Data (2024), only 32.4% of the region's population has access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This is a critical concern, given the region's vulnerability to climate variability and unsustainable agricultural practices. The limited access to electricity exacerbates economic disparities and hinders sustainable development goals (SDG 7), including clean energy targets.

## Analysis

The World Bank data indicates that only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water, with an estimated [VERIFY] people lacking safe water globally [2]. While the region's renewable energy consumption is increasing (19.7%, World Bank Open Data, 2020), electricity access remains low at 53.3% of the population.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Community-Based Water Management**: Establish community-managed watershed projects to enhance local water resources sustainability. Integrate traditional knowledge with modern technologies for effective management.
2. **Renewable Energy Projects**: Scale up solar-powered well systems and rainwater harvesting ponds in rural areas, ensuring sustainable energy access without grid expansion costs.
3. **Early Warning Systems**: Implement early warning climate adaptation systems like flood alerts and drought monitoring networks to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing community-based projects requires initial investments for infrastructure setup. Scaling up renewable energy projects can be cost-effective through grants, subsidies, and public-private partnerships. Potential barriers include resistance from local communities to new technologies or regulations. Engaging stakeholders in decision-making processes can address these concerns.

## Conclusion

To ensure sustainable water security, reliable energy access, and climate resilience for Sub-Saharan Africa, it is crucial to adopt a comprehensive approach that leverages community-based solutions, renewable energy innovations, and robust early warning systems. Immediate action is needed to bridge the current gaps in access and enhance sustainability across the region.
