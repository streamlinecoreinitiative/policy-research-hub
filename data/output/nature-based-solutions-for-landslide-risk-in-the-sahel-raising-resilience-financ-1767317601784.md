# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sahel: raising resilience finance for communities

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sahel: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region is prone to landslides due to its fragile ecosystem, characterized by high rainfall variability and intense precipitation events. Climate change exacerbates this issue, making it essential to develop nature-based solutions that integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. This approach addresses water scarcity, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries like Ethiopia. The proposed project aims to raise resilience finance for communities by providing a cost-effective and sustainable solution to irrigation challenges.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity**

Climate change has significant impacts on the Ethiopian Highlands, characterized by:

* [Verify] Average annual rainfall of 800-1200 mm (source needed)
* Precipitation variability (annual range of 600-1400 mm) (source needed)
* Traditional irrigation systems experience water loss percentages:
	+ Evaporation: 30% (verify source)
	+ Seepage: 5% (verify source)

These losses highlight the need for more efficient and sustainable irrigation solutions.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods, such as borehole pumps and canal systems, are energy-intensive and economically burdensome:

* Cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods: [Verify] $100-$200/year (source needed)

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration:

* Soil organic matter: [Verify] 2-8% (source needed)
* Biodiversity increase: [Verify] 15-30% (source needed)
* Carbon sequestration: [Verify] 3-7 tons/ha/year (source needed)

Case studies from similar regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving climate resilience.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions:

* Power generation: [Verify] 10-50 kW per system (source needed)
* Energy efficiency: [Verify] 70-80% (source needed)
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrating these solutions offers cost-effective, sustainable outcomes:

* Total project cost: [Verify] $10,000-$25,000 per hectare (source needed)
* Return on investment (ROI): 3-5 years
* Long-term sustainability assessments

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Create supportive policy environments for sustainable solutions:

* Incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct local surveys and case studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop a cost-benefit analysis for the proposed solutions, including estimates of water savings, energy efficiency, and economic returns.
3. Collaborate with local governments and stakeholders to develop supportive policies and infrastructure for sustainable irrigation practices.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sahel region's vulnerability to landslides necessitates innovative, nature-based solutions that integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. By raising resilience finance for communities through cost-effective and sustainable irrigation practices, we can address water scarcity, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges in lower-income countries like Ethiopia.
