**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary
Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and electricity, exacerbated by climate change impacts. To bridge these gaps, we recommend prioritizing investments in clean energy solutions (e.g., solar and wind power projects), enhancing water security through climate-resilient infrastructure (e.g., rainwater harvesting and desalination plants), and promoting climate-resilient infrastructure development.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in access to safe drinking water ([VERIFY] 32.4%)[1] and electricity ([VERIFY] 53.3%) [2], with renewable energy consumption at only [VERIFY] 19.7% [3]. Climate change intensifies these challenges by increasing drought frequency, leading to water scarcity and power outages that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.

## Analysis
The region's lack of sufficient infrastructure for safe water supply is a critical issue, with [VERIFY] access to safely managed drinking water at only 32.4% [1]. This disparity is exacerbated by climate-induced changes in precipitation patterns. Despite overall increases, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions globally ([VERIFY] 53.3% vs 91.6%) [2] in electricity access. Renewable energy consumption remains low at [VERIFY] 19.7%, making it difficult to meet growing demand sustainably [3].

## Policy Recommendations
1. **Invest in Clean Energy Solutions**: Support the development of solar and wind power projects, leveraging existing World Bank data on renewable energy consumption ([VERIFY] 19.7%)[3].
2. **Enhance Water Security**: Implement climate-resilient water management systems such as rainwater harvesting and desalination plants, supported by UN-Water/WHO data on global population lacking safe water (2.2 billion people) [4].
3. **Promote Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Invest in flood-resistant buildings, resilient roads, and irrigation systems using World Bank data on electricity access (% of population) for Sub-Saharan Africa [2].

## Implementation Considerations
1. **Costs**: Initial investments are substantial but offset by long-term savings from reduced water scarcity and energy costs.
2. **Barriers**: Political resistance to new projects, lack of skilled labor, and funding constraints require targeted policy support.

## Conclusion
Accelerate the implementation of these recommendations to enhance resilience in lower-income countries, ensuring sustainable development amidst climate change challenges. By bridging the gaps in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, we can reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups and promote equitable development.
