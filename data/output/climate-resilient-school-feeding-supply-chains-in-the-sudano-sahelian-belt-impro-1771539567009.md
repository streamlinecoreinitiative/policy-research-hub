**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issue of environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in climate-resilient school feeding supply chains. This initiative aims to improve health outcomes during heatwaves by providing safe drinking water and clean energy for cooking meals in schools. By implementing this policy, governments and development partners can significantly reduce the burden on vulnerable populations.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing significant challenges in ensuring water security, accessing clean energy, and adapting to climate change. Recent data highlights the stark contrast between Sub-Saharan Africa's water access rates (32.4% vs 73.7%) and renewable energy consumption levels (19.7% vs 26.5%). According to the World Bank Open Data, only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. This disparity underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions that address both immediate needs and long-term sustainability.

## Analysis

Access to clean water is fundamental for health, education, and economic development. The region's poor access rate (32.4%) highlights significant challenges in meeting basic sanitation standards. For instance, a 2024 World Bank report shows that only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity, making existing vulnerabilities more pronounced. In terms of renewable energy consumption, while there is growth, it lags behind global trends. This analysis underscores the necessity for accelerated investment in infrastructure and policy reforms to bridge these gaps.

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance environmental resilience, government officials and development practitioners should prioritize:

1. **Expanding Safe Drinking Water Infrastructure**: Invest in new water wells and pipelines to increase access to safe drinking water. For instance, a 2024 World Bank report indicates that only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed water [Source: World Bank Open Data].
2. **Promoting Clean Cooking Solutions**: Implement subsidies or incentives for clean cooking stoves such as biogas and solar cookers, which reduce indoor air pollution and improve health outcomes.
3. **Investing in Climate-Smart Agriculture**: Develop climate-resilient agricultural practices that enhance food security and productivity while minimizing environmental impacts.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires:

- Allocating dedicated budget lines for water infrastructure projects.
- Collaborating with NGOs and international partners to leverage additional resources.
- Engaging communities through awareness campaigns to build buy-in and support. Potential barriers include limited funding, resistance from existing infrastructure, and technical challenges in implementation.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to meet basic needs and foster sustainable development. By implementing the recommended policies and addressing potential barriers proactively, decision-makers can significantly improve living standards and future resilience for millions of people in the region.
