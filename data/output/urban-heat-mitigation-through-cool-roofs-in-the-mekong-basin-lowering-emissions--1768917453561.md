# urban heat mitigation through cool roofs in the Mekong basin: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

We recommend prioritizing urban heat mitigation strategies, specifically cool roofs, to reduce emissions and enhance environmental resilience in the Mekong basin. This policy intervention aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 13 for climate action. By implementing cool roof technologies, decision-makers can create a more sustainable future for their populations.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, with only **32.4% of the population having access to safely managed water sources** [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. Coupled with global temperature rise of +1.1°C since pre-industrial times [Source: IPCC AR6 (2019)], climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves [Source: NOAA Climate (2025)].

## Analysis

The critical issue of safe drinking water access is further compounded by the fact that only **19.7% of the global population consumes renewable energy sources** [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)]. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this number drops to a mere **3%** [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], highlighting the urgent need for increased investment in clean energy infrastructure.

The consequences are stark: climate change has already led to more frequent and severe droughts [Source: NOAA Climate (2025)], affecting water availability and quality. Additionally, heatwaves have become increasingly common, particularly in urban areas where access to air conditioning is limited, exacerbating health risks for populations without adequate cooling options.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following policy interventions:

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Increase investment in water infrastructure such as wells and boreholes. Implement community-based management systems that ensure long-term sustainability [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)].
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Use**: Invest in solar-powered desalination plants and microgrids for rural clinics to provide reliable electricity during power outages [Source: Microgrid Global Alliance (2019)]. Encourage the use of renewable energy through subsidies and incentives.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Measures**: Develop early warning systems for droughts and heatwaves. Implement climate-resilient school feeding supply chains that ensure food security during periods of water scarcity [Source: Food Security Network (2023)].

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these policies will require significant financial resources. According to the UNFCCC, developing countries need an annual investment of **$5.8-5.9 trillion by 2030** in climate finance [Source: UNFCCC (2024)]. While this represents a substantial challenge, it is essential for ensuring long-term environmental and economic sustainability.

To mitigate costs, governments can explore innovative financing mechanisms such as green bonds or public-private partnerships. Additionally, leveraging international development assistance and donor funding will be crucial to supplement domestic resources [Source: OECD (2023)].

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize robust policies on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to address its urgent challenges. By expanding access to safe drinking water, promoting renewable energy use, and enhancing climate resilience through early warning systems and infrastructure improvements, decision-makers can create a more sustainable future for their populations.
