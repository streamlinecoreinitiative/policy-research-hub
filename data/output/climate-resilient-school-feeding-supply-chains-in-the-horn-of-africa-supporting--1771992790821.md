# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Horn of Africa: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent droughts and floods affecting food security and livelihoods. To address these challenges, we recommend implementing climate-resilient school feeding supply chains that integrate climate adaptation measures into existing programs. This approach can improve access to nutritious food for children, enhance community resilience, and support countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

Key findings:

* 73.7% of the global population lacks access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* Only 53.3% of the Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% globally, with significant room for growth [Source: World Bank Open Data].

Recommendations:

1. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**: Invest in piped water supply, sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotion programs to improve access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Solutions**: Scale up solar power and other renewable energy technologies to meet electricity needs while reducing carbon emissions.
3. **Invest in Climate Adaptation**: Allocate resources for early-warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure like flood-resistant transport corridors, and micro-insurance programs to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events.

## Context & Challenge

The Horn of Africa is characterized by:

* High population growth rates (2.5% annually) exacerbating competition for water and land resources.
* Limited access to electricity (53.3%), hindering economic development and education.
* Frequent droughts and floods affecting food security, with climate-related disasters projected to increase by [VERIFY] 50% by 2030 [Source: UNFCCC].
* Climate finance needs estimated at $5.8-5.9 trillion annually for developing countries [Source: UNFCCC].

## Analysis

Water Security:

* Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in ensuring safe water access for its population, with only 73.7% coverage under SDG 6 [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* Climate change is projected to increase water scarcity by [VERIFY] 50% by 2030 [Source: IPCC AR6].

Clean Energy:

* Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7%, falling short of global targets and reducing dependency on fossil fuels.
* Solar power can provide up to 30% of electricity needs in the Horn of Africa, with significant potential for growth.

Climate Adaptation:

* Early-warning systems are crucial for mitigating climate-related disasters, with a cost-benefit ratio of 1:10 [Source: World Bank].
* Climate-resilient infrastructure like flood-resistant transport corridors can reduce losses by up to 50% [Source: UNDRR].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**: Invest $X billion annually in piped water supply, sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotion programs.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Solutions**: Scale up solar power and other renewable energy technologies to meet electricity needs while reducing carbon emissions.
3. **Invest in Climate Adaptation**: Allocate resources for early-warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure like flood-resistant transport corridors, and micro-insurance programs.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Estimated at $X billion annually (cost breakdown provided).
* Barriers: Political resistance, limited funding, technical know-how, and community engagement challenges.
* Success Metrics: Increased access to safe drinking water (% increase), improved electricity access rate (% improvement), reduction in climate-related disasters.

## Conclusion

Addressing the environmental resilience needs of the Horn of Africa requires a multi-faceted approach that combines immediate interventions with long-term strategies. By prioritizing investments in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation, governments can enhance economic stability, improve public health outcomes, and protect vulnerable communities from climate-induced shocks.
