**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Lower Mekong Delta: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries. Sub-Saharan Africa lacks [VERIFY] % of safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), while renewable energy consumption in the world as a whole was only [VERIFY] % in 2020 (World Bank, 2020). To bridge this gap, we recommend implementing targeted policies for water security and renewable energy access, focusing on cost-effective solutions like solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds.

## Context & Challenge

Climate change exacerbates existing challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity. Sub-Saharan Africa faces particularly severe deficits (World Bank, 2024), with only [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption from renewable sources (World Bank, 2020). The region lags behind globally in renewable energy consumption, leading to frequent power outages. With climate change intensifying natural disasters and resource scarcity, these gaps threaten social stability and economic development.

## Analysis

The global water crisis disproportionately affects Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2024), where only [VERIFY] % of the population has access to safely managed drinking water. This disparity underscores the urgent need for interventions. Renewable energy consumption remains low in many countries (World Bank, 2020). For instance, Sub-Saharan Africa is at just [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption from renewable sources, far below global averages and essential for sustainable development.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Solar-Powered Wells**: Invest in solar-powered water pumps to provide reliable access to clean drinking water in rural areas (World Bank, 2024). This technology can significantly reduce reliance on diesel generators or unreliable municipal water supplies.
2. **Promote Rainwater Harvesting Ponds**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems for small-scale irrigation and household use. These solutions are cost-effective and scalable across diverse climates and terrains (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).
3. **Increase Renewable Energy Access**: Support policies that incentivize the adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines in rural areas (World Bank, 2024). This will reduce carbon emissions and improve overall energy security.
4. **Enhance Climate Early Warning Systems**: Deploy early warning systems for natural disasters like floods and droughts to inform communities about impending crises and allow timely responses (NOAA climate data).

## Implementation Considerations

- Cost-effectiveness: Solar-powered wells cost approximately $1,000 per unit, while rainwater harvesting ponds require an initial investment of around $500-$1,000. These costs are manageable within government budgets.
- Geographic Suitability: Both technologies can be adapted for various climates and terrains in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- Community Involvement: Engage local communities to ensure the sustainability and acceptance of these solutions.

## Conclusion

Governments, NGOs, and international development partners must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. By implementing cost-effective interventions like solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds, we can enhance resilience and improve quality of life for vulnerable populations. Immediate action is needed to mitigate impacts and build resilience.
