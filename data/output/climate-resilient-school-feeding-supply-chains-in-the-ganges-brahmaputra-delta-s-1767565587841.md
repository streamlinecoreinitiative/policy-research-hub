# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, home to over 200 million people, is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns threaten food security, water availability, and livelihoods. This brief focuses on addressing these challenges through climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in lower-income countries.

**Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta experiences high precipitation variability (annual range of 600-1400 mm), making water management a significant challenge. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive, with borehole pumps consuming [verify] kWh/day and canal systems losing [verify]% to evaporation and [verify]% to seepage.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

* Soil organic matter: 2-8% (source needed)
* Biodiversity increase: [verify]%
* Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

Case studies from similar regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving water retention, reducing erosion, and enhancing crop yields.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable energy solutions. Compared to traditional irrigation methods, micro-hydro systems offer significant cost savings, with a total project cost of $10,000-$25,000 per hectare (source needed).

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can create sustainable outcomes. Key benefits include:

* Reduced energy consumption
* Improved water retention
* Enhanced crop yields
* Increased community resilience

Cost estimates and financial viability analysis indicate a return on investment (ROI) of [verify] years.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, we recommend:

1. Incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans)
2. Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
3. Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research should focus on long-term sustainability assessments and local surveys to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop a National Action Plan**: Create a comprehensive plan to integrate climate-resilient school feeding supply chains into national development strategies.
2. **Establish Incentives for Farmers**: Offer subsidies, low-interest loans, and other incentives to encourage farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Invest in Infrastructure Development**: Develop roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure necessary to support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, water availability, and livelihoods in lower-income countries. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can create climate-resilient school feeding supply chains that enhance community resilience and improve irrigation efficiency.

**Key Data Points Needed**

1. **NOAA Climate Dataset**: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Local Surveys and Case Studies**: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Long-Term Sustainability Assessments**: Specific data on long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions.

**Needed Evidence Snippets**

* World Bank: electricity access (% of population, South Asia, latest)
* World Bank: renewable energy consumption (% of TFEC, world, latest)
