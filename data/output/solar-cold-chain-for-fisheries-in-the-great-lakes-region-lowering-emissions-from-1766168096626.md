# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Great Lakes region: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Great Lakes Region: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Pacific Islands are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including rising sea levels and increased storm intensity.

**Climate Change Vulnerability in Pacific Islands**

The region is among the most vulnerable to climate change. Rising sea levels threaten coastal ecosystems, while increased storm frequency poses significant economic risks. Rising temperatures exacerbate droughts, impacting agriculture and water availability.

* Climate change impacts:
	+ Sea level rise: [verify] mm/year (source needed)
	+ Increased storm frequency: [verify] increase by 2050 (source needed)
	+ Droughts: [verify] reduction in rainfall by 2100 (source needed)

**Agroforestry-Based Wind-Powered Desalination Systems**

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Integrating wind-powered desalination technology can provide a sustainable solution for water security.

* Benefits of agroforestry:
	+ Soil erosion reduction: [verify] (source needed)
	+ Biodiversity increase: [verify] (source needed)
	+ Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year (source needed)
* Wind-powered desalination technology:
	+ Small-scale wind turbines: 1-5 kW capacity
	+ Energy efficiency: [verify] % (source needed)

**Integration of Agroforestry and Wind-Powered Desalination in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential for combined agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems to provide a sustainable water supply.

* Pilot project examples:
	+ Fiji: [verify] reduction in energy costs (source needed)
	+ Samoa: [verify] increase in water retention (source needed)
* Economic analysis:
	+ Cost-effectiveness: $[verify] per liter (source needed)
	+ Potential for scaling up: [verify] increase in renewable energy adoption (source needed)

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems, policy recommendations include:

* **Actions/Recommendations**
	1. Develop and implement policies supporting the integration of agroforestry and wind-powered desalination in coastal communities.
	2. Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for local governments and communities.
	3. Establish a global knowledge-sharing platform to facilitate the exchange of best practices.

**Closing Outlook**

The Pacific Islands face significant climate-related challenges, including water security risks. Agroforestry-based wind-powered desalination systems offer a promising solution that can enhance both water availability and renewable energy use. Further research is needed to address data gaps and ensure the long-term viability of these integrated solutions.
