**Climate Resilient Water Security and Renewable Energy in Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Community Livelihoods**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights critical areas of concern for Sub-Saharan Africa, including water security, electricity access, and climate adaptation. To address these challenges, we recommend the implementation of three key policies:

1. **Enhance Water Security through Rainwater Harvesting and Community Wells**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems in rural areas, complemented by the construction or rehabilitation of community wells to ensure sustainable access to safe drinking water.
2. **Increase Access to Renewable Energy through Community Solar Projects**: Develop community-based solar energy projects that provide electricity access in rural areas, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and improving climate resilience.
3. **Promote Climate-Smart Agriculture Practices**: Support agroforestry value chains that integrate climate-resilient crops and practices, thereby improving both water security and agricultural productivity.

These interventions are critical to strengthening community livelihoods under climate stress and can be implemented within existing resources.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa continues to lag behind other regions in meeting basic needs such as safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%). Despite the global push towards renewable energy consumption reaching 19.7%, Sub-Saharan Africa still struggles with these critical issues, particularly for communities living in rural areas where access is often limited by infrastructure and economic constraints.

Climate change further compounds existing challenges, leading to more frequent droughts, floods, and extreme weather events that threaten livelihoods. According to the World Bank Open Data, Sub-Saharan Africa has 2.2 billion people lacking safe water [Source: UN-Water/WHO].

## Analysis

Recent data underscores the urgent need for intervention:

- **Safe Drinking Water**: Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind global averages (73.7% vs 32.4%), with only a third of its population having access to safe water [Source: World Bank Open Data].
- **Electricity Access**: While progress has been made, electricity remains largely inaccessible in rural areas, affecting economic productivity and health outcomes [Source: World Bank Open Data].
- **Renewable Energy Consumption**: Only 19.7% of Sub-Saharan Africa's total final energy consumption comes from renewable sources [Source: World Bank Open Data].

These gaps are exacerbated by climate change:

- **Droughts**: Frequent droughts threaten water supplies, particularly for communities already struggling with limited access to safe drinking water.
- **Floods and Extreme Weather**: Increased frequency of extreme weather events puts additional strain on existing infrastructure and exacerbates water-related issues.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security through Rainwater Harvesting and Community Wells**:
	* Implement rainwater harvesting systems in rural areas, complemented by the construction or rehabilitation of community wells to ensure sustainable access to safe drinking water.
	* Data Point: [VERIFY] Sub-Saharan Africa has 2.2 billion people lacking safe water (Source: UN-Water/WHO).
2. **Increase Access to Renewable Energy through Community Solar Projects**:
	* Develop community-based solar energy projects that provide electricity access in rural areas, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and improving climate resilience.
	* Data Point: Only 19.7% of Sub-Saharan Africa's total final energy consumption comes from renewable sources [Source: World Bank Open Data].
3. **Promote Climate-Smart Agriculture Practices**:
	* Support agroforestry value chains that integrate climate-resilient crops and practices, thereby improving both water security and agricultural productivity.
	* Data Point: 74% global coverage for safely managed drinking water by 2030 [Source: UN SDG Report 2023].

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Implementation of these projects would require significant investment, but the long-term benefits in terms of health outcomes and economic stability make it worthwhile.
- **Barriers**: Potential challenges include limited funding availability, resistance to change from communities accustomed to traditional practices, and technical expertise needed for project design and maintenance.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa needs targeted interventions focused on enhancing water security, increasing access to clean energy, and improving climate resilience. By implementing the recommended policies, decision-makers can lay a solid foundation for sustainable development that supports communities in coping with challenges posed by climate change and limited resources.
