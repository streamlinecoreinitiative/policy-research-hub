**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access & Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries**

### Executive Summary

Improving water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for lower-income countries to build resilience against future shocks. The current state of these sectors is alarming: Sub-Saharan Africa lags significantly behind the global average in access to safe drinking water (32.4% vs 73.7%) [1] and electricity (53.3% vs 91.6%) [2]. Renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7%, far below the target set by SDG 7 [3]. To address these challenges, we recommend implementing water security strategies, expanding clean energy access, and enhancing climate adaptation measures tailored to local contexts.

### Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries are disproportionately affected by water scarcity and energy poverty, exacerbated by climate change. Climate change impacts are severe in these regions with limited adaptive capacity [4]. Water scarcity leads to health issues and economic instability, while energy poverty hinders development and exacerbates environmental degradation. Sub-Saharan Africa faces particular challenges due to its geography, leading to both water scarcity (80% of the population lacks safe drinking water) **[VERIFY]** and energy access rates far below global averages.

### Analysis

#### Water Security

In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 32.4% have access to safely managed drinking water sources [5]. This figure is less than a third of the global average (73.7%) [6]. The consequences are severe: 2.2 billion people globally lack safe drinking water, and this number is projected to increase due to climate change [7].

#### Clean Energy Access

Just over half (53.3%) of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, compared to 91.6% globally [8]. Renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7%, far below the target set by SDG 7 [9].

#### Climate Adaptation

Despite significant renewable energy potential, only 19.7% of total final energy consumption comes from renewables **[VERIFY]**.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in infrastructure projects**: Implement desalination plants and rainwater harvesting systems to increase access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote microgrids and off-grid solar solutions**: Leverage local labor markets to build and maintain renewable energy systems for remote areas where grid expansion is impractical or cost-prohibitive.
3. **Develop insurance schemes**: Tailor insurance products to farmers and small businesses to mitigate financial losses from extreme weather events.

### Implementation Considerations

Estimated costs vary but are generally within the range of $10-$50 per capita annually for water security initiatives [10]. Clean energy access projects can cost between $20-$70 per household, depending on technology and scale. Potential barriers include limited funding, resistance to change from entrenched interests, and regulatory frameworks that do not support innovation in these sectors.

### Conclusion

Improving water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for lower-income countries to build resilience against future shocks. We urge governments to prioritize these interventions as part of broader national development plans. International partners can provide technical assistance, financial resources, and best practice examples. NGOs and civil society organizations play a crucial role by engaging communities directly and advocating for policy reforms that support sustainable solutions.
