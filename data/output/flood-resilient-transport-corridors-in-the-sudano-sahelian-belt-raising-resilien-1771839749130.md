**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing a triple challenge of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. To address these interlinked issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy, resilient infrastructure, and sustainable water management practices (World Bank, 2021). Specifically, governments should invest in solar, wind, and hydro power projects to reduce reliance on fossil fuels [VERIFY]. This will not only improve access to electricity but also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

## Context & Challenge

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most vulnerable regions in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to World Bank data (2024), 32.4% of the region's population has access to safely managed drinking water, significantly lower than global figures [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data). Climate change is exacerbating these vulnerabilities, with increased frequency of droughts and floods affecting freshwater resources and energy production.

## Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's reliance on non-renewable energy sources contributes to high greenhouse gas emissions (World Bank, 2024). Only 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity [VERIFY] (World Bank, 2023), limiting economic growth and quality of life. Rising temperatures are altering precipitation patterns, leading to water scarcity in some areas while causing excessive flooding in others.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy**: Governments should invest in solar, wind, and hydro power projects to reduce reliance on fossil fuels (World Bank, 2021). This will not only improve access to electricity but also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
2. **Implement Water Management Innovations**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems, groundwater recharge facilities, and small-scale irrigation schemes to improve water security.
3. **Develop Climate Resilient Infrastructure**: Develop flood defenses and drought-resistant crops, especially in arid regions.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial costs for renewable energy projects are relatively low compared to long-term savings on fuel imports [VERIFY] (World Bank, 2024). Limited financial resources and technical expertise pose challenges but can be addressed through international cooperation and capacity building programs. Governments should also explore public-private partnerships to finance these initiatives.

## Conclusion

Governments should prioritize investments in renewable energy, resilient infrastructure, and sustainable water management practices within their national development plans. This will not only build resilient societies but also contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We encourage governments to take immediate action by investing in flood-resilient transport corridors and promoting private sector investment in renewable energy projects.
