# ** Investing in Biodiverse Terraces for Climate-Resilient Agriculture in the Andean Region

**Investing in Biodiverse Terraces for Climate-Resilient Agriculture in the Andean Region**

**Executive Summary:**
The Andean region is characterized by its high biodiversity and steep terrain, making it highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as erratic rainfall patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Traditional agricultural practices often exacerbate these challenges, leading to soil degradation and reduced crop yields. Biodiverse terraces offer a solution to enhance resilience to climate change while improving overall water security and soil health. This brief highlights the benefits of biodiverse terraces, presents case studies from the region, and proposes policy recommendations for their integration and scaling-up.

**Climate Change in the Andean Region: An Overview**

The Andean region is home to a rich biodiversity, with over 40% of its territory designated as protected areas. However, this unique geography also makes it highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have led to increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and landslides (FAO, 2019). These events not only affect agricultural productivity but also exacerbate soil degradation, reducing the region's ability to adapt to future climate change projections.

**Current Agricultural Practices and Their Limitations**

Traditional farming methods in the Andean Region often prioritize high-yielding crop varieties over soil health and biodiversity conservation. This has led to widespread soil erosion, reduced fertility, and decreased water retention capacity (World Bank, 2018). The use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides further contributes to environmental degradation, contaminating water sources and harming local ecosystems.

**Biodiverse Terraces as a Solution**

Biodiverse terraces integrate multiple crops, including fruit trees, vegetables, and cover crops, into a single system. This approach enhances water retention, reduces soil erosion, and promotes biodiversity conservation (OAS, 2017). By mimicking natural ecosystems, biodiverse terraces can improve overall ecosystem services, including pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling.

* Key benefits:
	+ Improved water security through increased water retention
	+ Enhanced soil health through reduced erosion and improved fertility
	+ Increased crop diversity and resilience to pests and diseases

**Case Studies from the Andean Region**

Several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of biodiverse terraces in improving climate resilience and economic outcomes for farmers:

**Challenges and Solutions**

Potential obstacles to widespread adoption of biodiverse terraces include lack of knowledge, funding constraints, and limited access to markets. Proposed solutions include:

* Capacity building programs for farmers and extension services
* Financial incentives and subsidies for implementing biodiverse terrace systems
* Market-based approaches to promote the sale of biodiverse terrace products

**Policy Recommendations**

To support the integration and scaling-up of biodiverse terrace systems in the Andean Region, we recommend the following policy measures:

* National:
	+ Develop and implement policies promoting sustainable agriculture practices, including biodiverse terraces
	+ Allocate funding for capacity building programs and financial incentives
* Regional:
	+ Establish regional networks for knowledge sharing and best practice exchange
	+ Support market-based approaches to promote biodiverse terrace products

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the long-term economic impact on farmer livelihoods from adopting biodiverse terraces.
2. Develop detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional farming methods with biodiverse terrace systems in terms of both financial savings and environmental benefits.
3. Support case studies demonstrating the integration of biodiverse terraces into existing agricultural landscapes within the Andean Region.

**Closing Outlook:**
Investing in biodiverse terraces can provide a vital lifeline for farmers in the Andean Region, enhancing their resilience to climate change while improving overall water security and soil health. By addressing the challenges and limitations of traditional farming methods, we can promote more sustainable agriculture practices that benefit both people and the environment.
