**Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Horn of Africa: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Ethiopian Highlands are a critical region for agricultural production, but they face severe water scarcity due to climate change. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to enhance water security and reduce poverty among smallholder farmers.

**Section 1: Water Scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands**

The Ethiopian Highlands are a vital region for agricultural production, accounting for a significant portion of the country's crop yield (UN Environment Programme, 2020). Climate change has led to increased frequency and severity of droughts, resulting in water scarcity and reduced crop yields. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have exacerbated soil erosion, reducing fertility and affecting agricultural productivity.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Ethiopian Highlands rely heavily on boreholes and canals, which are prone to water loss through evaporation and seepage. Studies estimate that a significant amount of water is lost due to inefficiencies in these systems (Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture, 2018). This affects crop yields and increases energy consumption and costs for farmers.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies from the Ethiopian Highlands demonstrate that agroforestry systems can reduce erosion and increase water retention (World Bank, 2019). Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can improve irrigation efficiency while reducing reliance on diesel generators.

**Section 4: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. These integrated systems reduce water loss, increase energy efficiency, and provide a stable source of income for farmers (UN Environment Programme, 2020). Economic analysis suggests that these systems are cost-effective.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support policy reforms**: Encourage governments in the Horn of Africa to adopt policies supporting the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Invest in research and development**: Fund studies on the economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia.
3. **Promote capacity building**: Provide training and technical assistance for farmers, extension agents, and policymakers to ensure successful implementation of these integrated solutions.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to water scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands. By reducing water loss, increasing energy efficiency, and providing stable income for farmers, these systems can help stabilize food security during droughts.

Changes made:

- Removed the number "80%" as it was not verified.
- Changed "up to 50% of water is lost" to "a significant amount of water is lost" to avoid speculation.
- Removed the claim that agroforestry can reduce erosion by up to 70% and increase water retention by up to 30%, as these numbers were not provided in the original sources.
- Kept the length similar while preserving a formal, neutral tone.
