**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing investments in infrastructure projects that increase access to safe drinking water, promoting renewable energy use through incentives for solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants, and enhancing climate resilience by developing early warning systems and improving irrigation infrastructure. Specifically:

* Invest $[VERIFY] billion over the next 5 years in infrastructure projects like boreholes, pipelines, and rainwater harvesting systems to increase access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024).
* Implement feed-in tariffs or subsidies for renewable energy projects, targeting at least [NEEDS SOURCE] of the population with electricity access by 2030 (IRENA, 2023).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces critical challenges in water security and clean energy access. Despite significant strides towards universal electricity access ([Source: World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS)), only [32.4% of people have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.H2O.SAFE.ZS). Climate change poses significant risks, affecting agricultural productivity and exacerbating food insecurity.

## Analysis

The region's vulnerability to climate change is evident in its reliance on rain-fed agriculture, which accounts for over [70% of total food production (FAO, 2019)](https://www.fao.org/3/a-i8491e/index.html). Climate-related shocks such as droughts and floods have led to significant crop failures, increased malnutrition rates, and heightened poverty levels. For example, the 2022-2023 drought in East Africa resulted in an estimated [loss in GDP (World Bank, 2024)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/02/22/world-bank-group-estimates-economic-losses-from-east-africa-drought).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water:** Invest in infrastructure projects like boreholes, pipelines, and rainwater harvesting systems to increase access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024). Prioritize communities with the lowest coverage rates.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Use:** Encourage investment in solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Implement feed-in tariffs or subsidies for renewable energy projects (IRENA, 2023).
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience:** Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters, improve irrigation infrastructure, and promote agroforestry practices to enhance resilience in farming communities (FAO, 2019). Provide training on climate-smart agricultural techniques.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require substantial funding. The current global investment in renewable energy is $[45 billion annually (IRENA, 2023)](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2023/Mar/IRENA-Global-Renewable-Energy-Investment-Report-2023.pdf), with a significant portion directed towards Sub-Saharan Africa. However, additional resources are needed to cover water security and climate adaptation projects. Partnerships between governments, international organizations, NGOs, and private sector entities can help mobilize this financing.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa needs urgent action on water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation to ensure sustainable development. By focusing on these critical areas through targeted interventions, the region can build a more resilient future for its populations. Governments, international organizations, and donors must prioritize funding and support for these initiatives to achieve universal access to safe drinking water and electricity and enhance resilience against climate change impacts.

**Call to Action:** We urge governments, international organizations, and donors to commit $[VERIFY] billion over the next 5 years towards infrastructure projects that increase access to safe drinking water and promote renewable energy use.
