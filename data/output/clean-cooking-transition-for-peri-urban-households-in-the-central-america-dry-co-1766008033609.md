**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

The Central America dry corridor is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts and water scarcity. This brief highlights the importance of micro-insurance schemes as a key adaptation strategy for enhancing water security and climate resilience in peri-urban households. By providing financial protection against climate-related shocks, micro-insurance can help stabilize incomes and ensure sustainable water resource management. The brief provides an overview of the current state of micro-insurance in the region, its impact on smallholder farmers, and challenges to implementation.

### Introduction

The Central America dry corridor spans across several countries, including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. This region is characterized by a semi-arid climate with limited rainfall, making it prone to droughts and water scarcity. Climate change has exacerbated these conditions, resulting in increased frequency and severity of droughts. Smallholder farmers, who are heavily dependent on rainfall for their livelihoods, are among the most vulnerable populations.

Micro-insurance schemes offer a promising mechanism to bolster resilience among smallholder farmers. By providing financial protection against climate-related shocks, micro-insurance can help stabilize incomes and ensure sustainable water resource management. This brief will provide an overview of the current state of micro-insurance in the region, its impact on smallholder farmers, and challenges to implementation.

### Background on Micro-insurance Schemes

Micro-insurance schemes are designed to provide financial protection against specific risks or events, such as crop failure due to drought or flood. These schemes typically involve a premium paid by the policyholder, which is then used to pay out claims in case of an event. The basic structure of micro-insurance schemes includes:

* **Premium collection**: Policyholders pay a premium, usually on a monthly or annual basis.
* **Risk assessment**: Insurers assess the risk and determine the likelihood of a payout.
* **Payouts**: In case of an event, policyholders receive payouts to cover losses.

Case studies from other regions with similar environmental stressors have shown the effectiveness of micro-insurance schemes. For example:

* **Caribbean region**: Micro-insurance programs have been implemented in several Caribbean countries, providing financial protection against hurricane-related damage.
* **Mekong Basin**: Micro-insurance schemes have been introduced to support smallholder farmers in the Mekong Delta, protecting them against flood and drought-related losses.

### Water Security and Climate Resilience

Micro-insurance schemes can play a crucial role in supporting water management practices, such as irrigation and groundwater recharge. By providing financial protection against climate-related shocks, micro-insurance can help stabilize incomes and ensure sustainable water resource management. Integration of climate adaptation strategies within insurance schemes can enhance resilience against future shocks.

Some examples of successful micro-insurance programs already implemented include:

* **Guatemala**: The Guatemalan government has introduced a micro-insurance program to support smallholder farmers against drought-related losses.
* **Honduras**: A micro-insurance scheme has been implemented in Honduras to protect smallholder farmers against flood-related damage.

### Actions/Recommendations

Based on the findings of this brief, we recommend:

1. **Scaling up micro-insurance programs**: Governments and development agencies should scale up micro-insurance programs to reach more smallholder farmers.
2. **Integration with climate adaptation strategies**: Micro-insurance schemes should be integrated with climate adaptation strategies to enhance resilience against future shocks.
3. **Capacity building**: Capacity-building programs should be implemented to support insurers, policyholders, and other stakeholders in understanding the benefits and mechanics of micro-insurance.

### Closing Outlook

The Central America dry corridor is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Micro-insurance schemes offer a promising mechanism to bolster resilience among smallholder farmers. By providing financial protection against climate-related shocks, micro-insurance can help stabilize incomes and ensure sustainable water resource management. We hope that this brief will contribute to the development of effective adaptation strategies in the region.
