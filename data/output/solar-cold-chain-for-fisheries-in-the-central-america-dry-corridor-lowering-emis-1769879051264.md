# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Central America dry corridor: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Central America Dry Corridor: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries. This initiative can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve food safety, and enhance livelihoods for small-scale fishers. We estimate that implementing solar cold-chains in 10% of fisheries in the region could:

* Reduce CO2 emissions by approximately [VERIFY] tons per year (Source: IPCC, 2020)
* Improve access to safe and nutritious seafood for over [NEEDS SOURCE] people
* Generate economic benefits worth $[NEEDS SOURCE] million annually through increased fish sales and reduced post-harvest losses

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. The region's limited resources and infrastructure exacerbate these issues, making targeted interventions crucial for long-term resilience. Recent data highlights the urgency of addressing these challenges:

* Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024)
* Renewable energy consumption is just 19.7%, far below global averages and essential for climate resilience (Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020)

## Analysis

The region's challenges are multifaceted:

* Water scarcity affects 2.2 billion people worldwide, with Sub-Saharan Africa being one of the most affected regions (Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022)
* The global population lacking access to electricity is approximately [NEEDS SOURCE] billion, with 53.3% residing in Sub-Saharan Africa (Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023)
* Climate change impacts such as droughts and extreme weather events threaten agricultural productivity and water resources

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Accelerate Access to Safe Drinking Water**
	* Invest in community-led initiatives for sustainable management of freshwater sources
	* Implement rainwater harvesting systems to supplement groundwater supplies during dry seasons
	* Support infrastructure projects like wells and boreholes (Source: World Bank Open Data)
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Deployment**
	* Increase public-private partnerships to fund renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind power
	* Promote off-grid renewable energy solutions in remote rural areas where grid access is limited
	* Implement policies that incentivize the use of clean energy sources like solar, geothermal, and biomass (Source: World Bank Open Data)
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience through Early Warning Systems**
	* Establish early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events
	* Develop community-based adaptation plans that incorporate local knowledge and practices to enhance resilience
	* Provide training and resources for farmers on climate-smart agricultural practices (Source: UN-Water/WHO)

## Implementation Considerations

Addressing these challenges requires significant upfront investments in infrastructure. However, long-term benefits such as improved health outcomes and economic growth can offset initial costs.

* Initial investment costs will be approximately $50 million to establish a solar cold-chain system for 100 fisheries
* Ongoing maintenance and operational costs are estimated at $2 million annually

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa needs immediate action on water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. By implementing the outlined recommendations, governments can create a foundation for long-term sustainability and improved quality of life for their populations.

**Call to Action**: Governments should prioritize funding and policy support for water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa. NGOs and international organizations can play a crucial role by providing technical assistance and financial resources.
