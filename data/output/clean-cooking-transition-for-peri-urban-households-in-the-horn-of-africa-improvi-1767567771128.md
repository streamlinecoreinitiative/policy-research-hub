# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Horn of Africa: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa faces significant challenges due to severe droughts and heatwaves, affecting peri-urban households. The transition to clean cooking practices is crucial for improving health outcomes during extreme weather events.

## Environmental Resilience in Peri-Urban Households

### Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts

*   The Horn of Africa has a semi-arid climate with erratic rainfall patterns.
*   Climate change exacerbates water scarcity, affecting agriculture, livestock, and human consumption.
*   Peri-urban households rely on boreholes or canals for irrigation and drinking water.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

*   Existing irrigation systems suffer from high evaporation rates.
*   Water loss through seepage is significant due to inadequate infrastructure.
*   Crop yields are reduced, impacting food security and economic stability.

## Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

*   Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
*   Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry systems enhance water retention (e.g., [Case Study 1], [Case Study 2]).

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficient Irrigation

*   Small-scale hydroelectric systems provide a reliable energy source for irrigation pumps.
*   Reduced reliance on diesel generators decreases greenhouse gas emissions and operating costs.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

*   Pilot projects showcase the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
*   Economic analysis highlights cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

### Needed Evidence and Data Citations

*   Verification is needed for climate data, economic analysis, and socioeconomic studies.
*   World Bank datasets provide insights into renewable energy consumption and electricity access.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Support policy development**: Encourage governments to implement subsidies, low-interest loans, and infrastructure development for integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
2.  **Scale up pilot projects**: Expand successful pilot initiatives to larger areas, ensuring community engagement and participation.
3.  **Conduct further research**: Investigate long-term sustainability assessments, community acceptance strategies, and potential benefits of integrated systems.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households is crucial for improving health outcomes during heatwaves. The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to address water scarcity and climate change impacts in the Horn of Africa. By supporting policy development, scaling up pilot projects, and conducting further research, we can enhance environmental resilience, improve health outcomes, and promote sustainable development in this region.
