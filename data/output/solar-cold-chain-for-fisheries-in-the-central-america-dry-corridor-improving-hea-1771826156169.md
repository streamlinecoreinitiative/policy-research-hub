**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Central America Dry Corridor: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, governments should prioritize investments in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries. This innovative approach can improve health outcomes during heatwaves by reducing fish spoilage and ensuring a steady supply of safe food to vulnerable communities. Specifically, we recommend:

* Investing $10 million in solar-powered cold-chain infrastructure for fisheries in the Central America dry corridor over the next 2 years.
* Providing training and technical assistance to local fishermen and fishing communities on sustainable fishing practices and cold-chain management.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With only [32.4%] [VERIFY] of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (compared to 73.7% globally) [1], and just [53.3%] [VERIFY] with electricity access (versus 91.6% worldwide) [2], these issues are urgent priorities threatening economic growth, public health, and stability in the region.

Climate change exacerbates these challenges by intensifying droughts, floods, and extreme weather events, which further strain already limited resources. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to over [2 billion people] [VERIFY] who lack safe water [3], underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive interventions that integrate clean energy solutions and climate adaptation strategies.

## Analysis

The region's reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation (19.7% of total final energy consumption) [4] exacerbates air pollution and contributes to carbon emissions, further destabilizing regional economies and ecosystems. The lack of renewable energy access is particularly acute in rural areas where it often serves as the primary source of power.

In terms of water resources, 9.2% of freshwater withdrawals are for agriculture, with inefficient irrigation practices contributing significantly to water loss and pollution [5]. This not only diminishes available supplies but also contaminates water sources, posing risks to human health and aquatic ecosystems.

Climate change impacts, such as rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, have already begun affecting agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that climate-related shocks could reduce maize yields by 5-20% by 2030 across the region [6].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges effectively, decision-makers should prioritize and implement the following actionable steps:

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Invest in water harvesting technologies such as rainwater harvesting ponds to augment supply during dry periods.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Transition**: Encourage the adoption of clean energy sources like solar photovoltaic (PV) technology for electricity generation.
3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Measures**: Develop early warning systems for climate-related hazards, including droughts and floods.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require a combination of financial support from both domestic and international sources, coupled with institutional reforms to ensure sustainability. For instance, grants or concessional loans could be used for infrastructure development, while capacity-building programs would help equip local communities with the necessary skills to maintain and operate these systems.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a multifaceted approach that leverages existing data and evidence. By focusing on these critical areas, policymakers can foster resilience and ensure sustainable development outcomes for the region's diverse populations. We urge governments to prioritize funding and implementation of these recommendations within their national budgets.
