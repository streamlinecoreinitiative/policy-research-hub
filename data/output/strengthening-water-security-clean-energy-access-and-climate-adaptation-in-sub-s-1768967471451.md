# Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa

**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize investments in water infrastructure, renewable energy sources, and climate adaptation programs to improve living standards and reduce vulnerabilities to environmental shocks. We recommend increasing investment in desalination plants, boreholes, and water treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water (32.4% of the population currently lacks access [1]). This brief outlines evidence-based recommendations aimed at closing the gap through improved water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation strategies.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa lags significantly behind the rest of the world in providing safe drinking water and reliable electricity. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], compared to 73.7% globally [2]. Access to electricity is even more limited at 53.3%, with only 91.6% of the global population having access [3].

### Analysis

Research shows that these disparities are exacerbated by climate change and environmental degradation, leading to frequent droughts and floods. Improved water security can mitigate health risks from contaminated water sources. Clean energy access is critical for reducing carbon emissions and improving livelihoods. Climate adaptation measures like early warning systems and resilient infrastructure are vital for safeguarding communities against future shocks.

According to the World Bank, freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of global resources [4]. This highlights the need for sustainable management of water resources. The UN-Water/WHO reports that 2.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water [5], emphasizing the urgent need for improved water security.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Investment in Water Infrastructure**: Invest in desalination plants, boreholes, and water treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Target: Increase access to safely managed drinking water to 50% by 2028 [6].
	* Actors: Governments, NGOs, private sector companies.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Sources**: Encourage solar power, wind energy, and small hydropower projects to increase clean energy access.
	* Target: Achieve 20% renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 [7].
	* Actors: Governments, private sector companies, international organizations.
3. **Implement Climate Adaptation Programs**: Develop early warning systems for floods and droughts, build climate-resilient infrastructure, and promote climate-smart agriculture.
	* Target: Reduce the number of people affected by natural disasters by 30% by 2030 [8].
	* Actors: Governments, NGOs, international organizations.

### Implementation Considerations

These interventions require substantial upfront investment but will yield long-term benefits in terms of health, economic growth, and resilience. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and the private sector is essential to ensure sustainable implementation. Funding mechanisms such as grants, loans, and public-private partnerships can support these initiatives.

### Conclusion

By focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, Sub-Saharan Africa can improve living standards while reducing vulnerabilities to future environmental shocks. Stakeholders must work together to implement these recommendations for a more resilient future.
