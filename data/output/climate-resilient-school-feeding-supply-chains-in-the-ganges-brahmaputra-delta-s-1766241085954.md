# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent flooding and droughts affecting agriculture and food security. The school feeding program relies heavily on local food systems that are often exposed to these climate-related risks.

## Climate-Resilient Irrigation Systems: A Critical Component of School Feeding Supply Chains

### Water Scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

The region is characterized by high population density, intensive agriculture, and limited water resources. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have led to more frequent and severe droughts and floods.

*   **Climate Data:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade) is needed to verify the extent of climate-related impacts on water availability.
*   **Economic Analysis:** Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects are required to demonstrate the economic benefits of integrating climate-resilient practices into school feeding supply chains.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

The majority of irrigation systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta rely on groundwater, which is becoming increasingly scarce due to over-extraction. This has led to a significant decline in crop yields and reduced food security for local communities.

*   **Description of existing irrigation systems:** Boreholes, canals, and other traditional irrigation methods are prevalent in the region.
*   **Analysis of water loss through evaporation and seepage:** Studies have shown that up to 50% of irrigated water is lost due to inefficient practices and infrastructure. [Verify]

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems, which integrate trees into agricultural landscapes, offer a range of benefits for climate resilience.

*   **Soil health:** Tree roots help maintain soil structure and fertility.
*   **Biodiversity:** Agroforestry systems promote biodiversity by providing habitat for wildlife and supporting ecological services.
*   **Carbon sequestration:** Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for efficient irrigation. Benefits include:

*   **Reduced reliance on diesel generators:** Micro-hydro systems eliminate the need for fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on imported energy.
*   **Increased energy efficiency:** Micro-hydro systems can achieve higher energy conversion rates than traditional power generation methods.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential for integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to improve water security and reduce climate-related risks. These initiatives focus on:

*   **Agroforestry-micro-hydro pilot projects:** Demonstration sites showcasing the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
*   **Economic analysis:** Cost-benefit analyses highlighting the economic benefits of integrating climate-resilient practices into school feeding supply chains.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, policymakers should:

1.  **Develop and implement policies supporting agroforestry-micro-hydro integration:** Governments can provide incentives for farmers to adopt these integrated practices.
2.  **Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure:** Governments and development partners can support the construction of climate-resilient irrigation systems, including micro-hydro facilities.
3.  **Foster community engagement and participation:** Local communities should be involved in decision-making processes.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems into school feeding supply chains offers a promising solution for climate-resilient agriculture in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By supporting this approach, policymakers can help reduce climate-related risks, improve food security, and promote sustainable development in the region.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

*   Develop and implement policies supporting agroforestry-micro-hydro integration.
*   Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure.
*   Foster community engagement and participation.
