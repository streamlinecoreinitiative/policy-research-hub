**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa is one of the most drought-prone regions globally, facing significant impacts on agriculture, food security, and livelihoods due to climate change. This brief explores micro-insurance as a mechanism to support smallholder farmers in managing drought risk, aligning with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to enhance climate resilience.

**Section 1: Introduction to Drought Risk and Climate Change Impacts**

The Horn of Africa is characterized by high temperatures, low rainfall, and frequent droughts. Climate change projections indicate a decline in precipitation, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and rising temperatures, which have severe consequences for agriculture, including reduced crop yields and decreased food security.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Smallholder farmers in the Horn of Africa rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture, with limited access to irrigation systems. Existing irrigation practices often result in significant water losses through evaporation and seepage, exacerbating drought risks. The lack of reliable and efficient irrigation systems hinders agricultural productivity.

**Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices can enhance soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, improving water retention and reducing erosion. Integrating micro-hydro systems with agroforestry can provide a reliable source of clean energy and increase irrigation efficiency.

**Section 4: Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk**

Micro-insurance provides smallholder farmers with financial protection against drought-related losses by pooling risk and providing payouts in the event of drought. This can help farmers recover from crop failures, maintain livelihoods, and invest in climate-resilient agriculture practices.

**Recommendations and Actions**

1. **Develop and implement micro-insurance programs tailored to smallholder farmer needs**, integrating with existing climate adaptation initiatives.
2. **Support research and development of climate-resilient irrigation systems**, including agroforestry-micro-hydro integration.
3. **Strengthen policy frameworks and institutions** to facilitate adoption and scaling up of micro-insurance and climate-resilient agriculture practices.

**Closing Outlook**

The Horn of Africa's smallholder farmers face significant drought risks, exacerbated by climate change. Micro-insurance offers a promising solution for managing these risks, while agroforestry-micro-hydro integration provides a sustainable approach to irrigation efficiency. By supporting the development and implementation of micro-insurance programs and promoting climate-resilient agriculture practices, we can enhance adaptation targets in NDCs.

**Note:** The following data points require verification:

* Average annual rainfall in selected regions [verify]
* Specific water loss percentages from existing irrigation systems [verify]
* Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects [verify]

Changes made:

- Removed speculative claims and unverified numbers.
- Flagged necessary data points as "[verify]" to indicate the need for further research.
- Preserved the title, which is specific and consistent with the outline.
- Tightened language throughout the brief while maintaining a formal tone.
