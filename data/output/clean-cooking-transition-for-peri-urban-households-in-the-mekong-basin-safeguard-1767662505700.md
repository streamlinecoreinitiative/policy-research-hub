# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Mekong Basin: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

The transition to clean cooking practices is crucial for peri-urban households in the Mekong basin, where water security and climate adaptation are pressing concerns. This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

## Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Mekong basin, leading to erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from wetlands. This has significant economic implications, including high labor costs for constructing and maintaining irrigation systems, as well as high fuel costs for diesel generators.

### Key Statistics:

* Erratic rainfall patterns leading to reduced water availability [verify]
* Increased evaporation from wetlands exacerbating water scarcity issues [verify]

## Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation systems in the Mekong basin are often inefficient, resulting in significant water losses due to poor canal design. This not only affects agricultural productivity but also increases energy consumption.

### Key Statistics:

* Water loss due to poor canal design (evaporation and seepage) [verify]
* Diesel generator maintenance costs ($50 per month) [verify]

## Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, increase biodiversity, and promote natural pest control and pollination services. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, communities can enhance their resilience to climate change.

### Key Statistics:

* Improved soil structure with increased moisture retention [verify]
* Examples of successful agroforestry projects demonstrating improved water retention and reduced erosion

## Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency and Energy Savings

Micro-hydro systems offer a renewable energy source for irrigation systems, reducing reliance on diesel generators. This not only saves energy but also decreases maintenance costs.

### Key Statistics:

* Renewable energy source for irrigation systems (e.g., reduction in diesel generator usage) [verify]
* Examples of successful micro-hydro projects showing improved water delivery

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Integrate Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems**: Implement pilot projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in improving agricultural resilience.
2. **Provide Subsidies and Grants**: Offer government subsidies for initial investment on micro-hydro system installation [verify]
3. **Develop Infrastructure**: Support community-led micro-hydro system installations with local government support

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices is crucial for peri-urban households in the Mekong basin, where water security and climate adaptation are pressing concerns. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, communities can enhance their resilience to climate change, reduce energy consumption, and promote sustainable land management.
