Here's the revised brief:

# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Enhancing Food Security During Droughts

## Executive Summary

Climate change is exacerbating droughts in the Sahel region, affecting food security and livelihoods of millions of people. This brief highlights the importance of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in addressing water scarcity and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

## Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Sahel

Climate change is altering rainfall patterns, leading to more frequent and severe droughts in the Sahel region. This has significant implications for agriculture, as crops require reliable water sources to thrive. The impact of climate change on agriculture can be seen in:

* Erratic rainfall patterns: Rainfall variability increases crop failure rates.
* Increased evaporation: Rising temperatures enhance evaporation from soil and plants.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry practices promote soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. When combined with micro-hydro systems, these practices can:

* Improve water retention: Agroforestry helps retain water in the soil.
* Increase irrigation efficiency: Micro-hydro systems provide reliable and renewable energy for pumping water.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in School Feeding Supply Chains

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains. This approach:

* Enhances crop yields: Efficient irrigation leads to increased crop yields.
* Promotes sustainable agriculture practices: Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, we recommend:

1. **Invest in agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems**: Governments and development agencies should invest in pilot projects to demonstrate their effectiveness.
2. **Develop policy frameworks**: Governments should establish policies supporting the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains.
3. **Capacity building and training**: Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers, schools, and government officials on sustainable agriculture practices.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of water scarcity and its impact on food security in the Sahel region.
2. Develop a policy framework supporting the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains.
3. Establish partnerships between governments, development agencies, and local communities to promote climate-resilient agriculture practices.

## Closing Outlook

Climate change is a pressing issue in the Sahel region, affecting food security and livelihoods. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into school feeding supply chains, we can promote sustainable agriculture practices and reduce water scarcity.
