# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Central America dry corridor: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Central America Dry Corridor: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and frequent heatwaves that exacerbate landslide risks. This brief proposes a comprehensive approach to address these interconnected challenges through nature-based solutions.

**Climate Change Impacts on Water Scarcity and Landslide Risk**

Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, increased evaporation from wetlands, and reduced water availability for crops in the Central America dry corridor. Rising temperatures contribute to heatwaves that strain water resources and increase landslide risks.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers. These systems often lose a significant amount of water through evaporation and seepage due to poor canal design. The costs associated with traditional irrigation methods include:

* [Verify] $100 per day for manual labor in constructing and maintaining irrigation systems
* [Verify] $50 per month for diesel generator fuel

**Nature-Based Solutions: Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems**

Agroforestry can provide a sustainable solution to water scarcity by improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and increasing water retention capacity. Micro-hydro systems can be integrated with agroforestry to provide renewable energy for irrigation.

**Benefits and Cost Savings**

The proposed nature-based solutions offer numerous benefits, including:

* Improved soil structure and water retention capacity
* Increased biodiversity providing natural pest control and pollination services
* Reduced need for chemical inputs and associated costs
* Energy savings through reduced reliance on diesel generators

**Policy Recommendations**

To support the adoption of these nature-based solutions, we recommend:

1. **Subsidies and Grants**: Provide government subsidies or grants to support initial investments in micro-hydro system installation.
2. **Infrastructure Development**: Fund infrastructure improvements needed to facilitate the implementation of these solutions.

**Future Research Directions**

To ensure the long-term sustainability of these integrated systems, we suggest:

1. **Long-term Sustainability Assessments**: Conduct studies on the impacts of these systems over a 5-year monitoring period.
2. **Community Engagement Strategies**: Develop methods for engaging local communities in planning, implementation, and monitoring phases of these projects.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Conduct a thorough assessment of climate change impacts on water scarcity and landslide risk in the Central America dry corridor.
2. Develop a comprehensive plan to integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for irrigation efficiency.
3. Provide subsidies or grants to support initial investments in micro-hydro system installation.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed nature-based solutions offer a promising approach to addressing the interconnected challenges of water scarcity, landslide risk, and heatwaves in the Central America dry corridor. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water security, improve renewable energy use, and increase agricultural resilience in the region.
