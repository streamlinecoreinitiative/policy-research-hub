# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Indus watershed: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Indus Watershed: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

The Indus watershed, spanning across Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, China, and Tajikistan, is facing severe climate variability, leading to frequent droughts and water scarcity. Smallholder farmers in this region are particularly vulnerable to climate-related shocks, with limited access to resources and information on sustainable agricultural practices. This brief explores the potential of microfinance-driven agroforestry value chains as a solution to enhance climate resilience and economic stability among smallholder farmers in the Indus watershed.

**Climate Challenges in the Indus Watershed**

The Indus watershed is characterized by arid conditions, with frequent droughts and water scarcity affecting agriculture, livestock, and human consumption. Climate projections indicate an increase in temperature and variability of precipitation patterns, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities (UNEP, 2020). Smallholder farmers in this region rely heavily on traditional farming practices, which are often unsustainable and vulnerable to climate shocks.

**Current Agricultural Practices and Vulnerabilities**

Traditional farming methods in the Indus watershed are characterized by:

• Limited water sources: Groundwater depletion and surface water scarcity lead to reduced crop yields and lower productivity.
• Soil degradation: Intensive tillage, monoculture cropping, and lack of soil conservation measures contribute to soil erosion and nutrient depletion.
• Climate-related shocks: Droughts, heatwaves, and floods impact crop failures, livestock mortality, and human health.

**Microfinance-Driven Agroforestry Value Chains**

Microfinance institutions can support the establishment of agroforestry systems through targeted loans for:

• Tree planting and seedlings
• Soil conservation measures (e.g., terracing, contour farming)
• Diversified income streams from non-timber forest products (NTFPs) like honey, fruits, and medicinal plants

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil fertility, reduce erosion, increase water retention, and provide diversified income streams for smallholder farmers.

**Benefits of Agroforestry Value Chains**

The benefits of microfinance-driven agroforestry value chains include:

• Improved water retention: Reduced runoff and increased infiltration enhance crop yields and reduce irrigation needs.
• Increased soil fertility: Tree roots improve soil structure, increase organic matter, and promote nutrient cycling.
• Diversified income streams: NTFPs provide additional revenue sources for smallholder farmers, reducing dependence on a single crop or market.

**Challenges and Future Directions**

Despite the potential benefits of agroforestry value chains, challenges persist:

• Limited access to financing: Microfinance institutions often lack capacity to support agroforestry projects.
• Lack of awareness about agroforestry benefits: Smallholder farmers may not be aware of the advantages of agroforestry practices.
• Policy and regulatory frameworks: Existing policies and regulations may hinder the growth and sustainability of agroforestry value chains.

**Recommendations**

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Strengthening microfinance institutions' capacity**: Training and technical assistance for microfinance institutions to support agroforestry projects.
2. **Awareness-raising campaigns**: Educating smallholder farmers about the benefits of agroforestry practices through outreach programs and community engagement.
3. **Policy and regulatory reforms**: Reviewing and revising existing policies and regulations to support the growth and sustainability of agroforestry value chains.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Indus watershed have the potential to protect livelihoods under climate stress by integrating tree planting with traditional farming practices. Microfinance-driven agroforestry value chains can provide a sustainable solution for smallholder farmers, enhancing soil health, reducing erosion, and improving resilience. Addressing the challenges and limitations highlighted in this brief will be crucial to unlocking the full potential of these initiatives.
