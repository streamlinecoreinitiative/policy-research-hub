**Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Caribbean SIDS: improving health outcomes in heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

Lower-income countries in the Caribbean face significant climate-related challenges that threaten food security, economic stability, and human health. This brief focuses on the critical role of micro-insurance schemes in enhancing environmental resilience against droughts, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change. The brief provides an overview of climate risks in lower-income countries, the benefits of micro-insurance schemes for drought risk mitigation, their impact on food security and livelihoods, economic and social impacts, challenges and barriers, and recommendations for scaling up these programs.

**Climate Risks in Lower-Income Countries**

Lower-income countries are highly vulnerable to climate change due to limited financial resources, infrastructure, and institutional capacity. Climate-related hazards such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves pose significant threats to food security and economic stability. In the Caribbean, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are particularly susceptible to climate-related disasters due to their geographical location and limited adaptive capacity.

* Key challenges:
	+ Erratic rainfall patterns
	+ Increasing frequency of extreme weather events
	+ Limited access to climate-resilient infrastructure and technologies

**Micro-insurance Schemes for Drought Risk Mitigation**

Micro-insurance schemes provide financial protection to farmers against drought-related losses. These schemes offer a range of benefits, including:

* Reduced financial burdens during droughts
* Improved access to credit and other financial services
* Enhanced resilience to climate-related shocks

Case studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of micro-insurance schemes in reducing poverty rates, improving food security, and increasing crop yields.

**Impact on Food Security and Livelihoods**

Micro-insurance schemes have a direct impact on farmers' income, crop yields, and food security. Indirect effects include:

* Support for livelihood diversification
* Improved resource management

The economic benefits of micro-insurance schemes include reduced poverty rates and increased resilience to shocks.

**Economic and Social Impacts**

Micro-insurance schemes have significant social impacts, including:

* Community cohesion and empowerment of rural women
* Reduced vulnerability to climate-related disasters

The economic benefits of micro-insurance schemes include:

* Reduced poverty rates
* Increased resilience to shocks
* Improved access to credit and other financial services

**Challenges and Barriers**

Despite the benefits of micro-insurance schemes, several challenges and barriers need to be addressed, including:

* Financial viability issues
* Limited access to insurance products
* Regulatory challenges

Potential solutions for overcoming these barriers include:

* Government policy support
* Private sector engagement
* Capacity building and training programs

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Government Policy Support**: Governments should provide policy support for micro-insurance schemes, including regulatory frameworks and incentives for private sector engagement.
2. **Private Sector Engagement**: The private sector can play a critical role in scaling up micro-insurance programs by providing financial resources and technical expertise.
3. **Capacity Building and Training Programs**: Capacity building and training programs are essential for strengthening the institutional capacity of micro-insurance schemes.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in lower-income countries require innovative solutions to address climate-related challenges. Micro-insurance schemes offer a promising tool for enhancing environmental resilience against droughts, improving food security, and reducing poverty rates. To scale up these programs, governments, the private sector, and development partners must work together to address the challenges and barriers identified in this brief.

**Key Data Points Needed**

* Number of farmers covered by micro-insurance schemes
* Average insurance payouts per farmer during droughts
* Percentage reduction in poverty rates due to micro-insurance programs
* Comparison of crop yield variability before and after implementing micro-insurance programs

**Data Gaps**

* Detailed breakdown of insurance product types available for farmers
* Longitudinal impact studies over multiple drought cycles
* Cost-effectiveness analysis compared to other climate adaptation measures
