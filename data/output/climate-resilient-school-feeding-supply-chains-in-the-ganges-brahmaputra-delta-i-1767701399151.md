# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, with over 150 million people. The area is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. This brief focuses on improving health outcomes for school-going children by enhancing water security, promoting clean energy, and adapting to climate-related stressors through climate-resilient school feeding supply chains.

## Climate Change Impacts in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

The region experiences high temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. According to NOAA's climate dataset, the average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm, with a variability range of [verify] mm (NOAA climate dataset).

### Traditional Irrigation Practices

Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems experience losses of up to 35% due to evaporation and seepage.

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, agroforestry has increased [verify]% soil organic matter, [verify]% biodiversity, and [verify] tons/ha/year carbon sequestration (Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems).

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation. These systems generate power ranging from 10-50 kW per system, with an energy efficiency of [verify]-% (Economic Analysis of Micro-Hydro Systems). The cost savings from micro-hydro systems compared to traditional irrigation methods are significant.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a cost-effective solution for climate-resilient water supply. The total project cost per hectare is estimated at $[verify]-$25,000, with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, we recommend:

* Subsidies for farmers to encourage the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure development, including roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements

## Actions/Recommendations List

1. Conduct a comprehensive climate risk assessment for school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
2. Develop a policy framework to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. Establish partnerships with local stakeholders, including farmers, schools, and government agencies, to promote the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta offer a critical opportunity to improve health outcomes for school-going children while promoting sustainable agriculture and water management practices. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water security, reduce energy costs, and adapt to climate-related stressors.
