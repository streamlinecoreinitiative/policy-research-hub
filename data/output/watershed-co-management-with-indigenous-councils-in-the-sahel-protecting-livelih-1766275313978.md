# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sahel: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Sahel region faces unprecedented climate-related challenges, including droughts and land degradation, threatening smallholder farmers' and pastoralists' livelihoods and food security. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a strategy for protecting livelihoods under climate stress.

## Introduction

The Sahel region spans across several countries in West Africa, including Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Chad. Climate change is exacerbating climate-related disasters, leading to more frequent and severe droughts and floods.

## Watershed Co-management: A Community-led Approach

Watershed co-management involves working with local communities to manage water resources sustainably. This approach recognizes the importance of traditional knowledge in maintaining ecosystem health and promoting sustainable land use.

### Benefits of Watershed Co-management

*   **Improved Water Security**: Watershed co-management helps conserve water resources, reducing the risk of droughts and floods.
*   **Enhanced Crop Yields**: Sustainable land use practices promote soil health, improving crop yields and reducing the need for fertilizers and pesticides.
*   **Promoting Biodiversity**: By preserving natural habitats, watershed co-management helps maintain ecosystem services.

## Case Studies: Successful Watershed Co-management Projects

Several projects in the Sahel region demonstrate the effectiveness of watershed co-management. For example:

### Project 1: Burkina Faso's Watershed Management Program

This project worked with local communities to develop a watershed management plan that integrated traditional knowledge with modern conservation practices.

### Project 2: Mali's Community-led Reforestation Initiative

This initiative engaged local communities in reforestation efforts, promoting sustainable land use practices and conserving water resources.

## Actions/Recommendations

To promote watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sahel region:

1.  **Support Community-led Initiatives**: Provide financial and technical support to community-led initiatives that integrate traditional knowledge with modern conservation practices.
2.  **Develop Context-specific Solutions**: Work with local communities to develop context-specific solutions addressing their unique needs and challenges.
3.  **Promote Policy Support**: Advocate for policy changes recognizing the importance of watershed co-management and indigenous councils in promoting sustainable land use.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils offers a promising approach for protecting livelihoods under climate stress in the Sahel region. By integrating traditional knowledge with modern conservation practices, communities can enhance water security, improve crop yields, and promote sustainable land use.

### Needed Evidence
