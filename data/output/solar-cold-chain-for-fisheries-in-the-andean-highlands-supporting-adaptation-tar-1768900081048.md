# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Andean highlands: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To address water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts in lower-income countries, we recommend prioritizing community-based watershed management programs, micro-insurance schemes for smallholder farmers, and solar-powered irrigation systems. These interventions can enhance resilience, improve quality of life, and foster economic growth.

Key Findings:

* Lower-income countries face significant gaps in access to safe drinking water (32.4% globally) [1] and electricity (53.3%) [2].
* Renewable energy consumption is low at 19.7%, with over 2 billion people lacking safe water [3].

Recommendations:

* Prioritize water security through community-based watershed management and micro-insurance schemes for smallholder farmers.
* Enhance clean energy access by promoting solar-powered irrigation systems in rural areas.
* Invest in climate adaptation strategies such as mangrove restoration projects to protect freshwater ecosystems.

## Context & Challenge

Many lower-income countries struggle with limited resources, infrastructure, and technological capacity, making them vulnerable to environmental shocks. Climate change exacerbates existing challenges, leading to more frequent droughts, floods, and water scarcity [4]. Immediate action is critical to mitigate adverse impacts on health, agriculture, and economic stability.

## Analysis

Water Security:

* Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind globally in access to safe drinking water (32.4% vs 73.7%) [1].
* Community-based solutions like micro-insurance programs can provide financial protection against droughts, ensuring sustainable water use.

Clean Energy Access:

* Renewable energy consumption is low at just 19.7%, with Sub-Saharan Africa's access to electricity at 53.3% [2].
* Promoting solar-powered irrigation systems in rural areas can significantly reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enhance agricultural productivity while lowering carbon emissions.

Climate Adaptation:

* Mangrove restoration projects in the Andean highlands offer a cost-effective solution for protecting freshwater ecosystems from erosion, flooding, and sea-level rise [5].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security**:
	* Implement community-based watershed management programs to improve water quality and supply.
	* Establish micro-insurance schemes for smallholder farmers to mitigate drought risks and ensure sustainable water use.

2. **Clean Energy Access**:
	* Invest in solar-powered irrigation systems in rural areas to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enhance agricultural productivity.
	* Promote renewable energy technologies through grants, subsidies, and public-private partnerships.

3. **Climate Adaptation**:
	* Support mangrove restoration projects in the Andean highlands to protect freshwater ecosystems from erosion and flooding.
	* Collaborate with local communities for effective climate adaptation strategies tailored to specific environmental conditions.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these interventions requires substantial investment, including grants, subsidies, and public-private partnerships. However, long-term benefits outweigh initial costs through improved water security, enhanced energy access, and resilient ecosystems [6].

Potential Barriers:

* Limited financial resources and infrastructure in lower-income countries may hinder implementation.
* Resistance from communities or stakeholders who are skeptical of new technologies or initiatives.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to build sustainable futures. By adopting targeted policies and fostering collaboration at all levels, these nations can enhance resilience and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
