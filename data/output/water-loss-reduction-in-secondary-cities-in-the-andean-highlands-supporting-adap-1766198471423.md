**Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Ethiopian Highlands are a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from highland wetlands. Traditional irrigation methods exacerbate poverty among smallholder farmers by being energy-intensive and costly. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a sustainable solution for resilient irrigation in the Ethiopian Highlands.

**Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands**

The Ethiopian Highlands are a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change (UN Environment Programme, 2020). Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from highland wetlands have significant impacts on agriculture, leading to reduced crop yields and decreased food security. The importance of resilient irrigation methods for economic stability cannot be overstated; smallholder farmers rely heavily on these systems to maintain livelihoods.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Ethiopian Highlands include boreholes and canals. However, these traditional methods are often energy-intensive and costly (World Bank, 2019). Water loss through evaporation and seepage is a significant challenge; specific data on water loss percentages from existing irrigation systems is needed for further analysis [verify].

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration (Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture, 2018). Case studies demonstrate that agroforestry systems can improve water retention and reduce erosion. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can enhance the resilience of irrigation methods in the Ethiopian Highlands.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology involves small-scale hydroelectric systems that can provide a sustainable source of energy for irrigation (World Bank, 2019). Benefits include reduced reliance on diesel generators and increased energy efficiency. Pilot projects demonstrating the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro are crucial for scaling up this approach.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support adoption of these systems at scale, policy recommendations include:

* Providing incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Developing training programs for farmers on the design and maintenance of these systems
* Conducting socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions

Suggested areas for further research include:

* Economic impact analysis comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia, including rainfall patterns [verify]
* Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for water security and renewable energy use in the Ethiopian Highlands. Supporting adaptation targets in NDCs while promoting climate resilience among smallholder farmers is crucial for ensuring food security and economic stability in this critical agricultural region.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop policy frameworks**: Governments should develop policies to support adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Conduct socioeconomic studies**: Conducting socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions is crucial for scaling up this approach.
3. **Provide incentives**: Providing incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems can encourage adoption at scale.
