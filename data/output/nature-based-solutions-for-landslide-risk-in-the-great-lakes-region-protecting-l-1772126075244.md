**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Great Lakes Region: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1] and less than half having access to electricity (53.3%, World Bank, 2023) [2], we must prioritize interventions that combine clean energy solutions, improved water management practices, and climate adaptation strategies targeting both rural and urban populations.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change due to its reliance on agriculture and natural resources (World Bank, 2021). The region's population growth combined with environmental degradation threatens sustainable development goals. Addressing these issues is crucial for reducing poverty, improving health outcomes, and fostering economic growth.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1], compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank, 2024) [3]. This disparity is exacerbated by limited freshwater resources, with only 9.2% being withdrawn sustainably (World Bank, 2021) [4].

### Clean Energy Access

Less than half of the region's population has access to electricity (53.3%, World Bank, 2023) [2], with rural areas being most severely impacted. This is further exacerbated by a renewable energy consumption rate of only [VERIFY] globally (World Bank, 2020).

### Climate Adaptation

Climate-related shocks like droughts and floods are becoming more frequent, leading to severe food insecurity and economic instability.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Access to Safe Water**:
	* Invest in infrastructure such as boreholes and rainwater harvesting systems (World Bank, 2024) [5].
	* Implement water purification technologies to improve the quality of drinking water.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**:
	* Expand solar energy initiatives for off-grid communities, leveraging existing renewable energy consumption rates of [VERIFY] globally (World Bank, 2020).
	* Support community-owned microgrids and grid-tied systems in rural areas.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Develop early-warning systems to predict climate events like droughts and floods.
	* Implement climate-resilient agricultural practices and support smallholder farmers through insurance schemes.

## Implementation Considerations

Collaborate with local governments, NGOs, and international partners to ensure the sustainability of projects. Allocate funds from existing development budgets. Estimated costs range from $10-$20 billion for water security initiatives and $5-$10 billion for clean energy access across Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank estimates).

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes both rural and urban communities. By implementing evidence-based interventions, we can significantly improve the lives of millions while contributing to global sustainability goals.
