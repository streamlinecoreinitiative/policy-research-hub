**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Dual Focus on Renewable Energy and Safe Drinking Water**

## Executive Summary
To address the pressing challenges of water security and clean energy access in sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend increasing renewable energy consumption and expanding access to safe drinking water through targeted interventions. Specifically, governments should prioritize community-based water supply systems, such as rainwater harvesting and boreholes powered by small-scale hydropower, to reach 50% of the population with safely managed drinking water within the next five years.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant disparities in clean water access (32.4%) [1] and electricity availability (53.3%) [2], underscoring the urgent need for policy initiatives to enhance environmental resilience [NEEDS SOURCE]. With only 19.7% of total final energy consumption coming from renewable sources worldwide, there is a pressing need to increase adoption in sub-Saharan Africa [2].

## Analysis
- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the global average (73.7%) [1] in access to safely managed drinking water, with only 32.4% of the population having such access [1].
- **Electricity Access**: The region's electricity availability (53.3%) [2] is significantly lower than the global average (91.6%) [2], highlighting a critical need for clean energy solutions.
- **Renewable Energy Consumption**: Sub-Saharan Africa has an opportunity to increase its renewable energy consumption, which currently stands at 19.7% of total final energy consumption worldwide [2].

## Policy Recommendations
To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Increase Renewable Energy Consumption**: Implement solar and wind projects to achieve a minimum of 30% renewable energy use in sub-Saharan Africa by 2028.
2. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Governments should prioritize community-based water supply systems, such as rainwater harvesting and boreholes powered by small-scale hydropower, to reach 50% of the population with safely managed drinking water within the next five years.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Cost Analysis**: Implementing these interventions will require significant investment in infrastructure and technology transfer. An estimated $1 billion is needed annually for renewable energy projects [NEEDS SOURCE] and $500 million for safe drinking water initiatives.
- **Barriers**: Political resistance, lack of funding, and inadequate institutional support can hinder implementation. Collaboration with international partners and local communities is essential for successful deployment.

## Conclusion
Sub-Saharan Africa's environmental resilience hinges on improved access to safe drinking water and clean energy. By focusing on renewable energy initiatives and expanding safe drinking water supplies, the region can significantly enhance its capacity to adapt to climate change and improve overall living standards.
