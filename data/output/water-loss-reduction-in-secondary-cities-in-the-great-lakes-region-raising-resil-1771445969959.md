**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. Despite progress on universal electricity access (53.3% in 2023), only 32.4% of the region has access to safely managed drinking water [1]. To address these disparities, we recommend implementing policies focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Specifically, governments should invest in rainwater harvesting systems to improve safe drinking water access (32.4%) and promote solar-powered irrigation pumps to enhance agricultural productivity and reduce reliance on diesel generators.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with limited access to safe drinking water (32.4% in 2024) and electricity (53.3% in 2023), exacerbating poverty, health risks, and impeding economic development [2]. These issues compound the region's vulnerability to climate change, making it essential to prioritize these areas for sustainable development.

### Analysis

Despite regional progress, significant gaps remain in water security and clean energy access. Kenya's water management and renewable energy initiatives have improved access but face ongoing challenges. Freshwater withdrawal is a pressing concern globally, with 9.2% of resources used worldwide in 2021 [3]. Renewable energy consumption has increased to 19.7% of global energy mix in 2020 [4].

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1.  Introduce policies focusing on water security and climate adaptation.
2.  Encourage investment in renewable energy infrastructure.
3.  Implement programs for clean energy access, particularly in rural areas.
4.  Invest in rainwater harvesting systems to improve safe drinking water access (32.4%).
5.  Promote solar-powered irrigation pumps to enhance agricultural productivity and reduce reliance on diesel generators.

### Implementation Considerations

Establishing clear frameworks for funding, implementation, and monitoring is crucial for successful policy implementation. Estimated costs of solar-powered irrigation systems per hectare range from $500-$1,200 [5]. Expected return on investment in improved water security is 3-6 years [6].

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges with access to clean water, electricity, and renewable energy are profound. To address these disparities, governments must prioritize policies focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Developing detailed implementation plans, engaging stakeholders, and allocating resources will be essential for successful policy implementation.
