**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan African countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity due to climate variability and economic constraints. To bridge these gaps, we recommend investing in cost-effective water supply solutions, supporting renewable energy projects, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies. This brief highlights actionable policy recommendations that can help improve water security, promote clean energy adoption, and enhance climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately 1 billion people [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], with a vast majority lacking access to safely managed drinking water (32.4% vs. global average of 73.7%) [World Bank Open Data (2024)]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing the frequency and severity of droughts and floods, reducing water availability and power supply reliability [UN SDG Report 2023]. The region is lagging behind in achieving SDG 6 targets for safely managed drinking water and renewable energy consumption.

## Analysis

### Water Security

The percentage of population with access to safe drinking water remains far below global averages. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 32.4% have access to safely managed drinking water, compared to the world average of 73.7% [World Bank Open Data (2024)]. This highlights a significant need for improved infrastructure and technologies.

### Electricity Access

Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world average in electricity coverage, with only 53.3% of its population having access to reliable power [World Bank Open Data (2023)].

### Renewable Energy Consumption

Despite international commitments, renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7%, falling short of global targets and hindering the region's ability to transition towards sustainable energy sources [World Bank Open Data (2020)]. However, this number is inconsistent with other data points, and further research is needed to verify its accuracy.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Implement cost-effective rainwater harvesting systems for rural communities, reducing reliance on external water sources.

2. **Develop Microgrids and Off-Grid Solar-Powered Mini-Grids**: Develop microgrids and off-grid solar-powered mini-grids to provide electricity in remote areas, promoting energy access and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
	* Encourage investments from both public and private sectors, including grants and concessional loans.

3. **Promote Climate-Smart Agriculture Practices**: Promote climate-smart agriculture practices that enhance water management and resilience, improving crop yields and reducing the impact of droughts and floods.
4. **Establish Early Warning Systems**: Establish early warning systems for droughts and floods to mitigate their impact on food security and energy supply.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these solutions will require significant upfront investments, including infrastructure development costs, technology procurement, and training programs for local communities. Addressing barriers to adoption, such as political instability and limited financial resources, is crucial through targeted policy reforms. Engage with community leaders and stakeholders in planning and execution to ensure sustainability and efficacy.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa requires urgent attention towards enhancing water security, promoting clean energy adoption, and bolstering climate resilience. By implementing the recommended policies, governments can make significant strides toward achieving sustainable development goals and improving quality of life for millions of people living in these regions.
