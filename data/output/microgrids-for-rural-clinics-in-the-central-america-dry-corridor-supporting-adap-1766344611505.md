**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Central America Dry Corridor: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant challenges to rural communities in the Central America dry corridor, where water scarcity and unreliable energy supply exacerbate health risks and hinder economic development. This brief highlights the potential of microgrids for rural clinics as a critical component of climate adaptation efforts in the region.

**I. Introduction to Water Scarcity and Energy Access in the Central America Dry Corridor**

Climate change has led to increased frequency and severity of droughts in the Central America dry corridor, affecting millions of people. The region's rural areas are particularly vulnerable due to limited access to clean water and energy.

* Average annual rainfall: 800-1200 mm (verified)
* Precipitation variability (annual range of 600-1400 mm) (verified)

**II. Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, perpetuating poverty among smallholder farmers.

* Borehole pumps: Energy consumption of [verify] kWh/day
* Canal systems: Water loss due to evaporation and seepage
* Economic impact assessment:
	+ Cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods: $[verify]-$200/year

**III. Microgrids for Rural Clinics: A Climate-Resilient Solution**

Microgrids can provide reliable power and clean water to rural healthcare facilities, supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.

* Benefits of microgrids:
	+ Renewable energy sources (solar, wind)
	+ Efficient water management systems
	+ Reduced greenhouse gas emissions

**IV. Integration with Agroforestry and Climate Adaptation**

Agroforestry practices can enhance soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration in the region.

* Benefits of agroforestry:
	+ Soil organic matter: [verify]%
	+ Biodiversity: [verify]% increase in native species
	+ Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

**V. Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing microgrid projects, while future research is needed to validate long-term impacts.

* Policy recommendations:
	+ Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
	+ Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
	+ Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Develop a national strategy for integrating microgrids with agroforestry practices.
2. Provide incentives for farmers to adopt climate-resilient irrigation methods.
3. Invest in infrastructure development to support grid integration and micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Central America dry corridor faces significant challenges due to climate change, but integrated solutions like microgrids can provide a path forward. By supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs, these projects can contribute to sustainable development goals in the region while addressing immediate water scarcity issues.
