**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water, reliable electricity, and resilient infrastructure against climate change impacts. To address these interrelated issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in clean water infrastructure, increasing renewable energy deployment, and improving climate adaptation measures to meet SDG 6 goals. Specifically, governments, NGOs, and development practitioners should invest $[VERIFY] billion annually for the next five years in building or upgrading boreholes, pipelines, and storage facilities to ensure reliable access to safe drinking water [Source: UN-Water/WHO]. This investment will help increase access to safely managed drinking water from 32.4% to at least 50% by 2028.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity due to limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and inadequate sanitation facilities [1]. Climate change exacerbates these issues, leading to more frequent droughts and floods, which threaten food security and public health. The region's population is projected to grow from 1.2 billion in 2020 to 1.6 billion by 2030, putting additional pressure on already strained resources [2].

### Analysis

Access to safely managed drinking water is a critical challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Bank Open Data, only 32.4% of the population has access to safe drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally [3]. Renewable energy consumption is also low, with only 19.7% of total final energy consumption coming from renewables [4]. Climate impacts are increasing, with extreme weather events affecting both water availability and energy generation.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**: Allocate $[VERIFY] billion annually for the next five years to build or upgrade boreholes, pipelines, and storage facilities to ensure reliable access to safe drinking water.
2. **Increase Renewable Energy Deployment**: Implement solar-powered irrigation systems, rooftop solar panels for homes, and community-based wind power projects to increase renewable energy consumption to at least 30% by 2028.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Measures**: Develop early warning systems, build flood-resistant infrastructure, and promote drought-tolerant crops to improve climate resilience.

### Implementation Considerations

To implement these recommendations, governments should allocate dedicated funding streams for water and energy projects. Engage local communities in planning and implementation to ensure sustainability and ownership [5]. Collaborate with international partners to share best practices and technology transfer.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience are critical challenges that require immediate attention. Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must prioritize these interventions to accelerate progress towards sustainable development and poverty reduction in the region. By investing in clean water infrastructure, increasing renewable energy deployment, and improving climate adaptation measures, we can bridge the gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa's environmental resilience.

### Key Data Points to Cite

* **Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024)**: 32.4 [1]
* **Renewable energy consumption (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2021)**: Only 19.7% from total final energy consumption [4]
* **Global population lacking safe water (2022)**: 2.2 billion people [3]
* **SDG 6 progress - safely managed water**: 74% global coverage but only 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa [3]
