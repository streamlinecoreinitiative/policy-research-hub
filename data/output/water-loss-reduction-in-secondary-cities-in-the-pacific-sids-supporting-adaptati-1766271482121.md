# Enhancing Water Security in Pacific SIDS: Integrating Agroforestry with Micro-Hydro Systems

## Executive Summary

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant environmental challenges due to their geographical location and climate vulnerability. One critical area of concern is water security, essential for sustainable development, food security, and economic stability. This brief focuses on reducing water loss in secondary cities in the Pacific SIDS by promoting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). It emphasizes the importance of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in Secondary Cities

Secondary cities in the Pacific SIDS are characterized by rapid urbanization, limited infrastructure, and inadequate water management practices. Climate change exacerbates these challenges through erratic rainfall patterns, increased evaporation from wetlands, and sea-level rise. As a result, secondary cities face severe water scarcity, affecting agricultural productivity, food security, and economic stability.

### Key Challenges:

* Rapid population growth and urbanization
* Limited infrastructure for water management
* Inadequate adaptation measures in NDCs
* High reliance on diesel generators for energy

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Sustainable Solution

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address water scarcity and promote renewable energy use. These integrated systems combine agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric power generation, enhancing both water retention and energy efficiency.

### Benefits:

* Reduced reliance on diesel generators
* Increased energy efficiency through hydroelectric power
* Improved soil health and biodiversity through agroforestry
* Enhanced water retention and reduced erosion

## Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs: Policy Recommendations

To support adaptation targets in NDCs, we recommend the following policy measures:

### Key Recommendations:

1. **Integrate Agroforestry with Micro-Hydro Systems**: Encourage pilot projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Strengthen Water Management Infrastructure**: Invest in infrastructure for water collection, storage, and distribution in secondary cities.
3. **Promote Renewable Energy Use**: Support the transition from diesel generators to renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power.
4. **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Integrate climate-resilient agriculture practices into NDCs, focusing on agroforestry and water management.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct a thorough assessment of secondary cities in the Pacific SIDS to identify areas with high potential for agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop a comprehensive policy framework to support the integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems.
3. Establish partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector organizations to facilitate pilot projects and knowledge sharing.
4. Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for local communities to adopt climate-resilient agriculture practices.

## Closing Outlook

Reducing water loss in secondary cities in the Pacific SIDS requires a multi-faceted approach that integrates agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. By supporting adaptation targets in NDCs, we can promote sustainable development, improve food security, and enhance economic stability in these vulnerable communities.
