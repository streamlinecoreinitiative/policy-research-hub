**Protecting Livelihoods in Drylands: Safeguarding Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience through Integrated Approaches**

### Executive Summary
This policy brief highlights the urgent need to protect livelihoods in dryland regions of Sub-Saharan Africa by safeguarding water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. To address this challenge, we recommend implementing community-led watershed management programs, accelerating microgrid deployment for clean energy, and enhancing climate-resilient infrastructure projects.

Key findings:

* Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)].
* Renewable energy consumption is at just 19.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)].

Recommendations:
Implement community-led watershed management and microgrids for clean energy in rural areas; prioritize climate-resilient infrastructure projects.

### Context & Challenge
Dryland regions are highly susceptible to climate variability, leading to water scarcity and irregular rainfall patterns. These conditions exacerbate existing poverty levels, reducing food security and economic stability. Without immediate interventions, these communities will continue to suffer from reduced livelihoods and potential migration and conflict [Source: UN-Water/WHO (2022)].

### Analysis
Studies show that improving access to clean energy can reduce dependence on fossil fuels and improve livelihoods. Investments in water infrastructure like rainwater harvesting systems have proven effective in enhancing local resilience [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. However, high costs associated with implementing these solutions and limited availability of skilled labor for construction and maintenance pose significant challenges.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Implement Community-Led Watershed Management Programs**:
	* Train community members to manage their own watershed projects, including planting trees, constructing check dams, and setting up rainwater harvesting systems [Source: UNDP (2023)].
	* This approach has been successful in the Sahel region, where communities have seen significant improvements in water security and livelihoods.
2. **Accelerate Microgrid Deployment for Clean Energy**:
	* Design and implement microgrids that integrate solar panels with existing grid connections, providing reliable electricity to rural households [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)].
	* This approach has been shown to reduce energy costs and improve livelihoods in various regions.
3. **Enhance Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Projects**:
	* Invest in infrastructure like flood control systems and early warning systems for droughts, ensuring these projects are designed to withstand climate impacts [Source: UN Environment (2024)].
	* This approach has been successful in various regions, where communities have seen significant reductions in damage from natural disasters.

### Implementation Considerations
Initial investments may be high, but can be offset by long-term savings from reduced water and energy costs. Seek international funding opportunities through grants and development programs to address the high upfront costs associated with implementing these solutions.

### Conclusion
Protecting livelihoods in dryland regions requires strategic, integrated approaches that combine water security measures, clean energy access, and climate adaptation strategies. By taking decisive action now, governments and development partners can build more resilient communities capable of weathering future challenges.
