# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Great Lakes Region: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, particularly in lower-income countries where agriculture is a vital sector. The Great Lakes region faces severe water scarcity due to climate variability and increased evaporation from its vast wetlands. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a sustainable solution for enhancing both water security and renewable energy use in the region's critical agricultural sector.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Great Lakes Region

The Great Lakes region is characterized by erratic rainfall patterns, increased evaporation from its vast wetlands, and rising temperatures. These climate change impacts have severe consequences on agriculture, including reduced crop yields and decreased water availability. Traditional irrigation methods are often energy-intensive and costly.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Sustainable Solution

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. When integrated with micro-hydro technology (small-scale hydroelectric systems), these benefits can be amplified by reducing the reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency. Pilot projects demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of such integrated systems.

### Key Benefits:

• **Water Security:** Reduced water loss through evaporation and seepage
• **Renewable Energy:** Increased use of hydroelectric power, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels
• **Economic Stability:** Lower operational costs for farmers and communities

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale:

1.  Develop policies that incentivize the integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro technology.
2.  Establish training programs for smallholder farmers on sustainable irrigation practices.
3.  Conduct socioeconomic studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.

### Research Directions:

• **Climate Data:** Utilize existing climate datasets, such as NOAA's, for specific regions in the Great Lakes region
• **Economic Analysis:** [Verify] cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects
• **Socioeconomic Studies:** Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  Develop a comprehensive policy framework to support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  Establish partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and international organizations to implement pilot projects.
3.  Conduct further research on the economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability of these integrated solutions.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Great Lakes region require innovative solutions that address water scarcity and increase renewable energy use. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising approach to enhance both water security and sustainable energy production. By integrating policy support, training programs, and socioeconomic studies, we can accelerate the adoption of these integrated systems and contribute to food security in lower-income countries.
