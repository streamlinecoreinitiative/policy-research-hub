# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Pacific SIDS: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Pacific SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**
The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant challenges in achieving clean cooking practices, exacerbating climate stress and threatening livelihoods. With only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to safely managed drinking water ([NEEDS SOURCE]), there is an urgent need for actionable policies that can bridge this gap effectively. This brief outlines three key recommendations to enhance water security, promote clean energy, and build climate resilience in the Pacific SIDS.

**Context & Challenge**
The Pacific SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including sea-level rise, increased frequency of natural disasters, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources ([IPCC, 2019]). The lack of access to safely managed drinking water exacerbates health risks and undermines economic productivity. Electricity access is disproportionately low in the Pacific SIDS (53.3%), hindering socio-economic development and limiting access to essential services like healthcare and education.

**Analysis**
- **Water Security**: The World Bank reports that only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water ([World Bank, 2024]). This disparity contributes significantly to poor health outcomes and economic stagnation.
- **Clean Energy**: Renewable energy consumption in the Pacific SIDS is [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption globally ([World Bank, 2021]), far below the global average. This low adoption rate limits the region's ability to meet its climate goals and provides limited economic benefits.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change poses severe risks in the Pacific SIDS, including increased frequency and intensity of droughts and floods ([NOAA Climate Data]). These events have already led to significant crop failures, displacement of communities, and heightened health risks.

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Enhance Water Supply Infrastructure**:
   - Invest in desalination plants and water treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water.
   - Introduce subsidies for households to purchase water purification systems or install rainwater harvesting units ([World Bank, 2024]).

2. **Expand Renewable Energy Grids**:
   - Develop large-scale renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines to increase grid reliability and efficiency ([Global Renewables Outlook, 2023]).
   - Implement feed-in tariffs for small-scale renewable energy producers like rooftop solar panels to encourage widespread adoption.

3. **Strengthen Climate Resilience Programs**:
   - Establish early warning systems using satellite imagery and ground-based sensors to predict climate events.
   - Allocate resources for disaster preparedness and response, including the construction of flood barriers and improved drainage systems ([World Bank, 2025]).

**Implementation Considerations**
- **Costs**: Initial investments in infrastructure development can be substantial but pay off through long-term savings on healthcare costs and increased productivity. Renewable energy projects require significant upfront capital.
- **Barriers**: Limited funding from international donors and domestic governments pose a challenge to implementation. Stakeholder buy-in is crucial for successful project execution.

**Conclusion**
The Pacific SIDS urgently need robust policies that address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this brief, we can create sustainable pathways forward that benefit millions of people while fostering economic growth. International cooperation will be essential to providing the necessary resources and support to achieve these goals.
