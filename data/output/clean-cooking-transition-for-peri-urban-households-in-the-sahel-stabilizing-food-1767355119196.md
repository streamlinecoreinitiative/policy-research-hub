# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Sahel: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sahel: Enhancing Food Security during Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region faces increasing water scarcity and climate variability, leading to food insecurity due to droughts. This brief proposes an integrated approach to address these challenges by transitioning peri-urban households to clean cooking practices using agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity and Climate Change**

The Sahel region is characterized by erratic rainfall patterns, with average annual rainfall ranging from [verify] mm. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, losing significant amounts of water due to evaporation and seepage.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Their Limitations**

Traditional irrigation practices in the Sahel region rely heavily on fossil fuels, consuming a significant amount of energy per borehole pump. Canal systems are also inefficient, losing substantial amounts of water through evaporation and seepage.

**Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry is a sustainable land-use practice that improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits of agroforestry include:

* Soil organic matter increases by [verify]%
* Biodiversity increase by [verify] native species
* Carbon sequestration by [verify] tons/ha/year

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency and Clean Energy**

Micro-hydro systems provide a sustainable and renewable energy source, generating power ranging from 10-50 kW per system with an efficiency of [verify]%.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Policy Support:** Governments and international organizations should provide incentives for farmers to adopt clean cooking practices and invest in agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Infrastructure Development:** Infrastructure development, including roads and storage facilities, is essential for the successful implementation of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Capacity Building:** Training programs for farmers and local communities are necessary to ensure the effective adoption and maintenance of these systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed solution offers a comprehensive approach to addressing water scarcity, climate change, and food insecurity in the Sahel region. By transitioning peri-urban households to clean cooking practices using agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation, we can improve water security, provide sustainable energy, and enhance climate resilience in agriculture.
