# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Indus watershed: raising resilience finance for communities

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Indus Watershed: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

**Executive Summary**

The Indus watershed, spanning across several countries in South Asia, faces significant challenges in ensuring food security and climate resilience. The region's agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including droughts, floods, and temperature fluctuations. This brief proposes an integrated approach to addressing these challenges by combining agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with school feeding programs.

**Climate-Resilient Water Security: Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems**

The Ethiopian Highlands face severe water scarcity due to erratic rainfall patterns. Traditional irrigation systems, such as boreholes and canals, are energy-intensive and often inefficient, resulting in substantial water losses (30% through evaporation and 5% through seepage). To address this issue, agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution.

**Key Benefits of Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems**

*   **Improved Water Efficiency:** By harnessing the power of rainwater harvesting and micro-hydro energy, these systems can reduce water losses.
*   **Renewable Energy Generation:** Micro-hydro systems provide a reliable source of renewable energy, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.
*   **Soil Conservation and Carbon Sequestration:** Agroforestry practices enhance soil health, promote biodiversity, and sequester carbon dioxide.

**Clean Energy Adoption: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems offer a cost-effective solution for irrigation, generating power ranging from 10-50 kW per system with an energy efficiency of 70-80%. Compared to traditional irrigation methods, these systems can save up to 50% in energy costs.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro: Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems provides a cost-effective solution for climate-resilient water supply. Estimated project costs per hectare range from $10,000-$25,000, with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, policy measures can be implemented:

*   **Incentives for Farmers:** Subsidies, low-interest loans, or grants can encourage farmers to adopt these sustainable practices.
*   **Grid Integration:** Micro-hydro systems can be integrated with the grid, providing a reliable source of renewable energy.
*   **Infrastructure Development:** Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure can facilitate the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Develop a comprehensive policy framework to support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  Conduct further research on the economic viability of these systems and their potential for climate resilience.
3.  Establish partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to promote the implementation of these initiatives.

**Closing Outlook**

The Indus watershed faces significant challenges in ensuring food security and climate resilience. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with school feeding programs, this initiative aims to enhance water security, promote clean energy adoption, and support climate adaptation efforts in the region. With a focus on policy recommendations, future research directions, and actions, we can work towards creating a more resilient and sustainable agricultural sector in the Indus watershed.
