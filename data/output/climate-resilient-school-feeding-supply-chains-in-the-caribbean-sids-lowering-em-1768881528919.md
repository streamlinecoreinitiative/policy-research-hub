**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Caribbean SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Immediate action is required to strengthen climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS). With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1], and renewable energy consumption at a mere 19.7% [2], the region faces significant challenges in ensuring sustainable development goals are met. To address this, we recommend implementing climate-resilient school feeding supply chains that prioritize locally sourced ingredients, reduce food waste, and promote clean energy use.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most affected by climate change [3]. The region has seen a decline in freshwater resources due to overuse and pollution, exacerbating existing challenges like poverty and economic instability. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1], communities are facing health risks such as waterborne diseases. Similarly, electricity access is low (53.3%) [4], leading to limited opportunities for economic growth and development.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring safe and reliable water supplies. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, a figure that falls far short of global targets (73.7%) [1]. This disparity is driven by inadequate infrastructure, limited financial resources for maintenance, and unsustainable practices like overuse of groundwater.

### Clean Energy

Renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7% [2], compared to the world average. Sub-Saharan Africa relies heavily on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. The region lacks investment in renewable energy projects due to high costs and limited infrastructure for solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Invest in water harvesting technologies like rainwater harvesting and rooftop catchment systems to increase access to safe drinking water [5].
2. **Expand Renewable Energy**: Prioritize renewable energy projects by providing financial incentives for private sector investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Strengthen early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans through collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and local communities.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in water harvesting technologies and renewable energy projects can be substantial but are offset by long-term savings on health care costs due to improved water quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing barriers such as political resistance, lack of funding, and technical expertise will require community engagement, financial support from international organizations, and training programs for local technicians.

## Conclusion

To build resilient societies in Sub-Saharan Africa, immediate action is required on improving access to safe water, expanding clean energy options, and enhancing climate adaptation measures. By adopting evidence-based policies supported by practical interventions, decision-makers can significantly improve the lives of millions while contributing to global efforts toward sustainable development goals.
