# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Mekong Basin: Enhancing Disaster Resilience for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Mekong Basin is highly vulnerable to climate change, with severe droughts and floods affecting agricultural productivity and food security. The school feeding program, which provides meals to millions of students, is particularly susceptible to disruptions in supply chains due to extreme weather events. This brief proposes an integrated approach to enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

## Introduction to Climate Resilience in the Mekong Basin

The Mekong Basin is home to over 60 million people, with a significant portion relying on agriculture as their primary source of income. Climate change has led to increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods, resulting in crop failures and reduced agricultural productivity [verify]. The school feeding program, which provides meals to approximately 10% of the region's population, is particularly vulnerable to disruptions in supply chains due to extreme weather events.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Their Limitations

Traditional irrigation methods in the Mekong Basin are often energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume significant amounts of electricity [verify], while canal systems experience high losses due to evaporation and seepage [verify]. These inefficiencies not only increase costs but also exacerbate water scarcity, further reducing agricultural productivity.

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce soil erosion, increase crop yields, and enhance ecosystem services [verify]. In the Mekong Basin, agroforestry has been found to increase soil organic matter by 2-8% and biodiversity by 15-30 native species [verify].

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy for irrigation. With power generation ranging from 10-50 kW per system, micro-hydro can reduce energy costs and environmental impacts associated with traditional methods [verify]. In the Mekong Basin, micro-hydro systems have been found to achieve energy efficiency rates of 70-80% and cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide a cost-effective solution for climate-resilient water supply. With total project costs ranging from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare [verify], this integrated approach can reduce disaster losses and improve food security for vulnerable groups.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, policy measures are necessary to create a supportive environment. Subsidies for farmers can encourage the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, while grid integration with micro-hydro systems can enhance reliability and efficiency [verify]. Infrastructure development, including roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements, is also crucial for long-term sustainability.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the school feeding program's supply chains to identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.
2.  Develop and implement policies to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in agricultural landscapes.
3.  Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers, extension agents, and other stakeholders on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro practices.

## Closing Outlook

Climate change poses significant threats to food security and agricultural productivity in the Mekong Basin. The proposed solution of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a cost-effective and sustainable approach to enhancing climate resilience in school feeding supply chains. By reducing disaster losses and improving food security, this integrated approach can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ensuring a more resilient future for vulnerable communities.
