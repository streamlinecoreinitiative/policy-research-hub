# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Central America dry corridor: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Central America Dry Corridor: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**
Immediate action is required to enhance flood-resilient transport corridors in the Central America dry corridor, where climate change impacts have significantly increased disaster losses. This policy brief recommends investing $50-$100 per capita in infrastructure projects that integrate flood-resistant materials and designs into existing transportation networks.

## Context & Challenge
Lower-income countries face significant barriers to achieving water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience due to limited infrastructure, weak institutional frameworks, and economic constraints. In the Central America dry corridor, droughts and floods have devastating effects on agriculture, food security, and human settlements. The region's population has limited access to electricity (53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa) [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023] and water resources, exacerbating existing challenges.

## Analysis
- **Water Security**: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacks access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024].
- **Clean Energy Access**: In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023], highlighting significant disparities compared to global averages.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Global temperature rise since pre-industrial is +1.1°C [Source: IPCC AR6]. In Sub-Saharan Africa, climate change has led to more frequent droughts and heatwaves, impacting agricultural yields and water resources.

## Policy Recommendations
1. **Enhance Water Security**:
   - Invest in infrastructure projects for WASH services.
   - Promote rainwater harvesting and small-scale irrigation systems to improve water availability.
   - Implement community-based watershed management programs with indigenous councils.
   - Encourage the use of low-cost technologies like solar-powered pumps for accessing groundwater.

2. **Promote Clean Energy Access**:
   - Increase financing for renewable energy projects, particularly in off-grid settings where grid expansion is costly or impractical.
   - Support small-scale solar power installations and mini-grids to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
   - Implement policies that facilitate private sector investment in clean energy technologies.

3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
   - Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters, including droughts, floods, and heatwaves.
   - Integrate climate resilience into agricultural practices through climate-smart agriculture techniques.
   - Invest in disaster risk reduction infrastructure such as levees, dams, and flood barriers.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Cost Estimation**: Initial investments in water security projects could range from $50-$100 per capita [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. Clean energy initiatives might require $30-$70 per capita. Climate adaptation measures can cost between $10-$20 per capita.
- **Barriers to Implementation**:
   - Limited financial resources and funding constraints.
   - Weak institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks.
   - Social acceptance issues for new technologies like solar pumps or mini-grids.

## Conclusion
Building robust water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in lower-income countries requires targeted interventions that address specific challenges. By focusing on cost-effective solutions and leveraging existing community networks, these strategies can significantly improve the well-being of millions of people while fostering sustainable development pathways.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and international organizations must collaborate to implement the recommended policies. Leveraging available data and resources will be crucial for achieving meaningful progress towards water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in lower-income countries.
