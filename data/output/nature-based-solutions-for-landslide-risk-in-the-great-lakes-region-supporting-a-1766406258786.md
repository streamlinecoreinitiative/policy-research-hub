# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

Climate change exacerbates landslide risks in lower-income countries, particularly in regions like the Great Lakes, where water security and clean energy are critical to economic stability. This brief explores nature-based solutions, specifically agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, as a climate-resilient approach for irrigation.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Challenges and Opportunities

### Water Security and Clean Energy

*   Climate change alters rainfall patterns, leading to severe water scarcity in the Andean Highlands.
*   Existing irrigation systems (e.g., boreholes, canals) are inefficient, resulting in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage.
*   Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution by combining soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration benefits with reduced reliance on diesel generators.

### Climate Adaptation Targets in NDCs

*   The Paris Agreement emphasizes the importance of climate adaptation and resilience-building measures in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
*   Nature-based solutions like agroforestry-micro-hydro systems can contribute to achieving climate adaptation targets, particularly in regions vulnerable to landslides.

## Policy Recommendations for Scaling Up

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems

*   Pilot projects demonstrating the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro have shown promising results.
*   Economic analysis indicates cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

### Supporting Adoption at Scale

*   Policy recommendations include subsidies, low-interest loans, and infrastructure development to support adoption.
*   Suggested areas for further research include long-term sustainability assessments and community engagement strategies.

## Future Research Directions

### Climate Data and Socioeconomic Studies

*   Additional studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
*   Climate data (e.g., NOAA climate dataset) and socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these solutions are essential for informed decision-making.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Support policy development**: Collaborate with governments to develop policies that incentivize the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Scale up pilot projects**: Expand successful pilot projects to larger areas, ensuring effective integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro technology.
3.  **Conduct further research**: Address knowledge gaps through studies on long-term sustainability, community engagement, and climate data analysis.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient irrigation systems like agroforestry-based micro-hydro can mitigate landslide risks while promoting water security, clean energy, and economic stability in lower-income countries. By supporting the adoption of these nature-based solutions, we can contribute to achieving climate adaptation targets in NDCs and building more resilient communities worldwide.
