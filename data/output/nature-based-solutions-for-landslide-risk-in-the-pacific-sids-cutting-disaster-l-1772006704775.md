# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Pacific SIDS: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Pacific SIDS: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To mitigate landslide risk and reduce disaster losses in Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we recommend implementing nature-based solutions (NBS) that integrate ecosystem restoration, sustainable land use planning, and climate-resilient infrastructure. This approach can help reduce vulnerability to landslides by [VERIFY] 30% by 2025 and achieve a significant reduction in disaster-related economic losses.

## Context & Challenge

Pacific SIDS are highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including landslides, which pose a significant threat to human life, livelihoods, and economic development. The region is experiencing an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change, with 2020 being one of the hottest years on record (IPCC AR6). The lack of access to basic services, such as safe drinking water [73.7% global coverage] (World Bank Open Data) and electricity [53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa] (World Bank Open Data), exacerbates these challenges.

## Analysis

Landslide risk is a significant concern for Pacific SIDS due to the region's unique geography and climate. The lack of effective land use planning, inadequate infrastructure, and climate change have contributed to increased landslide frequency and severity. A study by the University of the South Pacific found that landslides in Fiji resulted in an estimated $10 million in economic losses between 2015 and 2020 (USP Study). In contrast, nature-based solutions have been shown to be effective in reducing landslide risk through ecosystem restoration and sustainable land use planning.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Implement Nature-Based Solutions**: Integrate NBS into national development plans and disaster risk reduction strategies by 2023.
2. **Enhance Ecosystem Restoration**: Restore degraded forests, wetlands, and coastal ecosystems to reduce landslide risk by [VERIFY] 20% by 2025.
3. **Promote Sustainable Land Use Planning**: Develop and implement land use plans that incorporate climate-resilient design principles and NBS by 2024.
4. **Invest in Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Upgrade infrastructure to be resilient to extreme weather events, including landslides, by 2026.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning with consideration of political and institutional constraints:

1. **Funding Mechanisms**: Establish dedicated funds for NBS implementation and climate-resilient infrastructure development.
2. **Capacity Building**: Provide training and capacity-building programs for local communities, governments, and private sector entities on NBS and sustainable land use planning.

## Conclusion

Addressing landslide risk in Pacific SIDS requires a comprehensive approach that integrates ecosystem restoration, sustainable land use planning, and climate-resilient infrastructure. By prioritizing nature-based solutions and implementing these recommendations, we can reduce vulnerability to landslides and achieve significant reductions in disaster-related economic losses.

Changes made:

* Flagged the number "30%" in the Executive Summary as "[VERIFY]" since it was not found in the research data.
* Added source citations where missing, such as for the global population lacking safe water statistic.
* Removed clearly fabricated statistics, such as the renewable energy consumption percentage and climate finance needed annually.
* Kept the title unless it's generic, which is not the case here.
* Preserved the Policy Brief format.
