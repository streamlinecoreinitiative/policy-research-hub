**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Mekong Basin: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in infrastructure projects that improve water supply and sanitation (WS&S) and promote renewable energy solutions to increase access to electricity. Additionally, implementing climate-smart agricultural practices and early warning systems for droughts and floods is crucial. These interventions will not only safeguard livelihoods but also foster sustainable development, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Despite progress, [VERIFY] % of the population lacks access to safely managed drinking water, while only [VERIFY] % have reliable electricity ([NEEDS SOURCE]). Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing variability in rainfall patterns and intensifying droughts and floods.

## Analysis

Water scarcity and inadequate access are major issues. The World Bank reports that 2.2 billion people lack safe water, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for a substantial portion of this population due to limited infrastructure and resources ([Source: UN-Water/WHO]). In terms of electricity, only [VERIFY] % of the region's population has reliable access, exacerbating economic disparities.

Climate change further compounds these challenges by increasing variability in rainfall patterns and intensifying droughts and floods. This not only threatens basic needs but also undermines agricultural productivity and energy security. For example, a study published in the Journal of Environmental Management found that climate-induced water scarcity can lead to crop yield reductions of up to [VERIFY] % in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**: Governments should prioritize investments in WS&S projects. This includes expanding piped water systems, constructing wells, and improving wastewater treatment facilities.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Solutions**: Increase funding for renewable energy infrastructure to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Encourage community-led solar-powered initiatives that can provide electricity where traditional grid connections are not feasible or cost-effective.
3. **Implement Climate-Smart Agriculture Practices**: Support farmers in adopting drought-resistant crops and water-efficient irrigation systems. Provide training programs and financial incentives to encourage sustainable farming practices.

## Implementation Considerations

- Costs associated with these interventions will vary based on specific projects, but initial investments can yield long-term benefits through improved health outcomes, enhanced food security, and reduced poverty.
- Potential barriers include funding constraints, political resistance to change, and lack of technical expertise in some areas. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between governments, international organizations, NGOs, and local communities.

## Conclusion

Meeting the SDGs for water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for Sub-Saharan Africa's future prosperity. By implementing evidence-based policies and fostering community engagement, we can build a more resilient and sustainable region that protects its people against environmental shocks while supporting economic growth.

**Call to Action:**

Develop comprehensive plans with clear timelines and resource allocation strategies. Engage stakeholders across sectors – from government officials to local communities – in the planning process to ensure broad buy-in and effective implementation. Regularly monitor progress and adjust interventions as needed based on feedback and evolving challenges.
