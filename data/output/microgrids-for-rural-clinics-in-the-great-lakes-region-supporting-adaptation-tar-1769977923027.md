**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. Recent data shows that only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank Open Data). Additionally, renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% worldwide, with a significant gap in the region (World Bank Open Data). To address these challenges, we recommend investing in microgrid projects for rural clinics, which can provide decentralized power solutions and improve access to electricity.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods. The region's reliance on non-renewable energy sources contributes to environmental degradation and further complicates efforts towards sustainable development. According to the World Bank Open Data, only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, far below the world average of 91.6%. This highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions focused on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation.

## Analysis

The data underscores the critical need for evidence-based policies that address these challenges effectively. For instance, increasing access to safe drinking water can be achieved through improved infrastructure projects like rainwater harvesting systems and boreholes (World Bank Open Data). In terms of electricity, microgrids offer a promising solution as they provide decentralized power solutions that are more resilient against grid failures and less expensive than traditional centralized grids.

Regarding climate adaptation, early warning systems and last-mile alerts have proven effective in improving health outcomes during heatwaves. Additionally, promoting renewable energy consumption can help reduce carbon emissions and mitigate future climate impacts (World Bank Open Data). The region's indigenous knowledge can also be harnessed to develop context-specific solutions for water management and climate resilience.

## Policy Recommendations

To effectively address these challenges:

1. **Invest in Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Allocate funds for the installation of rainwater harvesting systems in rural areas, which can provide an additional source of clean drinking water.
2. **Support Microgrid Projects**: Collaborate with international partners to support microgrid projects that provide decentralized power solutions for rural clinics and communities.
3. **Promote Renewable Energy Consumption**: Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power through incentives and subsidies for households and businesses.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning to ensure sustainability. Funding from international development partners will be crucial, alongside partnerships with local communities and private sector entities. Capacity building for government officials and community leaders is essential to sustain long-term success. Cost estimates indicate that initial investments in infrastructure may range between $10 million to $20 million per year, depending on the scale of projects implemented.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa demands immediate action. By adopting evidence-based policies and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, decision-makers can significantly improve the well-being and economic prospects of vulnerable communities in the region. We urge governments, NGOs, and international partners to prioritize these initiatives as part of broader development strategies.
