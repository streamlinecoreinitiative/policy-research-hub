# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Horn of Africa: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts and landslides that pose significant threats to freshwater ecosystems. This brief explores nature-based solutions to mitigate landslide risk and ensure water security in lower-income countries.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Challenges and Opportunities

### Water Security

*   Severe water scarcity affects agriculture, food security, and economic stability.
*   Climate change exacerbates erratic rainfall patterns, making resilient irrigation methods essential.
*   Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution by integrating water harvesting, storage, and efficient use.

### Clean Energy

*   Renewable energy sources are critical for reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.
*   Micro-hydro technology is suitable for small-scale hydroelectric systems, providing clean energy for irrigation and other applications.

### Climate Adaptation

*   Agroforestry systems improve water retention, reduce erosion, and enhance soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
*   Pilot projects demonstrate the effectiveness of combining agroforestry with micro-hydro technology in climate-resilient water supply.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

1.  **Support Adoption at Scale:** Governments and international organizations should provide financial and technical assistance to promote the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Community Engagement:** Engage local communities in the planning, implementation, and maintenance of these integrated solutions to ensure their acceptance and benefits.
3.  **Research Directions:**
    *   Economic impact analysis to determine cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.
    *   Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.

## Closing Outlook

Nature-based solutions like agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising approach to addressing landslide risk and ensuring water security in lower-income countries. By integrating water harvesting, storage, and efficient use with renewable energy sources, these systems can enhance climate resilience and support sustainable development.
