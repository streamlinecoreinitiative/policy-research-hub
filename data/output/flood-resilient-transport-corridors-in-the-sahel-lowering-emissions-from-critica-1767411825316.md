# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Sahel: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Sahel: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region is vulnerable to climate change, with frequent droughts and floods affecting transportation infrastructure and communities. This brief highlights the importance of flood-resilient transport corridors in the Sahel, focusing on lowering emissions from critical sectors such as water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity**

The Ethiopian Highlands experience significant precipitation variability (annual range of [verify] mm) with average annual rainfall between [verify] mm. Traditional irrigation methods result in substantial water loss due to evaporation and seepage. These inefficiencies exacerbate the region's severe water scarcity, impacting agriculture, energy production, and human consumption.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation methods are energy-intensive and economically burdensome. Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems lose significant amounts of water to evaporation and seepage. The cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods ranges from $[verify]-$[verify]/year.

**Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

• Soil organic matter: [verify]%
• Biodiversity increase: [verify]%
• Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

Case studies from similar regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in promoting climate resilience.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions. Key data points include:

• Power generation: [verify] kW per system
• Energy efficiency: [verify]%
• Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

**Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To create supportive policy environments for sustainable solutions, consider the following recommendations:

1. Incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans)
2. Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
3. Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research should focus on local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Needed Evidence Snippets**

1. NOAA Climate Dataset: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Ethiopia (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade)
2. Local Surveys and Case Studies: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
3. Long-Term Sustainability Assessments: Specific data on long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into irrigation practices offers a promising solution to address severe water scarcity in the Sahel region. By promoting sustainable development goals, we can lower emissions from critical sectors while enhancing climate resilience and community well-being.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct local surveys and case studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop supportive policy environments through incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans) and grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
3. Invest in infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities) to enhance the effectiveness of flood-resilient transport corridors.
