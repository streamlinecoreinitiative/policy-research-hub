# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Horn of Africa: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Enhancing Water Security and Renewable Energy Use**

Executive Summary:

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, with severe droughts and erratic rainfall patterns affecting agricultural production and food security. The school feeding program relies on these vulnerable supply chains, which are often disrupted by climate-related events. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in irrigation as a solution to enhance water security and renewable energy use.

**Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity in the Horn of Africa**

The region is characterized by arid and semi-arid conditions, making it highly susceptible to climate-related shocks. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have led to increased frequency and severity of droughts, affecting agricultural productivity and food security (UN Environment Programme).

* Key statistics:
	+ Average annual rainfall in the Horn of Africa: [verify]
	+ Number of people affected by droughts and famines in the region: [verify]

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods in the Horn of Africa are often energy-intensive and costly. These systems exacerbate poverty among smallholder farmers, who struggle to maintain them due to high operational costs (World Bank). Water loss through evaporation and seepage is a significant challenge.

* Case studies:
	+ Examples of communities affected by droughts and famines
	+ Analysis of water loss through evaporation and seepage

**Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration in the Horn of Africa. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use.

* Benefits:
	+ Improved water retention and reduced erosion
	+ Reduced reliance on diesel generators and increased energy efficiency

**Pilot Projects and Policy Recommendations**

Several pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in irrigation. These projects have shown significant reductions in water loss, improved crop yields, and enhanced energy efficiency.

* Key findings:
	+ Economic analysis showing cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up
	+ Case studies demonstrating community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support policy and regulatory frameworks**: Governments should develop policies and regulations to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale.
2. **Invest in research and development**: Further research is needed on the economic impact, community engagement, and scaling up of these integrated solutions.
3. **Engage with local communities**: Community-led initiatives and participatory approaches should be encouraged to ensure that these solutions meet local needs and priorities.

**Closing Outlook:**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Horn of Africa require innovative solutions that enhance water security and renewable energy use. Integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in irrigation can provide a sustainable solution that reduces disaster losses for vulnerable groups. By supporting policy and regulatory frameworks, investing in research and development, and engaging with local communities, we can build more resilient supply chains.

**Data Gaps:**

1. Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected regions in the Horn of Africa.
2. Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
