# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and vulnerable regions to climate change, with peri-urban households facing significant challenges in accessing clean energy and water. This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into irrigation practices to address severe water scarcity and poverty.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Growing Concern

### Water Security Challenges

*   Climate change is projected to exacerbate water scarcity, with the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta experiencing increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods. [verify]
*   Population growth and urbanization have led to increased demand for water, straining existing infrastructure and resources.

### Clean Energy Opportunities

*   Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can provide a reliable and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.
*   Micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for generating electricity in remote or off-grid areas.

### Climate Adaptation Strategies

*   Agroforestry practices can enhance soil fertility, improve water retention, and promote biodiversity.
*   Integrated approaches that combine agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a comprehensive solution to climate-related challenges.

## Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

### Policy Recommendations

1.  Governments should prioritize investments in renewable energy infrastructure, particularly micro-hydro systems, to support sustainable development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
2.  Financial institutions should offer preferential lending rates and terms for projects that integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems.
3.  International organizations should provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs to support the adoption of these integrated solutions.

### Future Research Directions

1.  Conducting a comprehensive assessment of the economic benefits and costs associated with implementing agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in peri-urban areas.
2.  Developing and disseminating best practices for integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance overall system efficiency and sustainability.
3.  Investigating the potential for scaling up these solutions through partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking in peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta requires a multifaceted approach that addresses water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges. By leveraging agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we can provide sustainable economic benefits, enhance resilience to climate-related shocks, and promote equitable access to resources for communities in lower-income countries.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  Governments should prioritize investments in renewable energy infrastructure.
2.  Financial institutions should offer preferential lending rates and terms for projects that integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems.
3.  International organizations should provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs to support the adoption of these integrated solutions.
