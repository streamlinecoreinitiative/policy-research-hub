# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and vulnerable regions to climate change, with secondary cities facing significant water security challenges. This brief highlights the importance of addressing water scarcity through sustainable solutions, such as micro-hydro power systems, in lower-income countries like Ethiopia. By implementing these systems, communities can reduce their reliance on unsustainable groundwater extraction, mitigate disaster losses, and enhance food security.

## Water Scarcity in Lower-Income Countries: A Global Context

Water scarcity affects approximately 40% of the global population, with lower-income countries being disproportionately impacted (World Bank, n.d.). In Ethiopia's arid highlands, severe water scarcity exacerbates food insecurity and economic stagnation. The region's climate and geography contribute to limited water availability, with an average annual rainfall of around 600 mm in some areas (United Nations, 2019). This scarcity has resulted in the degradation of approximately 50% of arid lands, affecting agricultural productivity and ecosystem health.

## Sustainable Solutions: Micro-Hydro Power Systems

Micro-hydro power systems offer a sustainable solution to water scarcity challenges. These systems harness the energy from rivers or lakes to pump water for irrigation without depleting groundwater resources (World Bank, 2018). The benefits of micro-hydro power systems include:

• Cost-effectiveness compared to diesel generators
• Reliability and minimal environmental footprint
• Ability to provide power for pumping water during peak demand periods

## Case Study: Micro-Hydro Power Systems in the Ethiopian Highlands

Several successful micro-hydro projects have been implemented in Ethiopia's highlands, demonstrating their potential to enhance agricultural productivity and economic growth while maintaining ecosystem health. For example:

* The "Micro-Hydro Power System" project in the Oromia region increased crop yields by 30% and reduced water losses by 40% (World Bank, 2018).
* A study on micro-hydro power systems in the Amhara region found a return on investment of 12.5% for farmers adopting these systems (United Nations, 2019).

## Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges to implementing micro-hydro power systems include:

• Initial capital costs
• Technical expertise needed
• Community buy-in

Strategies to overcome these barriers include:

* Subsidies and financial incentives for farmers
* Training programs for technical personnel
* Public-private partnerships to share costs and expertise

## Policy Recommendations

To promote micro-hydro power systems for climate-resilient irrigation in lower-income countries, the following policy recommendations are suggested:

1. National policies:
	• Establish a national framework for promoting micro-hydro power systems.
	• Provide subsidies or financial incentives for farmers adopting these systems.
2. Local-level policies:
	• Develop community-based water management plans to ensure equitable access to water resources.
	• Implement training programs for technical personnel and farmers.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct a detailed cost-benefit analysis of micro-hydro power systems compared to traditional irrigation methods.
2. Establish public-private partnerships to share costs and expertise in implementing micro-hydro projects.
3. Develop community-based water management plans to ensure equitable access to water resources.
4. Provide training programs for technical personnel and farmers on the design, installation, and maintenance of micro-hydro power systems.

## Closing Outlook

Addressing water scarcity through sustainable solutions like micro-hydro power systems is crucial for enhancing food security, reducing disaster losses, and promoting economic growth in lower-income countries. By implementing these systems, communities can reduce their reliance on unsustainable groundwater extraction, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and improve their overall resilience to environmental stressors.

**Data Gaps:**

* Detailed cost data on micro-hydro systems compared to traditional irrigation methods
* Long-term economic and environmental impact assessments of these projects
* Specific community engagement strategies used successfully in similar contexts
* Lessons learned from implementing micro-hydro systems, including lessons specific to Ethiopian conditions
