**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Horn of Africa: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

To address the severe water security challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in solar-powered desalination plants to provide clean drinking water to millions of people. This is a critical step towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 on clean water and sanitation. We also urge governments and development partners to strengthen renewable energy projects, particularly solar power, to improve electricity access and reliability across the region.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water security challenges, with only [VERIFY] 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This is a stark contrast to the global average of [VERIFY] 73.7% (World Bank Open Data). The limited electricity access in the region exacerbates these challenges by reducing opportunities for sustainable development and economic growth (World Bank Open Data).

Climate change intensifies droughts and floods, further straining already strained resources. According to the World Bank, Sub-Saharan Africa has only [VERIFY] 14.2% renewable energy consumption, falling far short of global averages (19.7%) (World Bank Open Data). This disparity underscores the need for increased investment and policy support to enhance renewable energy use.

## Analysis

The data is clear: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in water security and renewable energy consumption. The region's climate resilience is also a critical concern due to increasing frequency and intensity of droughts and floods (World Bank Open Data). These climatic shifts not only affect water security but also exacerbate existing challenges such as food insecurity and economic instability.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Solar-Powered Desalination Plants**: Implementing solar-powered desalination facilities can provide clean drinking water to millions of people who lack access, especially in arid regions.
2. **Strengthen Renewable Energy Projects**: Increase investment in renewable energy projects, particularly solar power, to improve electricity access and reliability across the region.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop and implement comprehensive climate adaptation plans that include early warning systems, water resource management strategies, and resilient infrastructure designs.

## Implementation Considerations

- Costs: Initial investments for desalination plants and renewable energy projects can be high but are offset by long-term benefits in terms of improved health outcomes and economic stability.
- Potential Barriers: Resistance from local populations to new technologies or policies may require community engagement and education. Additionally, securing adequate funding remains a challenge.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa requires strategic investments in renewable energy and desalination technology. By doing so, we can significantly enhance the lives of millions while fostering sustainable development that benefits current and future generations. Further research is needed to refine these strategies based on specific regional contexts and needs.
