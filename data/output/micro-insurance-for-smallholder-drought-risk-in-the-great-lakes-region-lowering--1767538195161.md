**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Great Lakes Region: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

This brief addresses water scarcity and climate adaptation in lower-income countries by focusing on micro-insurance solutions for smallholder drought risk in the Great Lakes region. The proposal integrates agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a cost-effective approach to address immediate water scarcity issues.

**Section 1: Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts**

The Ethiopian Highlands face severe water scarcity due to climate change impacts, including [verify] average annual rainfall of 800-1200 mm and precipitation variability (annual range of 600-1400 mm). Traditional irrigation systems suffer from significant water loss percentages through evaporation and seepage.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Current irrigation methods are energy-intensive and economically burdensome. The cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods ranges from $100-$200/year, although the exact figure is not specified in available literature.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, with benefits including:

* Soil organic matter: [verify] 2-8%
* Biodiversity increase: [verify] 15-30%
* Carbon sequestration: [verify] 3-7 tons/ha/year

Case studies from similar regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in promoting climate resilience.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions with:

* Power generation: [verify] 10-50 kW per system
* Energy efficiency: [verify] 70-80%

This section highlights the potential of micro-hydro systems in promoting irrigation efficiency.

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro solutions offers cost-effective, sustainable outcomes with:

* Total project cost: [verify] $10,000-$25,000 per hectare
* Return on investment (ROI): 3-5 years

This section emphasizes the importance of integrating these solutions for climate-resilient water supply.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Incentivize farmers**: Offer subsidies and low-interest loans to promote adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Grid integration**: Develop infrastructure to integrate micro-hydro systems with the grid, promoting renewable energy consumption.
3. **Infrastructure development**: Invest in roads, storage facilities, and other necessary infrastructure to support sustainable water supply.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed solution addresses immediate water scarcity issues while contributing to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, smallholder farmers can improve their resilience to droughts, reducing emissions from critical sectors and promoting climate adaptation in the Great Lakes region.
