# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**
To address the pressing issues of water scarcity, low electrification rates, and climate-related vulnerabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in water infrastructure, increasing renewable energy deployment, and implementing climate adaptation measures. This brief outlines actionable recommendations to enhance water security, clean energy use, and climate resilience.

**Context & Challenge**

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in achieving sustainable development due to inadequate access to safe drinking water [1] and electricity [2]. The region's renewable energy consumption is low at 19.7% [3], compared to the world average of 50%. Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, leading to increased droughts and floods that threaten water resources, agriculture, and economic stability.

**Analysis**

* **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa has a critical gap in access to safe drinking water (32.4%) [1], far below global standards (73.7% [4]). This disparity affects public health and economic productivity.
* **Clean Energy**: Despite progress, renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7% [3], compared to the world average of 50%.
* **Climate Adaptation**: Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, which threaten water resources, agriculture, and economic stability.

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**: Prioritize building and improving water supply systems, focusing on rural areas with limited access. Implement rainwater harvesting ponds and solar-powered wells where feasible.
2. **Increase Renewable Energy Deployment**: Encourage the use of renewable energy sources like solar power to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy security. Develop policies that incentivize private sector investment in clean energy projects.
3. **Implement Climate Adaptation Measures**: Invest in early warning systems, drought-resistant crops, and climate-resilient infrastructure such as flood barriers and water storage facilities.

**Implementation Considerations**

* **Costs**: Initial investments for water infrastructure and renewable energy will require substantial financial resources. However, long-term savings from reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity outweigh the initial costs.
* **Barriers**: Political instability and corruption can hinder implementation. Establish clear governance structures and ensure transparent decision-making processes to overcome these challenges.

**Conclusion**
Enhancing water security, clean energy use, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa is critical for sustainable development. By implementing the recommended policy measures, governments and stakeholders can improve living conditions and build resilience against future shocks. Immediate action is needed to address existing gaps and ensure a brighter future for all citizens.

### Background Information

**Environment**
Natural environment refers to all living and non-living things occurring naturally and the physical and biological factors along with their chemical interactions that impact on any organism or a group of organisms [8].

**Resilience**
Resilience is the capacity of an individual, community, or organization to withstand and recover from adversity, trauma, or stress [9].
