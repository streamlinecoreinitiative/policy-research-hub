**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa region is vulnerable to climate change impacts, including water scarcity and erratic rainfall patterns. This brief highlights the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a climate-resilient irrigation solution for cash crops.

**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Focus on Water Security**

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Horn of Africa, affecting agriculture, livelihoods, and food security. Traditional irrigation methods are often energy-intensive and costly, while micro-hydro systems offer a sustainable alternative. Agroforestry practices can improve soil health, reduce erosion, and enhance biodiversity.

**Key Components for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Horn of Africa**

*   **Agroforestry Benefits:**
    *   Improved soil structure and water retention capacity
    *   Enhanced biodiversity and natural pest control
    *   Reduced erosion and increased crop yields
*   **Micro-Hydro Systems:**
    *   Renewable energy source for irrigation systems
    *   Energy savings compared to traditional diesel generators

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

1.  **Subsidies and Grants:** Governments can provide subsidies, grants, or low-interest loans to support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Infrastructure Development:** Funding for infrastructure improvements is essential for facilitating the implementation of these solutions.

**Short Actions/Recommendations List:**

1.  Conduct a thorough assessment of climate data in the Horn of Africa region to inform policy decisions.
2.  Develop and implement cost-benefit analyses to evaluate the economic viability of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
3.  Establish community engagement strategies to promote education and awareness about the benefits of these integrated systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for climate-resilient irrigation in the Horn of Africa. By supporting policy changes, infrastructure development, and sustainable practices, we can enhance water security and improve agricultural productivity in vulnerable communities.
