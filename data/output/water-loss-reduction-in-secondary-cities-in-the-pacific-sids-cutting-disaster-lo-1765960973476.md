**Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Pacific SIDS: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are among the most vulnerable to climate-related disasters, particularly those related to water security and clean energy. This brief highlights the importance of implementing urban green roofs as a resilience-building measure in secondary cities across these regions. By reducing heat stress and enhancing livelihoods, green roofs can provide immediate cooling benefits while serving as a sustainable solution for water management.

**Climate Challenges and Urban Heat Stress in Pacific SIDS**

The Pacific SIDS are facing severe climate challenges, including rising temperatures, increased frequency of droughts, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. These conditions exacerbate urban heat stress, which disproportionately affects vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and low-income households. The prolonged heat exposure can lead to heat-related illnesses, reduced productivity, and increased mortality rates.

**Benefits and Mechanisms of Green Roofs**

Green roofs offer several benefits that address the climate challenges faced by Pacific SIDS:

* **Heat Island Mitigation**: Green roofs reduce the urban heat island effect by providing insulation, absorbing solar radiation, and releasing heat slowly.
* **Water Retention and Management**: Green roofs retain rainwater, reducing stormwater runoff and alleviating pressure on municipal water systems. They also provide a natural buffer against extreme weather events.

**Case Studies: Successful Implementations in Other Regions**

Successful green roof implementations have been documented in various regions:

* **Brazil**: The city of Rio de Janeiro has implemented extensive green roofs to mitigate heat stress, reduce energy consumption, and improve air quality.
* **Europe**: Cities such as Berlin and Copenhagen have incorporated green roofs into their urban planning strategies to address climate change and enhance livability.
* **North America**: Green roof installations in cities like Toronto and New York City have demonstrated significant reductions in energy consumption and stormwater runoff.

**Economic Impacts on Livelihoods**

Green roofs offer economic benefits that can improve livelihoods:

* **Cost Savings for Buildings**: Green roofs reduce energy consumption, lower cooling costs, and extend the lifespan of building materials.
* **Job Creation through Maintenance Services**: Regular maintenance and management services create job opportunities in secondary cities.

**Policy and Funding Support Needed**

To encourage widespread adoption of green roofs, governments, NGOs, and private sector initiatives should collaborate on:

* **Government Incentives**: Offer tax credits, rebates, or low-interest loans to encourage building owners to install green roofs.
* **Public-Private Partnerships**: Foster partnerships between local governments, NGOs, and private sector companies to develop and implement large-scale green roof projects.

**Data Points Needed:**

To better understand the effectiveness of green roofs in Pacific SIDS, the following data points are required:

* Average temperature reduction achieved by green roof installations in Sahel cities
* Cost per square meter of implementing a green roof system
* Number of jobs created annually through maintenance services

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of climate-related risks and vulnerabilities in Pacific SIDS.
2. Develop and implement policies to encourage the adoption of green roofs, including incentives for building owners and developers.
3. Establish public-private partnerships to develop large-scale green roof projects.
4. Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of green roof installations in reducing heat stress and enhancing livelihoods.

**Closing Outlook**

Implementing urban green roofs is a critical step towards enhancing resilience and reducing disaster losses in Pacific SIDS. By addressing climate-related challenges, improving water security, and creating jobs through maintenance services, green roofs can contribute to more livable and sustainable secondary cities.
