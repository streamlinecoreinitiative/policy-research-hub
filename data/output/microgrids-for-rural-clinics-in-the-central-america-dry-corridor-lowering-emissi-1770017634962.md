**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Central America Dry Corridor: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to invest in renewable energy and climate adaptation measures in the Central America dry corridor, where rural clinics face significant challenges in providing critical services due to unreliable electricity supply. We recommend establishing microgrids powered by solar energy to ensure 24/7 electricity access for these healthcare facilities. This intervention will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also improve healthcare outcomes and resilience against climate-related shocks.

## Context & Challenge

The Central America dry corridor is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world, facing severe droughts and water scarcity due to climate change [1]. Rural clinics in this region struggle to provide essential services, including medical care, due to frequent power outages and unreliable electricity supply [2]. According to World Bank data, only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, compared to 91.6% globally [3].

## Analysis

Climate change is projected to exacerbate water scarcity and extreme weather events in the region, further compromising healthcare services [4]. Renewable energy can play a crucial role in addressing these challenges by providing reliable and sustainable power for rural clinics. A study on microgrid implementation in similar contexts has shown significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and improved energy access [5].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Microgrids for Rural Clinics**: Develop policies to support the installation of solar-powered microgrids in rural clinics, ensuring 24/7 electricity access.
2. **Promote Energy Efficiency Measures**: Implement energy-efficient practices and technologies in healthcare facilities to reduce energy consumption and emissions.
3. **Support Climate-Resilient Agriculture**: Encourage farmers to adopt climate-resilient agricultural practices, reducing pressure on water resources and improving food security.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments will require significant financial support from both domestic budgets and international donors [6]. However, long-term savings can be realized through reduced healthcare costs related to energy access and improved agricultural productivity. Potential barriers include limited infrastructure and initial high costs; targeted training programs, public-private partnerships, and phased implementation strategies can help address these challenges.

## Conclusion

The Central America dry corridor is facing unprecedented climate-related challenges that compromise rural clinics' ability to provide critical services. Investing in renewable energy and climate adaptation measures, particularly microgrids for rural clinics, is essential to reduce emissions, improve healthcare outcomes, and enhance resilience against climate shocks. We urge governments, NGOs, and international development organizations to prioritize these interventions, ensuring timely and effective implementation.
