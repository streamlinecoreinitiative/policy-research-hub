# Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Horn of Africa: Enhancing Food Security during Droughts

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa faces severe droughts, affecting food security and livelihoods of communities reliant on fishing and aquaculture. Traditional cold-chain systems rely heavily on diesel generators, exacerbating energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions. This brief explores the potential of solar-powered cold-chain solutions for fisheries in the region, integrating renewable energy with efficient cooling technologies to stabilize food supply chains during droughts.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

### Introduction to Water Scarcity

The Horn of Africa is characterized by arid and semi-arid conditions, making water scarcity a pressing concern. Climate change has exacerbated this issue through increased evaporation from vast wetlands and erratic rainfall patterns.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the region include boreholes and canals, which often rely on diesel generators for pumping water. These systems suffer from high energy costs and limited scalability. The lack of efficient irrigation methods hampers agricultural productivity and food security, particularly during droughts when rainfall is scarce.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into farming systems, agroforestry enhances water retention, reduces erosion, and promotes more efficient use of water resources. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving crop yields.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution for irrigation, harnessing the power of small-scale hydroelectric systems to reduce reliance on diesel generators. These systems are energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential of combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to create climate-resilient irrigation solutions. These integrated approaches improve water efficiency and promote sustainable land-use practices, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
