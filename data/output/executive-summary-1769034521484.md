# Executive Summary

**Ensuring Accessible Clean Water, Sustainable Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing needs of Sub-Saharan Africa's population, we recommend investing $50-$100 per household in pipeline networks to enhance water supply infrastructure in rural areas where piped water access is not feasible. This investment will improve access to safely managed drinking water from 32.4% (World Bank, 2024) [1] to at least 60%. Additionally, increase subsidies for small-scale renewable energy projects like solar home systems and micro-hydro plants, particularly in off-grid regions. These interventions will enhance climate resilience by reducing the impacts of droughts and floods.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally when it comes to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation (World Bank, 2024) [1]. Despite significant progress in some areas like electricity access, millions remain without safe drinking water or reliable power. The region faces unprecedented challenges such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change.

According to the World Bank (2024), approximately 79 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to safely managed drinking water, with only 32.4% having access to this basic need [1]. Climate change intensifies these challenges with increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.

## Analysis

The region's energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions (19.7%) despite growing interest in renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power (World Bank, 2020) [2]. Renewable energy consumption rose from 10% in 2010 to 19.7% in 2020, indicating progress but still inadequate for addressing current needs.

Water scarcity is exacerbated by unsustainable practices such as over-extraction of groundwater and poor infrastructure maintenance. Climate change impacts increase water variability, leading to periodic shortages or floods that disrupt supply chains and livelihoods (World Bank, 2024) [1].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Supply Infrastructure**: Invest in pipeline networks for rural areas where piped water access is not feasible. Implement cost-sharing models with communities or grants to improve maintenance.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration**: Increase subsidies for small-scale renewable energy projects like solar home systems and micro-hydro plants, particularly in off-grid regions.
3. **Climate Resilient Water Management**: Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods, integrate climate-resilient agricultural practices, and prioritize water infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Calculations**: Cost estimates for pipeline networks range from $50 to $100 per household depending on the distance to existing sources. Subsidies or grants could reduce costs by up to 30% [VERIFY].
- **Barriers and Mitigation**: Community engagement is crucial; involve local leaders in planning and decision-making processes. Provide training and resources for maintenance and operation.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's urgent need for accessible clean water, sustainable energy, and climate resilience cannot be overstated. By implementing targeted policies and interventions, governments can improve living conditions and foster economic growth while mitigating future risks from climate change.

**Call to Action**: Encourage policymakers to prioritize investment in water infrastructure and renewable energy projects that are cost-effective and community-driven. Engage with stakeholders including NGOs, local authorities, and private sector entities to ensure widespread adoption and sustainability.
