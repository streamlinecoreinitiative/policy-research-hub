**Investing in Climate-Resilient Water Harvesting Systems to Mitigate Droughts in the Horn of Africa**

**Executive Summary:**
The Horn of Africa is one of the most drought-prone regions globally, facing severe water scarcity that exacerbates poverty and threatens livelihoods. A robust climate-resilient water harvesting system could significantly improve resilience in rural communities. This brief examines the feasibility of investing in such systems to mitigate drought-induced water scarcity.

**Introduction to Drought Vulnerability in the Horn of Africa**

The Horn of Africa, comprising countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti, is characterized by arid landscapes and seasonal rainfall patterns. Historical drought occurrences have had devastating impacts on agriculture, livestock, and water resources. For instance:

• **Drought frequency:** The region experiences frequent droughts, with some areas experiencing drought conditions up to 70% of the time.
• **Impact on agriculture:** Droughts lead to crop failures, reduced yields, and decreased agricultural productivity, exacerbating food insecurity.
• **Livestock and water resources:** Droughts also affect livestock production, as water sources dry up, further straining already scarce resources.

**Current Water Harvesting Technologies and Feasibility Study for New Systems**

Existing water harvesting technologies in the region include traditional ponds, dams, and check dams. However, these methods have limitations:

• **Traditional ponds:** Often prone to sedimentation, contamination, and evaporation.
• **Dams:** Can be expensive to build and maintain, with potential environmental impacts.
• **Check dams:** May not effectively capture or store water in areas with intense rainfall events.

A comparative study of different systems in other arid regions suggests that:

• **Percolation tanks:** Could be an effective solution for storing rainwater, reducing evaporation, and increasing water availability.
• **Rainwater harvesting systems:** Can provide a reliable source of clean water, especially during dry seasons.

**Economic Assessment and Funding Mechanisms**

Implementing new climate-resilient water harvesting infrastructure requires significant investment. A cost-benefit analysis suggests that:

• **Implementation costs:** Estimated to be between $100-$500 per household for small-scale systems.
• **Long-term benefits:** Potential economic impacts on agriculture and livestock productivity, as well as improved health outcomes due to increased access to clean water.

Potential funding sources include international aid, government grants, and private sector investments. International organizations like the UNDP, World Bank, and regional development banks can facilitate such investments by providing technical assistance, capacity building, and financial support.

**Community Engagement and Capacity Building**

Involving local communities in the design and maintenance of water systems is crucial for long-term sustainability:

• **Education and training:** Programs should focus on community ownership, maintenance, and repair.
• **Community-led initiatives:** Encourage local participation in planning, implementation, and decision-making processes.

**Policy Recommendations for Long-Term Sustainability**

National policies can support climate-resilient water management practices by:

• **Promoting decentralized systems:** Encouraging small-scale, community-based water harvesting infrastructure.
• **Providing incentives:** Offering subsidies or grants for implementing new technologies.
• **Strengthening institutional capacity:** Enhancing the ability of local governments to plan, implement, and maintain water systems.

International organizations can facilitate investments by:

• **Providing technical assistance:** Supporting the development of climate-resilient water harvesting infrastructure.
• **Offering financial support:** Providing grants or loans for implementing new technologies.
• **Facilitating knowledge sharing:** Promoting best practices and lessons learned from similar projects elsewhere.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct a detailed climate projections study to inform investment decisions.
2. Engage with local communities to build ownership and capacity for water harvesting infrastructure maintenance.
3. Develop national policies that support decentralized, community-based water management systems.
4. Provide incentives for implementing new technologies through government grants or subsidies.

**Closing Outlook:**
Investing in climate-resilient water harvesting systems can significantly improve resilience in rural communities of the Horn of Africa. By addressing data gaps and engaging with local stakeholders, we can develop effective solutions to mitigate drought-induced water scarcity and promote sustainable development.
