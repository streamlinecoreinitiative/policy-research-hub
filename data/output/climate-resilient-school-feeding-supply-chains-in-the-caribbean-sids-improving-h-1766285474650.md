# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Caribbean SIDS: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Caribbean, exacerbating water scarcity and affecting crop yields. School feeding programs are critical for ensuring children's access to nutritious meals, but these initiatives often rely on vulnerable supply chains.

## Climate-Resilient Water Supply Chains

The Caribbean SIDS face severe water scarcity due to climate change-induced droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

*   **Agroforestry's Role:** Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, reducing erosion and increasing water retention.
*   **Micro-Hydro Systems:** Micro-hydro technology enables efficient energy generation from small-scale hydroelectric systems, reducing reliance on diesel generators and promoting energy independence.

## Climate-Resilient Energy Supply Chains

The Caribbean SIDS rely heavily on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Transitioning to clean energy sources is essential for mitigating climate change impacts.

*   **Renewable Energy:** Renewable energy consumption has increased globally, but specific data for the Caribbean SIDS is needed.
*   **Micro-Hydro Systems:** Micro-hydro technology can provide reliable and efficient energy generation, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting energy independence.

## Climate Adaptation and Resilience

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security in the Caribbean SIDS. School feeding programs are critical for ensuring children's access to nutritious meals, but these initiatives often rely on vulnerable supply chains. Climate-resilient practices can help mitigate climate change impacts on school feeding supply chains.

*   **Water Security:** Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation.
*   **Clean Energy:** Transitioning to clean energy sources is essential for mitigating climate change impacts.
*   **Climate Adaptation:** Climate-resilient practices can help mitigate climate change impacts on school feeding supply chains.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Integrate Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems:** Pilot projects should demonstrate the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.
2.  **Promote Renewable Energy:** Transitioning to clean energy sources is essential for mitigating climate change impacts.
3.  **Support Climate Adaptation:** Climate-resilient practices can help mitigate climate change impacts on school feeding supply chains.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are critical for ensuring children's access to nutritious meals in the Caribbean SIDS. Integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, promoting renewable energy, and supporting climate adaptation efforts can help mitigate climate change impacts on food security.
