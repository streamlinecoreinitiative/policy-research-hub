**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Mekong Basin: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant challenges to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries. This brief focuses on peri-urban households in the Mekong basin, where a transition towards cleaner cooking practices can contribute to achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

**Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mekong Basin**

The Mekong basin is home to over 60 million people, with a significant portion living in peri-urban areas. Climate change has led to increased frequency and severity of droughts, affecting agricultural production and food security.

*   **Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture:** Temperature increases lead to reduced crop yields, while changes in precipitation patterns result in droughts or floods.
*   **Importance of Sustainable Irrigation Methods:** Efficient irrigation systems can help mitigate these impacts and ensure food security.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation methods in the Mekong basin include boreholes, canals, and traditional water harvesting techniques. However, these systems often suffer from high water loss through evaporation and seepage.

*   **Water Loss Through Evaporation:** [Verify] % of water is lost due to evaporation from open channels.
*   **Seepage in Canals:** Significant amounts of water are also lost through seepage into the surrounding soil.

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems combine trees with crops or livestock, promoting soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. These benefits can improve water retention and reduce erosion.

*   **Soil Health:** Agroforestry improves soil structure, increasing its capacity to retain water.
*   **Biodiversity:** Diverse tree species help maintain ecosystem services, including pollination and pest control.
*   **Carbon Sequestration:** Trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, contributing to climate change mitigation.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology involves small-scale hydroelectric systems that harness energy from water flow. These systems can provide clean energy for irrigation pumps, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

*   **Reduced Reliance on Diesel Generators:** Micro-hydro systems eliminate the need for polluting diesel generators.
*   **Increased Energy Efficiency:** Clean energy reduces energy losses associated with traditional power sources.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Pilot projects demonstrate the potential of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. Economic analyses show that these integrated solutions can be cost-effective and scalable.

*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Agroforestry-micro-hydro projects offer a viable alternative to traditional irrigation methods.
*   **Scalability:** Successful pilot projects can inform policy decisions, supporting wider adoption of these systems.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the transition towards cleaner cooking practices in peri-urban households, policymakers should:

1.  Develop policies promoting agroforestry-micro-hydro integration for irrigation.
2.  Provide incentives for community-led initiatives to adopt these integrated solutions.
3.  Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data.

**Closing Outlook**

The transition towards cleaner cooking practices in peri-urban households can contribute significantly to achieving NDCs under the Paris Agreement. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for irrigation, communities can enhance water security and reduce poverty among smallholder farmers. Policymakers should prioritize policy development, community engagement, and further research to support the widespread adoption of these integrated solutions.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Develop policies promoting agroforestry-micro-hydro integration.
2.  Provide incentives for community-led initiatives.
3.  Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data.

**Data Gaps:**

*   Long-term climate data specifically relevant to the highland regions in question.
*   Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
*   Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
