**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region is vulnerable to climate change impacts, including sea level rise, increased storm intensity, and altered precipitation patterns. Mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance can play a crucial role in supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by enhancing environmental resilience, promoting sustainable livelihoods, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This brief provides an overview of the potential for mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance to contribute to climate change adaptation efforts in the Great Lakes region.

**Environmental Resilience and Climate Change Adaptation in the Great Lakes Region**

The Great Lakes region is home to over 40 million people and is a critical ecosystem that supports biodiversity, fisheries, and tourism. However, climate change poses significant threats to this region's environmental resilience, including:

* Sea level rise: projected to increase by up to 1 meter by 2100
* Increased storm intensity: leading to more frequent and severe flooding events
* Altered precipitation patterns: affecting water quality, quantity, and ecosystem health

To address these challenges, the region's NDCs emphasize the need for climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable land use practices, and ecosystem-based adaptation. Mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance can contribute to these efforts by:

* Enhancing coastal resilience through natural barriers
* Promoting sustainable livelihoods through eco-tourism and fisheries management
* Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration

**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance: Opportunities and Challenges**

Several initiatives are underway in the Great Lakes region to promote mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance, including:

* The **Great Lakes Restoration Initiative**, which supports wetland restoration and conservation efforts
* The **Blue Carbon Fund**, a global initiative that provides financing for coastal ecosystem restoration and conservation projects

However, challenges remain, including:

* Limited funding and resources for large-scale mangrove restoration efforts
* Regulatory frameworks that may hinder the adoption of blue carbon finance mechanisms
* Lack of data on the economic benefits and climate change mitigation potential of mangrove ecosystems in the Great Lakes region

**Actions/Recommendations**

To support the implementation of mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives in the Great Lakes region, we recommend:

1. **Increased funding and resources**: for large-scale mangrove restoration efforts and blue carbon finance mechanisms
2. **Strengthened regulatory frameworks**: to facilitate the adoption of blue carbon finance mechanisms and promote sustainable land use practices
3. **Data collection and analysis**: to better understand the economic benefits and climate change mitigation potential of mangrove ecosystems in the Great Lakes region

**Closing Outlook**

Mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance have significant potential to support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs in the Great Lakes region. By addressing the challenges and opportunities outlined above, we can enhance environmental resilience, promote sustainable livelihoods, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this critical ecosystem.
