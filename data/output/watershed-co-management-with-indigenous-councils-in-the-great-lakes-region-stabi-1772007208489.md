**Bridging Gaps for Sustainable Development: Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant development challenges, including limited access to electricity ([VERIFY] 53.3% of the population) and safely managed drinking water (73.7% global coverage [1]). To address these gaps, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy projects, expanding water infrastructure, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies. Governments should allocate more funding towards clean energy and water security initiatives, with a focus on rural areas where access is most limited.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to nearly half of the world's population lacking safe water (2.2 billion people [2]). The region struggles with severe water scarcity, electricity shortages, and increasing climate vulnerability. Despite global renewable energy consumption reaching 19.7% in 2020 [3], Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in this area.

## Analysis

The global temperature rise since pre-industrial levels is +1.1°C [4], with significant climate impacts such as droughts and floods affecting the region. Climate finance needs for developing countries are estimated at $5.8-5.9 trillion annually by 2030 [5]. Progress towards SDG 6 targets, including access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities, remains slow.

## Policy Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Increase Investment in Renewable Energy Projects

* Develop a national renewable energy plan with targets for 30% of power generation from renewables by 2030.
* Allocate [NEEDS SOURCE] annually for solar projects and [NEEDS SOURCE] for wind turbines, with potential subsidies to make them more affordable.

### Recommendation 2: Expand Water Infrastructure

* Build at least one desalination plant per country with a capacity of 50,000 m³/day by 2030.
* Invest approximately $10 billion over the next decade, including construction and maintenance costs [6].

### Recommendation 3: Enhance Climate Adaptation Strategies

* Establish a regional climate information system that provides timely data on weather patterns and potential impacts.
* Allocate estimated costs of $50 million annually for monitoring systems and research initiatives [7].

## Implementation Considerations

To implement these recommendations, governments should:

* Monitor progress against SDG 6 targets
* Allocate dedicated budgets within national budgets for renewable energy projects and climate adaptation measures
* Collaborate with international partners to secure additional funding and expertise

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize investments in clean energy and water security to meet its SDG 6 targets. By adopting these recommendations, the region can lay a strong foundation for sustainable development while enhancing resilience against climate change impacts.
