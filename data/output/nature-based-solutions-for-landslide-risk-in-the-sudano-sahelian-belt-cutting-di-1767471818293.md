# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Enhancing Climate Resilience**

Executive Summary:

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to landslides, posing significant risks to communities and ecosystems. Climate change exacerbates these risks by altering precipitation patterns and increasing extreme weather events. This brief outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing landslide risk through nature-based solutions, focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries.

**Section 1: Understanding the Challenge**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is characterized by high precipitation variability (annual range of [verify] mm), leading to frequent landslides. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and economically burdensome, with borehole pumps consuming [verify] kWh/day and canal systems experiencing water loss due to evaporation and seepage.

**Section 2: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

• Soil organic matter: [verify]% increase
• Biodiversity increase: [verify]%
• Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

Case studies from similar regions (e.g., West Africa, East Africa) demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving climate resilience.

**Section 3: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions. Key data points include:

• Power generation: [verify] kW per system
• Energy efficiency: [verify]%
• Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a cost-effective, sustainable solution for climate-resilient water supply.

**Section 4: Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To create supportive policy environments for sustainable solutions:

• Incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans)
• Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
• Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research directions include long-term sustainability assessments and local surveys to evaluate community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct a thorough assessment of landslide risk in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.
2. Develop and implement policy recommendations for incentives, grid integration, and infrastructure development.
3. Establish partnerships with local communities, organizations, and governments to promote nature-based solutions.
4. Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook:**

The proposed approach addresses immediate water scarcity issues and contributes to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption. By integrating nature-based solutions, we can reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups and promote climate resilience in lower-income countries.
