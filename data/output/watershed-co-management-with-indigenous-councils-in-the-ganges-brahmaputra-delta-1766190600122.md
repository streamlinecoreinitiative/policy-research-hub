# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Watershed Co-management in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

Executive Summary:

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a densely populated and ecologically sensitive region in South Asia, facing severe climate-related challenges. Rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources threaten the livelihoods of millions of people living in this region. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a critical component of supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

**Climate Change Impacts on Water Security in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical agricultural region, supporting the livelihoods of millions of people. Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in this region through increased evaporation from highland wetlands and erratic rainfall patterns. Rising temperatures are also altering the timing and duration of the monsoon season, further reducing crop yields and affecting food security.

Key statistics:

* [Verify] Average annual rainfall in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta has decreased over the past three decades (data from NOAA climate dataset).
* Saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources is expected to increase due to sea-level rise (IPCC projections).

**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils: A Key Component of Climate Resilience**

Indigenous councils have traditionally managed watersheds in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, ensuring that water resources are shared equitably among communities. Engaging indigenous councils in decision-making processes can help ensure that climate-resilient strategies are tailored to local needs and contexts.

Benefits of watershed co-management with indigenous councils:

* Improved water security through community-led conservation efforts.
* Enhanced biodiversity through agroforestry practices and habitat restoration.
* Increased carbon sequestration through reforestation and afforestation initiatives.

**Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta has significant potential for renewable energy generation, particularly solar and wind power. Integrating clean energy with climate adaptation strategies can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving water security.

Key statistics:

* The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta has an estimated [verify] GW of untapped solar energy potential (World Bank report).
* Renewable energy adoption in Africa is expected to increase by [verify]% by 2030 (World Bank projections).

**Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support adaptation targets in NDCs, we recommend the following:

1. **Strengthen community engagement**: Engage indigenous councils in decision-making processes to ensure that climate-resilient strategies are tailored to local needs.
2. **Integrate clean energy with climate adaptation**: Promote renewable energy generation and integration with climate adaptation initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
3. **Support watershed co-management**: Provide technical and financial support for community-led conservation efforts to improve water security.

Future research directions:

* Conduct socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated solutions.
* Develop detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
* Investigate the potential for scaling up watershed co-management initiatives across the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
