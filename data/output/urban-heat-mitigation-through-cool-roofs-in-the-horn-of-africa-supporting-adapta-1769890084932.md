**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Call for Action**

## Executive Summary

To address the critical challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $10 billion in infrastructure to improve water supply and sanitation over the next five years. This investment will help increase access to safely managed drinking water from 32.4% to at least [VERIFY]%, reducing water scarcity episodes by half. Additionally, we propose promoting decentralized renewable energy solutions such as solar home systems and microgrids, with a goal of increasing renewable energy consumption to [VERIFY]% by 2030.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to water scarcity, power outages, and extreme weather events due to its geography, economy, and governance. The region has the lowest rates of safe drinking water access (32.4%) and electricity access (53.3%), impacting health outcomes and economic productivity. According to World Bank data, around [NEEDS SOURCE] million people are affected by desertification annually, while climate models predict increased rainfall variability, leading to more frequent water scarcity episodes.

## Analysis

Recent data from the World Bank highlights substantial disparities in access to safe drinking water and electricity. The region lags behind globally in these critical areas. Water scarcity affects approximately [NEEDS SOURCE]% of the population (2.2 billion people), while only about half have reliable access to electricity. These issues are compounded by climate change, causing more frequent droughts and floods.

According to World Bank Open Data, access to safely managed drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa is at 32.4%, compared to [VERIFY]% globally (World Bank, 2024). Similarly, access to electricity in the region stands at 53.3%, far behind the global average of [VERIFY]% (World Bank, 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Improve Water Security**:
	* Invest $2 billion in water infrastructure such as wells, dams, and pipelines.
	* Promote rainwater harvesting and water-efficient technologies.
2. **Increase Clean Energy Access**:
	* Implement subsidies for solar home systems and microgrids.
	* Develop community-based renewable energy projects.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**:
	* Strengthen early warning systems for climate-related disasters.
	* Support crop diversification and agroforestry practices.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure successful implementation, we recommend:

1. Funding: Secure dedicated budgets from national governments and international donors.
2. Partnerships: Collaborate with NGOs, private sector companies, and local communities.
3. Monitoring & Evaluation: Establish clear indicators to track progress and adapt strategies as needed.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is essential for achieving the SDGs and fostering sustainable development. By adopting evidence-based policies and engaging stakeholders, governments can make significant strides towards a more resilient future.
