# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

The Andean highlands face significant environmental challenges due to climate change, including water scarcity and pollution from traditional cooking methods. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for peri-urban households in this region, focusing on safeguarding freshwater ecosystems.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change has severe impacts on agriculture in the Andean highlands, exacerbating water scarcity due to erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from wetlands. Traditional irrigation methods are often energy-intensive and costly, straining economic resources for smallholder farmers in vulnerable communities.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Andean highlands include boreholes and canals, which suffer from significant water loss through evaporation and seepage. Economic analysis reveals the high costs associated with these traditional methods, making it challenging for smallholder farmers to maintain their livelihoods.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry systems enhance water retention and reduce erosion, making them an attractive solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a viable alternative to traditional energy sources, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency. Economic analysis indicates cost savings compared to conventional irrigation methods.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have successfully integrated agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, demonstrating the potential for scale-up. Economic analysis highlights the cost-effectiveness of these combined solutions.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems at scale:

1.  **Subsidies:** Provide financial incentives to peri-urban households for adopting sustainable irrigation methods.
2.  **Low-Interest Loans:** Offer low-interest loans for smallholder farmers to invest in micro-hydro systems and agroforestry practices.
3.  **Infrastructure Development:** Invest in infrastructure development, including canals, reservoirs, and energy storage facilities.

## Future Research Directions

To further validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems:

1.  **Long-Term Sustainability Assessments:** Conduct long-term assessments to evaluate the sustainability of these combined solutions.
2.  **Community Engagement Strategies:** Develop effective community engagement strategies to promote adoption and ensure the long-term success of these initiatives.

## Actions/Recommendations

To address water scarcity, clean energy, and climate adaptation in peri-urban households of the Andean highlands:

1.  **Develop and Implement Integrated Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Systems:** Collaborate with local stakeholders to develop and implement integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Provide Training and Capacity Building:** Offer training and capacity-building programs for smallholder farmers on sustainable irrigation methods and micro-hydro system maintenance.
3.  **Establish Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks:** Develop monitoring and evaluation frameworks to track the impact of these initiatives.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems holds great promise for peri-urban households in the Andean highlands, addressing pressing environmental challenges while promoting sustainable development. By adopting this solution, communities can safeguard freshwater ecosystems, enhance water security, and contribute to a cleaner energy future.
