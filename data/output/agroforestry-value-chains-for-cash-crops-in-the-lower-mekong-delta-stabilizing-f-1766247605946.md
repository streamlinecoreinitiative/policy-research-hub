**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Lower Mekong Delta: Enhancing Climate Resilience and Food Security**

### Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta faces severe water scarcity due to climate change, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns. Traditional irrigation methods exacerbate poverty among smallholder farmers. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use.

### Current Challenges in the Lower Mekong Delta

The region relies heavily on traditional irrigation methods, which are often inefficient and energy-intensive. Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity issues, with erratic rainfall patterns and increased temperatures reducing crop yields. [Verify] specific water loss percentages from existing irrigation systems.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion, increase water retention, and promote resource efficiency. Case studies demonstrate that agroforestry systems can improve crop yields.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for irrigation efficiency in the Lower Mekong delta. Small-scale hydroelectric systems can provide renewable energy for pumping, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency. [Verify] pilot project results demonstrating reduced water loss through evaporation and seepage.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a comprehensive solution for climate-resilient irrigation. Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential for integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems to improve water security, increase crop yields, and promote sustainable livelihoods among smallholder farmers.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale, we recommend:

* Developing policies that incentivize the use of renewable energy for irrigation
* Providing technical assistance and capacity-building programs for smallholder farmers
* Conducting further research on the economic impact and community acceptance of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
