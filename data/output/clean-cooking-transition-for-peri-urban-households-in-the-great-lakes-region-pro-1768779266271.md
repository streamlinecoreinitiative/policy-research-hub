# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Great Lakes Region: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region faces severe water scarcity and climate change impacts, threatening peri-urban households' livelihoods. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems to address these challenges through integrated approaches.

## Addressing Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts

### Introduction to Water Scarcity

Water scarcity is a pressing issue in the Great Lakes region, affecting agriculture, industry, and households. Agroforestry projects have demonstrated benefits, including increased soil moisture retention [verify] and reduced canal losses [verify]. However, current irrigation practices face challenges such as high labor costs and diesel generator maintenance costs.

### Agroforestry's Role

Agroforestry plays a crucial role in addressing water scarcity and climate change impacts. Soil health benefits include:

* Increased soil moisture retention [verify]
* Higher crop yields due to agroforestry practices [verify]
* Improved biodiversity leading to natural pest control and pollination services

Biodiversity enhancement is also a key benefit of agroforestry, with improved ecosystem services contributing to:

* Natural pest control and pollination services
* Reduced reliance on chemical inputs

### Micro-Hydro Systems

Micro-hydro technology offers a renewable energy source for irrigation systems, reducing diesel generator usage [verify]. The use of micro-hydro systems has been shown to improve water delivery in pilot projects.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies demonstrates benefits:

* Increased crop yields due to self-sufficient renewable energy supply
* Savings from reduced fuel and maintenance costs [verify]

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, policy recommendations include:

* Subsidies and grants: Government subsidies for micro-hydro system installation
* Infrastructure development: Community-led micro-hydro system installations with local government support

## Future Research Directions

To ensure the long-term sustainability of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems:

* Long-term sustainability assessments: 5-year monitoring period to ensure long-term benefits from integrated systems
* Community engagement strategies: Participatory decision-making processes and joint decision-making committees involving farmers, government officials, and environmental experts

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Implement policy incentives**: Governments should provide subsidies and grants for the installation of micro-hydro systems.
2. **Support community engagement**: Local governments should facilitate participatory decision-making processes and joint decision-making committees.
3. **Conduct long-term sustainability assessments**: Monitor integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems over a 5-year period to ensure long-term benefits.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for addressing water scarcity and climate change impacts in the Great Lakes region. To ensure the adoption of these integrated approaches, policy incentives, community engagement strategies, and long-term sustainability assessments are essential.
