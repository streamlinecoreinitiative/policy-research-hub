# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Pacific SIDS: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in Pacific Small Island Developing States: Enhancing Food Security and Economic Stability**

**Executive Summary**

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including frequent natural disasters and water scarcity, which affect food security and economic stability. This brief highlights the importance of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in these countries, focusing on integrated agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a potential solution.

**Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity**

The Pacific SIDS are susceptible to climate-related disasters, including cyclones, droughts, and sea-level rise. These events exacerbate existing water scarcity issues, affecting agriculture, food security, and economic stability. The region's reliance on rain-fed irrigation systems increases vulnerability to erratic rainfall patterns.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Pacific SIDS often rely on boreholes or canals, which are prone to water loss through evaporation and seepage. These methods contribute to soil erosion and decreased crop yields.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address severe water scarcity in the Pacific SIDS. By integrating agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric systems, these regions can:

• Improve soil health and biodiversity
• Enhance water retention and reduce erosion
• Increase energy efficiency

**Policy Recommendations**

To support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Pacific SIDS, we recommend:

• Subsidies for agroforestry-based micro-hydro system implementation [verify]
• Low-interest loans for infrastructure development
• Capacity-building programs for farmers and communities on integrated agroforestry practices

**Future Research Directions**

Additional studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in Pacific SIDS. Key areas for further research include:

• Long-term sustainability assessments [verify]
• Community engagement strategies
• Economic analysis of cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support policy development:** Encourage governments to adopt policies supporting the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains.
2. **Capacity-building programs:** Develop training programs for farmers, communities, and policymakers on integrated agroforestry practices.
3. **Infrastructure development:** Invest in infrastructure development, including low-interest loans for agroforestry-based micro-hydro system implementation.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are critical to ensuring the food security and economic stability of Pacific SIDS. By integrating agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric systems, these regions can reduce disaster losses and promote sustainable development. We recommend policy support, capacity-building programs, and infrastructure development to facilitate the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Pacific SIDS.
