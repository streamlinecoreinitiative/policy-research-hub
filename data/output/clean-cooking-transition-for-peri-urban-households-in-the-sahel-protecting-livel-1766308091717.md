# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sahel: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Sahel region faces significant climate-related challenges, including droughts and erratic rainfall patterns, which severely impact peri-urban households' access to clean cooking energy. Traditional biomass fuels are often used, leading to indoor air pollution and health issues. This brief highlights the importance of transitioning to cleaner cooking methods, focusing on the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation and renewable energy use.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sahel

The Sahel region is characterized by a semi-arid climate with low rainfall patterns, making it vulnerable to droughts and water scarcity. Climate change exacerbates these conditions, leading to decreased crop yields, reduced livestock productivity, and increased poverty levels among peri-urban households.

### Key Statistics

*   The Sahel region experiences a decrease in rainfall between 1980 and 2015 (Source: [1])
*   Over 50% of the population in the Sahel relies on biomass fuels for cooking (Source: [2])

## Current Cooking Practices and Challenges

Peri-urban households in the Sahel primarily use traditional biomass fuels, such as charcoal and firewood, for cooking. These methods are often inefficient, leading to indoor air pollution and health issues.

### Key Statistics

*   Indoor air pollution from biomass fuels results in a significant number of premature deaths annually (Source: [3])
*   Biomass fuel collection accounts for up to 50% of women's daily workload in the Sahel region (Source: [4])

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation and renewable energy use. These systems integrate agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric power generation, providing a reliable source of clean cooking energy.

### Key Benefits

*   Reduced reliance on biomass fuels
*   Improved water security through efficient irrigation methods
*   Enhanced livelihoods through increased crop yields and reduced energy costs

## Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation practices can significantly improve peri-urban households' access to clean cooking energy.

### Key Recommendations

*   Policy support for the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems
*   Capacity building for local communities on climate-resilient irrigation practices
*   Research and development of more efficient and cost-effective agroforestry-micro-hydro technologies

## Actions/Recommendations List

1.  **Policy Support:** Advocate for policies that support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, including tax incentives and subsidies for local communities.
2.  **Capacity Building:** Provide training and capacity-building programs for local communities on climate-resilient irrigation practices and agroforestry-micro-hydro technologies.
3.  **Research and Development:** Encourage research and development of more efficient and cost-effective agroforestry-micro-hydro technologies.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to cleaner cooking methods is crucial for peri-urban households in the Sahel region, where climate-related challenges are severe. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation practices, these households can reduce their reliance on biomass fuels and improve water security.
