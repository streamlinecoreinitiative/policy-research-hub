**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

The Mesoamerican Highlands are a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from highland wetlands. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use. This brief outlines the challenges, benefits, and policy recommendations for adopting these integrated solutions in the region.

**Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts**

The Mesoamerican Highlands are characterized by highland wetlands that play a crucial role in regulating regional hydrology. However, climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, increased evaporation rates, and reduced water availability (NOAA climate dataset). These changes have severe implications for agriculture, which is the primary source of livelihoods for smallholder farmers in the region.

* **Climate Change Impacts:**
	+ Erratic rainfall patterns
	+ Increased evaporation from highland wetlands
	+ Reduced water availability [verify]
* **Importance of Resilient Irrigation Methods:**
	+ Food security and economic stability
	+ Poverty reduction among smallholder farmers

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

The region's existing irrigation systems, including boreholes and canals, are inefficient and often exacerbate poverty. Water loss through evaporation and seepage is significant [verify].

* **Existing Irrigation Systems:**
	+ Boreholes
	+ Canals
* **Water Loss Challenges:**
	+ Evaporation
	+ Seepage

**Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro for Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration (Mexican Ministry of Agriculture publications). When integrated with micro-hydro technology, these systems can provide a sustainable solution for irrigation.

* **Benefits of Agroforestry:**
	+ Soil health
	+ Biodiversity
	+ Carbon sequestration
* **Micro-Hydro Technology:**
	+ Small-scale hydroelectric systems
	+ Reduced reliance on diesel generators

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of these integrated solutions, policy recommendations include:

1. Provide financial incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop and implement policies that promote the use of renewable energy in irrigation systems.
3. Conduct further research on the economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data relevant to selected highland regions.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Provide financial incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop and implement policies that promote the use of renewable energy in irrigation systems.
3. Conduct further research on the economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data relevant to selected highland regions.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for enhancing water security and renewable energy use in the Mesoamerican Highlands. By addressing the challenges posed by climate change, smallholder farmers can improve their livelihoods and contribute to regional food security.

Changes made:

* Removed speculative claim about "disaster losses" as it is not evidence-backed.
* Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
* Preserved length similar to original draft.
* Kept title consistent with outline.
