**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and limited access to clean energy. This brief highlights the importance of microgrids for rural clinics in this region, which can support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We propose an integrated approach combining agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with renewable energy sources to provide climate-resilient water supply and energy access.

### Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Focus on Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

#### **Water Security**

*   Erratic rainfall patterns and changing precipitation seasons have led to severe droughts in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, affecting agriculture and food security.
*   Irrigation systems are often inefficient, resulting in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage.

#### **Clean Energy**

*   The region relies heavily on diesel generators for energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
*   Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can provide a cleaner alternative but require reliable and efficient energy storage solutions.

#### **Climate Adaptation**

*   Climate-resilient water supply systems are essential for rural communities, which often lack access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities.
*   Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can help mitigate the impacts of climate change by promoting soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.

### Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs: Microgrids for Rural Clinics

#### **Benefits of Microgrids**

*   Microgrids can provide reliable and efficient energy access to rural clinics, reducing reliance on diesel generators and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
*   These systems can also support climate-resilient water supply by integrating renewable energy sources with agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

#### **Pilot Projects and Case Studies**

*   Several pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in providing climate-resilient water supply and energy access.
*   These initiatives can serve as models for scaling up efforts to support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.

### Policy Recommendations

#### **Supporting Adoption at Scale**

*   Governments should provide subsidies, low-interest loans, and infrastructure development to support the adoption of microgrids for rural clinics.
*   International organizations and donors can also play a crucial role by providing technical assistance, funding, and capacity-building programs.

#### **Suggested Areas for Further Research**

*   Long-term sustainability assessments of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems are needed to validate their effectiveness in supporting adaptation targets.
*   Community engagement strategies should be developed to ensure the participation and ownership of local communities in these initiatives.

### Closing Outlook

The Sudano-Sahelian belt faces significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity and limited access to clean energy. Microgrids for rural clinics can play a crucial role in supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs by providing climate-resilient water supply and energy access. By adopting an integrated approach combining agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with renewable energy sources, we can help build more resilient communities and promote sustainable development.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** to support the adoption of microgrids for rural clinics.
2.  **Establish partnerships** between governments, international organizations, donors, and local communities to ensure the successful implementation of these initiatives.
3.  **Conduct further research** on long-term sustainability assessments and community engagement strategies to validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.

By taking a proactive approach to addressing environmental challenges in lower-income countries, we can help build more resilient communities and promote sustainable development.
