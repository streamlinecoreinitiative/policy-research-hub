**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1] and less than half (53.3%) accessing electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023), there is an urgent need for targeted interventions that integrate renewable energy solutions with sustainable water management strategies. We recommend expanding access to safe drinking water through community-based systems, strengthening renewable energy integration, and enhancing climate resilience through water management.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change, characterized by frequent droughts, floods, and extreme weather events (World Bank Open Data, 2021) [2]. Access to safe drinking water remains a significant challenge, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed water sources (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1]. In terms of electricity, just over half (53.3%) of the region's population has access to reliable power (World Bank Open Data, 2023), leaving millions without essential services and exacerbating economic disparities.

The lack of clean energy options further compounds these issues, with renewable energy consumption at only 19.7% globally in 2020 (World Bank Open Data) [3]. This disparity not only impacts daily living but also hampers efforts to develop sustainable economies and support climate adaptation measures. The United Nations (UN) reports that approximately 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe water, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa (UN-Water/WHO) [4].

### Analysis

The challenges faced by Sub-Saharan African countries in securing sustainable water sources and reliable energy supply are compounded by climate change impacts such as more frequent droughts and erratic rainfall patterns. Data from the World Bank indicates that only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, with this figure dropping significantly to just 53.3% for electricity (World Bank Open Data) [1]. Furthermore, renewable energy consumption stands at a mere 19.7% globally in 2020, underscoring the need for accelerated adoption and integration.

Research from UN-Water/WHO reveals that approximately 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe water, emphasizing the critical nature of addressing these issues within Sub-Saharan Africa (UN-Water/WHO) [4]. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030; however, only 74% global coverage has been achieved as per UN SDG Report 2023.

### Policy Recommendations

To address the pressing challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa concerning water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience, we recommend the following specific interventions:

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Implement community-based water supply systems that prioritize piped water connections. Promote the use of rainwater harvesting techniques and provide subsidies for households to install household water treatment facilities.
	* Target: Increase access to safely managed drinking water by at least 10 percentage points over five years.
2. **Strengthen Renewable Energy Integration**: Encourage investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation projects. Develop policies that incentivize the adoption of renewable energy solutions for households and small businesses, particularly in rural areas.
	* Target: Achieve a 25% increase in renewable energy consumption by 2030.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience through Water Management**: Implement watershed management programs that involve indigenous communities. Develop early warning systems to mitigate the impact of climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods, ensuring they are equipped with appropriate infrastructure.
	* Target: Establish at least one successful pilot project for integrated water-resource management in a major urban area by 2025.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require substantial investment. For example, expanding access to safe drinking water through community-based systems could cost approximately $1 billion over five years (estimated), while strengthening renewable energy integration might necessitate an initial outlay of $400 million for infrastructure development.

Potential barriers include limited funding, bureaucratic hurdles, and resistance from communities who may be skeptical about new technologies or practices. It is essential to engage stakeholders early in the planning process to address these concerns and ensure buy-in from all parties involved.

### Conclusion

The urgent need to bridge water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience gaps cannot be overstated for Sub-Saharan Africa's sustainable development trajectory. By adopting evidence-based recommendations such as those outlined here, governments can make significant strides toward achieving these goals. We call upon all stakeholders – government officials, NGO leaders, and development practitioners – to prioritize and invest in the implementation of these initiatives.

**Next Steps**: Establish a task force comprised of relevant ministries and NGOs to oversee the design and execution of these recommendations. Conduct pilot projects in selected regions to refine strategies based on lessons learned. Collaborate with international partners to secure additional funding for long-term sustainability and scale-up efforts.
