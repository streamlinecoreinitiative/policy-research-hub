**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Andean Highlands: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends investing [VERIFY] annually in renewable energy infrastructure and promoting clean cooking solutions to address water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa. By prioritizing these interventions, governments can create a more resilient future that improves the quality of life and economic opportunities for millions.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately affected by water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts. Recent data from the World Bank highlights stark disparities:

- **Water Access**: Less than a third of Sub-Saharan Africa's population (32.4%) has access to safely managed drinking water [1].
- **Electricity Access**: Only 53.3% of residents have reliable electricity, severely impacting daily life and economic activities [2].
- **Renewable Energy Consumption**: The region lags far behind global trends with just 19.7% of total final energy consumption coming from renewable sources [3].

These issues necessitate urgent policy interventions that prioritize clean energy access, improved water security, and robust climate adaptation measures.

## Analysis

Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes investing in renewable energy infrastructure, promoting clean cooking solutions, and enhancing water security. For instance:

- Investing in solar, wind, and hydro projects can boost renewable energy consumption to [VERIFY] by 2030 [4].
- Implementing subsidies or vouchers for clean cookstoves (like biogas) can reduce indoor air pollution, improve health outcomes, and lower greenhouse gas emissions from traditional cooking practices [5].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy Infrastructure**: Increase investment in solar, wind, and hydro projects across Sub-Saharan Africa to boost renewable energy consumption.
2. **Promote Clean Cooking Solutions**: Implement subsidies or vouchers for clean cookstoves (like biogas) to reduce indoor air pollution, improve health outcomes, and lower greenhouse gas emissions from traditional cooking practices.
3. **Enhance Water Security**: Strengthen water resource management through watershed co-management with indigenous councils, implementing early warning systems, and expanding access to improved sanitation facilities.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Estimated costs for renewable energy projects range from [VERIFY] billion to [VERIFY] billion annually in Sub-Saharan Africa. Clean cooking solutions cost approximately [VERIFY] billion per year.
- **Barriers**: Political will, lack of financial resources, and institutional capacity constraints may pose challenges.

## Conclusion

Strengthening resilience through improved access to clean energy, enhanced water security, and climate adaptation measures is crucial for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By prioritizing these interventions, governments can create a more resilient future that supports economic growth, health outcomes, and environmental sustainability.
