# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Indus Watershed: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

The Indus watershed is a critical region in South Asia, supporting a vast network of rivers and freshwater ecosystems essential for agriculture, industry, and human consumption. Landslides and water scarcity pose significant threats to this region's ecological integrity and economic stability. This brief explores nature-based solutions for landslide risk management and climate-resilient irrigation systems in the Indus watershed.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Indus Watershed

The Indus watershed spans across six countries in South Asia, including Pakistan, India, China, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity through increased evaporation rates, altered precipitation patterns, and reduced snowmelt.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address water scarcity in the Indus watershed. These integrated systems combine agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric power generation, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

## Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk Management

Landslides are a significant threat to the Indus watershed's freshwater ecosystems, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and human settlements. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can help mitigate landslide risk by stabilizing soil through tree roots and promoting sustainable land use practices.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of agroforestry-micro-hydro integration for climate-resilient irrigation. These systems can provide a reliable source of clean energy while reducing water loss through evaporation and seepage.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Support policy reforms**: Encourage governments in the Indus watershed region to adopt policies promoting agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.
2.  **Invest in pilot projects**: Support the development of pilot projects demonstrating the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Enhance community engagement**: Foster partnerships between local communities, governments, and international organizations to promote the adoption of nature-based solutions for landslide risk management.

## Closing Outlook

The Indus watershed's freshwater ecosystems are critical components of South Asia's ecological integrity and economic stability. By leveraging nature-based solutions such as agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we can mitigate landslide risk, address water scarcity, and promote climate-resilient irrigation practices in this region.
