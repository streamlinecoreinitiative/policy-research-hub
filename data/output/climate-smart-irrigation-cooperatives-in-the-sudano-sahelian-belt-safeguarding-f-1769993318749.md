# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. These cooperatives will integrate innovative water harvesting techniques, renewable energy systems, and climate-resilient infrastructure to enhance the resilience of local communities. By investing $[VERIFY] million over five years, governments can support the development of these cooperatives, improving access to safe drinking water (currently at 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa) and reliable electricity (53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa), while also promoting climate adaptation.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries are disproportionately affected by water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts. With only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], the need for robust interventions is urgent. Similarly, only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)]. Moreover, global renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)], highlighting a critical need for accelerated adoption and integration into national development plans.

## Analysis

The current situation in lower-income countries underscores the need for comprehensive policy interventions:

- **Water Security**: Access to safe drinking water is crucial yet elusive; only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans have such access [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. This disparity contributes to health issues and limits economic productivity.
- **Clean Energy**: Despite global efforts towards renewable energy integration, the penetration rate remains low in Sub-Saharan Africa at 53.3% [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)], far below the world average of 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)]. This disparity exacerbates energy poverty and environmental degradation.
- **Climate Adaptation**: The region's climate resilience frameworks are weak, leading to frequent crop failures and displacement of populations due to natural disasters [Source: NOAA (2024)].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**:
   - Invest in water harvesting infrastructure and desalination plants to increase access to safe drinking water.
   - Promote community-led initiatives for water conservation and sustainable use of resources.

2. **Accelerate Clean Energy Transition**:
   - Implement feed-in tariffs and subsidies to encourage private sector investment in renewable energy projects.
   - Develop supportive regulatory frameworks that facilitate the deployment of solar, wind, and hydro power technologies.

3. **Enhance Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Development**:
   - Invest in early warning systems for climate-related disasters to mitigate loss of life and property damage.
   - Build flood-resistant infrastructure and implement sustainable urban planning practices.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful consideration of various practical aspects, including:

- **Funding**: Securing adequate funding through public-private partnerships, international aid, and domestic resource mobilization.
- **Capacity Building**: Training local communities in water management techniques and renewable energy technologies to ensure effective implementation.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborating with NGOs, community leaders, and government bodies for inclusive planning processes.

## Conclusion

Addressing the challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is not only feasible but essential for fostering sustainable development in lower-income countries. By adopting evidence-based policies and engaging all stakeholders, we can achieve significant improvements in these critical areas, thereby enhancing resilience and improving living standards for millions. The establishment of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt offers a promising pathway forward.

**Next Steps**: Develop a comprehensive implementation roadmap with clear timelines and resource allocation strategies to ensure successful scaling of proposed interventions. Engage policymakers, donors, and local communities to build support and momentum for transformative change.
