# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sahel: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends integrating climate-resilient practices into school feeding supply chains in the Sahel region, which is critical to addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges. With only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), and less than half of households having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data), these issues not only impact daily living conditions but also hinder economic development and public health. Climate change intensifies these challenges by causing more frequent droughts and floods, which exacerbate existing challenges.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 1.2 billion people, where access to safe drinking water remains limited (32.4%) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Sub-Saharan Africa also has one of the lowest rates of electricity access globally ([VERIFY]%), with rural areas being particularly underserved (World Bank Open Data). These challenges are exacerbated by climate change, including frequent droughts and unpredictable rainfall patterns.

## Analysis

### Water Security:

Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water sources, leaving millions without adequate sanitation facilities (UN-Water/WHO). Improving this situation requires investment in infrastructure such as wells, boreholes, and pipelines.

### Clean Energy Access:

Electricity access stands at only 53.3%, with rural areas disproportionately affected. The World Bank estimates that achieving universal electricity access could lift 120 million people out of poverty ([VERIFY]%) (World Bank Open Data).

### Climate Adaptation:

Climate change impacts like droughts, floods, and desertification threaten water security and agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Without adaptation measures, the region risks significant economic losses and social instability.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Enhance Water Security**:
    *   Invest in rural water supply systems such as boreholes, pipelines, and rainwater harvesting ponds.
    *   Promote community-managed water points to ensure sustainable use and maintenance.
    *   Implement desalination projects for coastal areas with limited freshwater resources.

2.  **Promote Renewable Energy Access**:
    *   Develop microgrids in remote rural communities using solar-powered mini-grids and wind turbines.
    *   Encourage off-grid renewable energy technologies like solar home systems to extend electricity access.
    *   Invest in grid-connected renewable energy projects, such as solar PV farms, to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

3.  **Strengthen Climate Resilience**:
    *   Implement early warning systems for droughts and floods using satellite data and local weather stations.
    *   Support climate-resilient agriculture through research and development of drought-resistant crops.
    *   Promote afforestation and agroforestry practices to enhance water retention in soils.

## Implementation Considerations

*   **Costs**: Initial investments will require significant financial resources, including grants from international agencies like the World Bank. Sustainable financing mechanisms such as micro-insurance schemes can be explored to ensure long-term viability.
*   **Barriers**: Political instability, lack of institutional capacity, and technical challenges may hinder implementation. Collaboration between government entities, NGOs, and private sector partners will be crucial for successful project execution.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a comprehensive approach that integrates policy interventions with effective implementation strategies. By investing in resilient water supply systems, renewable energy projects, and climate adaptation measures, the region can enhance its ability to withstand future shocks while fostering sustainable economic growth.
