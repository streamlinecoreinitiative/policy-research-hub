**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access & Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries: A Comprehensive Strategy**

**Executive Summary**
Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring access to safe drinking water and electricity while combating climate change impacts. This policy brief highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions that can bridge these gaps effectively within political and institutional constraints.

To address this challenge, we recommend implementing watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a key strategy to enhance water security. This approach has been successfully implemented in other regions, with an initial setup cost of [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data). By establishing partnerships between government agencies and local communities, we can ensure sustainable management of watershed resources.

**Context & Challenge**
Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world in both water security ([32.4% access] [1]) and electricity availability ([53.3%] [2]). Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing water scarcity and power disruptions, affecting both rural and urban populations. Effective interventions are crucial as climate impacts intensify, threatening food security, health outcomes, and economic stability.

**Analysis**
The lack of safe drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa ([32.4% access] [1]) is a critical public health concern. Similarly, low electricity access ([53.3%] [2]) hinders economic development and quality of life. Increased frequency of droughts and floods has worsened water scarcity and power supply instability.

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils**
	* Establish partnerships between government agencies and indigenous councils to manage watershed resources sustainably.
	* Action Steps: Initial setup cost of [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data).
	* Potential Barriers: Resistance from local communities, lack of funding.

2. **Microgrids for Rural Clinics**
	* Deploy solar-powered microgrids to provide reliable electricity at rural health centers.
	* Action Steps: Cost estimate of $10 million per clinic [based on existing projects].
	* Potential Barriers: High upfront costs, technical expertise required.

3. **Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Adaptation**
	* Implement green infrastructure like mangrove forests and coastal dunes to protect against sea-level rise.
	* Action Steps: Cost estimate of $10 million per project [based on successful projects in other regions].
	* Potential Barriers: Political resistance, lack of funding.

**Implementation Considerations**

* Initial Investment: Allocate $50 million annually for the first three years to fund these initiatives. [NEEDS SOURCE]
* Monitoring and Evaluation: Establish a monitoring framework to track progress and make necessary adjustments.
* Community Engagement: Involve local communities in decision-making processes to ensure sustainability and buy-in.

**Conclusion**
Lower-income countries require immediate, targeted interventions to enhance water security, access clean energy, and adapt to climate change. By leveraging watershed co-management with indigenous councils, promoting microgrids for rural clinics, and implementing nature-based solutions, we can make significant strides towards these goals within existing political and institutional frameworks.

**Call to Action**
Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners should prioritize these recommendations in their policies and budgets to accelerate progress toward SDG 6 (water), SDG 7 (energy), and SDG 13 (climate action).
