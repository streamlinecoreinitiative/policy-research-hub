# Executive Summary

**Climate Resilient Water Supply Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Energy Access and Renewable Integration**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends strengthening resilient water supply systems in Sub-Saharan Africa through integrated renewable energy solutions to improve energy access, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and enhance climate adaptation. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), there is a critical need for innovative solutions that address both water security and renewable energy integration.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts, with limited access to safe drinking water and electricity exacerbating this vulnerability. According to World Bank data, only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan African population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), while electricity access stands at 53.3% (World Bank Open Data). This highlights the urgent need for robust resilience strategies.

    - Access to electricity (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2023): 53.3 [Source: World Bank Open Data]

### Analysis

Climate resilience in water supply systems is crucial for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa, where climate change impacts are already evident. Renewable energy integration can provide a sustainable solution by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

- **Key Evidence**:
    - World Bank data indicates only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa (2024).
    - Access to electricity is also unevenly distributed, with only 53.3% of the population having access by 2023.
    - Renewable energy consumption as a percentage of total final energy consumption for the world was [VERIFY] [Source: World Bank Open Data].

### Policy Recommendations

To enhance resilience, policy recommendations should focus on:

1. **Developing and Implementing Integrated Water Supply Systems with Renewable Energy Integration**: Governments and development partners should collaborate to develop policies that promote integrated water supply systems incorporating renewable energy solutions.
2. **Allocating Resources for Infrastructure Development**: Allocate resources for infrastructure development that incorporates renewable energy solutions, ensuring a sustainable and climate-resilient water supply system.
3. **Enhancing Institutional Capacity**: Enhance institutional capacity to manage resilient water supply systems effectively through training and capacity-building programs.

### Implementation Considerations

To ensure these recommendations are feasible:

- **Conduct Cost Analysis**: Estimate costs associated with developing and implementing integrated water supply systems with renewable energy integration.
- **Identify Barriers**: Identify potential barriers such as funding constraints, technical challenges, and institutional resistance.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage stakeholders including government officials, NGOs, and communities to facilitate buy-in and ensure successful implementation.

### Conclusion

Climate-resilient water supply systems are essential for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By integrating renewable energy into water supply systems, we can improve energy access while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This brief calls for immediate action from policymakers and stakeholders to address the critical needs of this region.

**Call to Action**: Develop comprehensive policy frameworks, allocate necessary resources, and engage all relevant stakeholders to implement resilient water supply systems with integrated renewable energy solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa.
