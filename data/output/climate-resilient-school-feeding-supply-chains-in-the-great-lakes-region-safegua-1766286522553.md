# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Great Lakes Region: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region is home to over 400 million people, relying heavily on freshwater resources for agriculture, industry, and domestic use. However, climate change poses significant threats to water security, affecting agricultural productivity, food security, and economic stability. This brief highlights the importance of integrating climate-resilient practices into school feeding supply chains in the region.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Great Lakes Region

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Great Lakes region through:

* Erratic rainfall patterns
* Increased evaporation due to rising temperatures
* Changes in precipitation distribution, leading to more frequent droughts and floods

These impacts threaten food security, economic stability, and human well-being. Resilient irrigation methods are essential for ensuring stable agricultural productivity.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Great Lakes region include:

* Boreholes
* Canals
* Surface water diversion

However, these systems suffer from significant water loss percentages due to evaporation and seepage. The exact percentage of water loss is unclear without further data [verify].

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

* Water retention
* Reduced erosion
* Increased crop yields

Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving water retention and reducing erosion.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a low-cost, renewable energy solution for irrigation systems. Benefits include:

* Reduced reliance on diesel generators
* Increased energy efficiency
* Improved water management

Pilot projects showcase the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro, highlighting cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a holistic approach to climate-resilient water supply. Benefits include:

* Reduced energy consumption
* Improved water retention
* Increased crop yields

Economic analysis highlights the cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support adoption at scale, we recommend:

1. **Policy frameworks** that incentivize the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
2. **Capacity building** programs to enhance knowledge and skills among farmers, policymakers, and practitioners.
3. **Research initiatives** to explore economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Develop policy frameworks that support the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation methods.
2. Establish capacity building programs for farmers, policymakers, and practitioners.
3. Conduct further research on economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability.

## Closing Outlook

Climate change poses significant threats to water security in the Great Lakes region. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into school feeding supply chains, we can promote sustainable agriculture, reduce energy consumption, and safeguard freshwater ecosystems. This brief highlights the importance of climate-resilient practices and provides a framework for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to work together towards a more water-secure future.
