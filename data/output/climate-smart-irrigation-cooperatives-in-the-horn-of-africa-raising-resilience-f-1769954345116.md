# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: raising resilience finance for communities

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

To enhance water security, clean energy adoption, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa. These cooperatives will provide communities with access to safe drinking water, promote renewable energy use through efficient irrigation systems, and increase resilience to climate-related disasters. We urge governments, international organizations, and local stakeholders to invest in these initiatives, leveraging funding from sources such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and multilateral development banks.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Recent data highlights the urgency of these issues: only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], while just 53.3% have electricity [2]. The continent's reliance on fossil fuels for energy consumption is unsustainable, with less than 10% of its final energy consumption coming from renewable sources [3]. Climate change impacts such as droughts and floods are becoming more frequent and severe, further straining water resources and infrastructure.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate WASH facilities, leading to poor health outcomes. The World Bank reports that 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], far below global standards.
- **Clean Energy**: Inadequate access to electricity affects nearly half of households in Sub-Saharan Africa, with renewable energy consumption at only 9.2% [3]. This hinders economic productivity and exacerbates climate vulnerability due to reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts such as droughts and floods are becoming more frequent and severe, further straining water resources and infrastructure.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**:
   - Implement comprehensive WASH programs to improve sanitation facilities.
   - Invest in rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants where feasible.
   - Promote community-based management of water resources through cooperatives or local authorities.

2. **Promote Clean Energy Adoption**:
   - Increase public investment in renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind power.
   - Offer subsidies for households to adopt clean cooking solutions like biogas stoves.
   - Develop micro-grids and mini-grid systems to provide reliable electricity to remote areas.

3. **Build Climate Resilience**:
   - Strengthen early warning systems for climate-related disasters.
   - Implement drought-resistant crop varieties and improve irrigation infrastructure.
   - Encourage reforestation efforts to enhance water retention in soils.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Mobilize international financial support, including grants from the GEF and concessional loans from multilateral development banks.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with NGOs, private sector entities, and local governments for effective implementation.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local officials and community leaders in sustainable resource management practices.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, clean energy adoption, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is essential to achieving inclusive development. By implementing the recommended policies and considering practical considerations, decision-makers can significantly improve living conditions and long-term sustainability for all communities. We urge governments, international organizations, and local stakeholders to prioritize these initiatives, investing in climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a key strategy.
