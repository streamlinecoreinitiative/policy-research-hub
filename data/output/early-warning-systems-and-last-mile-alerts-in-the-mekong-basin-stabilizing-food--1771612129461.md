**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Southeast Asia: Strengthening Infrastructure and Adaptation Efforts**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends investing $5 billion annually to enhance water infrastructure and promote renewable energy adoption in Southeast Asia. This investment can significantly reduce the number of people without access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1] and provide electricity to underserved areas. Furthermore, allocating $10 billion over the next five years for climate-resilient water management practices will help safeguard freshwater resources.

## Context & Challenge

Southeast Asia is one of the fastest-growing regions globally with a rapidly expanding population and industrialization processes (UN-Water/WHO, 2022) [2]. However, this growth has put immense pressure on natural resources such as water and energy. According to UN-Water/WHO (2022), 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water [3]. In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, the percentage of population with access to electricity is only 53.3% (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1], which may not be accurate as the global average for access to electricity is reported differently in other sources.

## Analysis

### Water Security

The World Bank's data indicates that less than a third of Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1], while 74% global coverage is reported for SDG 6 progress - safely managed water [4]. This stark difference highlights significant disparities and underscores the necessity for targeted interventions in Southeast Asian countries.

### Clean Energy

Renewable energy consumption in the region stands at only 9.2% (World Bank Open Data, 2021) [5], far below global averages. The World Bank’s recent data shows that Sub-Saharan Africa lags even more significantly with access to electricity at just 53.3% (World Bank Open Data, 2023) [6]. However, the global average for renewable energy consumption is reported differently in other sources.

### Climate Adaptation

Southeast Asia's vulnerability to climate change is well-documented. The region experiences frequent flooding and droughts, with impacts exacerbated by population growth and urbanization. Climate-resilient water management practices are essential for safeguarding freshwater resources.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**: Invest in expanding access to safe drinking water through improved sanitation facilities and water treatment plants.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Support renewable energy projects that can provide electricity to underserved areas.
3. **Climate Resilience Initiatives**: Implement climate-resilient water management practices such as rainwater harvesting, flood control measures, and early warning systems.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Total annual investment for water security and clean energy initiatives could range from $15 to $20 billion (based on recent World Bank estimates) [7], which may not be accurate.
- **Barriers**: Political resistance, lack of coordination among stakeholders, and insufficient financial resources are potential barriers. Overcoming these requires collaboration between governments, NGOs, and international development partners.

## Conclusion

Ensuring water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Southeast Asia is a pressing need that can be achieved through strategic interventions. By addressing the root causes of disparities and leveraging existing data and expertise, the region can build more resilient and sustainable infrastructures for its future generations.
