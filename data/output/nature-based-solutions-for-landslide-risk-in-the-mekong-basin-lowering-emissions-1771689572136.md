# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong basin: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief emphasizes the need to address landslide risk in the Mekong basin through nature-based solutions, which can lower emissions from critical sectors such as energy and transportation. We recommend investing in infrastructure projects like water treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water (World Bank Open Data: 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population have access to safely managed drinking water [1]). Additionally, we suggest prioritizing the expansion of renewable energy sources, particularly solar power, which is both cost-effective and scalable (World Bank Open Data: Renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7% globally [2]).

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in securing clean drinking water, accessing reliable energy sources, and adapting to climate impacts. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where 32.4% of the population have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data [1]), the region lags behind other regions such as East Asia (86.5%) and Central America (79.1%). Similarly, only 53.3% of people in Sub-Saharan Africa have access to electricity (World Bank Open Data [3]). These disparities underscore urgent needs for sustainable solutions that not only improve current conditions but also fortify against future climate challenges.

## Analysis

Recent data from the World Bank shows significant gaps in water security and energy access across these regions. For instance, while 91.6% of the world has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data [3]), just 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population enjoys this benefit. Furthermore, renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7% globally (World Bank Open Data [2]), indicating a substantial room for growth in clean energy adoption.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges effectively, we propose the following policy recommendations:

1. **Enhanced Water Security**: Invest in infrastructure projects like water treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Implement water conservation measures such as rainwater harvesting systems and promote efficient agricultural practices that reduce water usage.
2. **Increased Clean Energy Access**: Prioritize the expansion of renewable energy sources, particularly solar power, which is both cost-effective and scalable.
	* Encourage public-private partnerships for financing large-scale projects like wind farms and hydroelectric plants in suitable locations.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning to ensure sustainability and efficiency. Key considerations include:

1. **Funding Mechanisms**: Explore innovative funding mechanisms such as carbon credits, green bonds, and international aid to support project implementation.
2. **Community Engagement**: Engage local communities through participatory approaches to ensure projects are inclusive and sustainable in the long term.

## Conclusion

Addressing landslide risk in the Mekong basin requires a comprehensive approach that incorporates nature-based solutions. By investing in infrastructure projects like water treatment facilities and prioritizing the expansion of renewable energy sources, we can lower emissions from critical sectors while improving access to safe drinking water and electricity. We urge governments and stakeholders to take immediate action to implement these recommendations and ensure a more resilient future for all.
