**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: A Resilient Path Forward for Lower-Income Countries**

### Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face critical challenges in ensuring water security, promoting clean energy access, and enhancing climate resilience. To address these pressing issues, we recommend implementing evidence-based solutions focusing on renewable energy, improved water management, and climate adaptation strategies.

### Context & Challenge

The global population lacking safe water has reached 2.2 billion people [Source: UN-Water/WHO], with Sub-Saharan Africa facing a stark disparity in access to electricity, at only 53.3% of the population having access [Source: World Bank]. As climate change intensifies, these challenges are exacerbated, necessitating urgent and sustainable policy interventions.

### Analysis

The evidence is clear: lower-income countries struggle with water security and access to clean energy. Renewable energy consumption remains low, at 19.7% of total final energy consumption worldwide [Source: World Bank].

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security**:
	* Invest in rainwater harvesting ponds to reduce water loss.
	* Implement micro-insurance schemes to provide financial protection against droughts.
	* Cost estimates range from $100-$200 per household for micro-insurance [VERIFY]
2. **Clean Energy**:
	* Develop solar-powered irrigation systems in secondary cities to reduce reliance on diesel generators.
	* Integrate solar panels into existing water pump stations, reducing operational costs by up to 50% annually [Source: World Bank].
3. **Climate Adaptation**:
	* Promote agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Lower Mekong delta to safeguard freshwater ecosystems.
	* Financial support through grants, low-interest loans, and tax incentives can facilitate adoption.

### Implementation Considerations

Costs: Micro-insurance schemes cost approximately $100-$200 per household [VERIFY], while solar-powered irrigation systems for secondary cities require an investment ranging from $500-$1,000 per system. Potential barriers include limited financial resources and political will. Building partnerships with private sector entities can help overcome these barriers.

### Conclusion

Lower-income countries must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to build resilient future-proofed economies. By adopting evidence-based interventions such as micro-insurance for drought risk reduction and solar-powered irrigation systems, governments and development partners can make substantial strides toward achieving sustainable development goals.

**Call to Action**: Engage stakeholders in dialogue on these solutions to ensure their feasibility within local contexts and mobilize resources towards implementing them effectively.
