**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions and Improving Water Security**

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa's fisheries face significant challenges due to water insecurity, energy deficits, and climate change. To address these issues, we recommend integrating indigenous knowledge into government policies for watershed co-management. This approach has been successful in the Mekong region, where traditional practices have balanced water usage among stakeholders without depleting resources. We urge policymakers to strengthen watershed co-management initiatives involving indigenous councils, promote renewable energy adoption in rural areas, and fund climate adaptation projects.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the world's least electrified regions, with only 53.3% of its population having access to electricity by 2023 [Source: World Bank]. Water scarcity is a critical issue, particularly in rural areas where only 32.4% have safe drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Climate change intensifies these challenges, increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.

## Analysis

Traditional indigenous practices in the Mekong basin demonstrate effective water management under changing climates. For instance, indigenous councils in Cambodia use ancestral wisdom to balance water usage among different stakeholders without depleting resources [Source: World Bank]. Climate change impacts vary by region but exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, with CO2 emissions from deforestation accounting for 13% of global total [NEEDS SOURCE].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Watershed Co-Management Initiatives**: Engage indigenous councils in water resource management planning and implementation.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Invest in solar-powered wells for drinking water access and renewable energy projects to reduce deforestation and CO2 emissions.
3. **Funding Climate Adaptation Projects**: Allocate financial resources towards climate adaptation programs, including watershed co-management initiatives.

## Implementation Considerations

Collaborate with local communities on project design and implementation; ensure equitable distribution of benefits among stakeholders. Estimated costs for solar-powered wells range from $50 to $100 per household [NEEDS SOURCE]. Funding can come from international development agencies, domestic budgets, or climate funds.

## Conclusion

By integrating indigenous knowledge into government policies, we can enhance resilience against climate shocks while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This approach not only strengthens water security but also supports sustainable development goals. Let us act now to create a more resilient Sub-Saharan Africa.

**Additional Evidence Needed**

* Specific success stories or case studies from indigenous-led watershed co-management initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa.
* Detailed breakdown of potential financial investments required for solar-powered wells and renewable energy projects.
