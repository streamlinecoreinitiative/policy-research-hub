**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

Rwanda is among the countries facing significant climate-related challenges that threaten its water security and sustainable energy access. This brief highlights the importance of integrating renewable energy solutions, such as solar-powered irrigation pumps, with clean energy access initiatives to mitigate these risks while fostering economic growth and social stability. By adopting nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong basin, Rwanda can lower emissions from critical sectors and promote climate resilience.

**Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources and Energy Sector**

Rwanda is vulnerable to climate change impacts, including erratic rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures that threaten its water security and sustainable energy access. Climate projections indicate a 10-20% increase in temperature by 2050 (verify). Historical rainfall data shows significant variability, with some regions experiencing droughts while others experience floods (verify).

The impact of climate change on Rwanda's water resources is evident in the decline of agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods. According to local ministries, approximately 30% of households lack access to clean water, and agricultural yields have decreased by 15% due to droughts (verify). The energy sector is also affected, with a significant portion of the population relying on diesel-powered irrigation pumps that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

**Integrating Renewable Energy Solutions for Water Security and Clean Energy Access**

Solar-powered irrigation pumps offer a low-cost solution for smallholder farmers, reducing their reliance on diesel-powered pumps. A cost-benefit analysis comparing traditional diesel pumps with solar-powered ones is needed (verify). Preliminary data suggests that solar-powered pumping systems can benefit up to 50% of households in rural areas.

Wind energy and mini-grid schemes are also being implemented to improve access to reliable electricity in rural Rwanda. These initiatives have led to a 20% increase in electrification rates, with cost savings for rural communities (verify). The renewable energy sector is creating job opportunities in rural areas, with an estimated 10 jobs created per solar-powered irrigation project (verify).

**Adaptation Measures for Rising Temperatures and Landslide Risk**

Community-based initiatives like green roofs and urban gardens are being implemented to enhance water retention and reduce urban heat island effects. Projected temperature increases by 2050 indicate a need for urgent adaptation measures, with an estimated 5-10 cities implementing adaptive measures (verify).

Nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong basin can also be applied in Rwanda. By adopting these solutions, the country can lower emissions from critical sectors and promote climate resilience.

**Economic and Social Benefits of Integrated Solutions**

The integrated approach to renewable energy solutions and clean energy access initiatives is expected to create job opportunities in the renewable energy sector and agriculture. According to UN reports, an estimated 50% increase in household income is projected due to improved water security and clean energy access (verify).

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct a detailed cost analysis for scaling up renewable energy solutions in rural areas.
2. Develop long-term economic impact studies on job creation from solar-powered irrigation projects.
3. Conduct social acceptance surveys to understand community attitudes towards adopting new technologies.
4. Integrate nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong basin into Rwanda's climate change adaptation plan.

**Closing Outlook**

Rwanda has made significant progress in addressing climate-related challenges, but more needs to be done to ensure water security and sustainable energy access. By integrating renewable energy solutions with clean energy access initiatives and adopting nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong basin, Rwanda can lower emissions from critical sectors and promote climate resilience. The country's commitment to climate action is essential for achieving its development goals and ensuring a sustainable future for its citizens.
