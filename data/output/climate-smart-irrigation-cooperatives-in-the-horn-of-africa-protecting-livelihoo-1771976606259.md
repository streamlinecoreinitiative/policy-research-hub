# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a priority intervention. These cooperatives will not only improve access to clean drinking water but also enhance resilience to droughts and floods by promoting sustainable agriculture practices. We urge governments and development partners to allocate resources towards constructing new wells, pipelines, and treatment plants, particularly in areas with high population density and limited infrastructure.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately [VERIFY] million people, facing significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (53.3%) and electricity (53.3%), according to World Bank Open Data [1]. These statistics highlight how far behind the global average of 73.7% for access to safely managed drinking water and 53.3% for electricity access is [2]. Furthermore, with a global temperature rise of +1.1°C since pre-industrial times [3], Sub-Saharan Africa experiences more frequent and severe weather events such as droughts and floods, threatening existing infrastructure and exacerbating existing challenges.

## Analysis

The region also lags behind in renewable energy consumption (19.7%), which is essential for reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change impacts [4]. Climate finance needs are estimated at $5.8-5.9 trillion annually by 2030, with developing countries bearing a significant portion of this burden [5]. The limited access to clean drinking water and electricity is compounded by the region's vulnerability to climate change impacts like droughts and floods. These environmental stresses have led to increased health risks such as waterborne diseases and food insecurity.

## Policy Recommendations

To address the water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend the following policy interventions:

1. **Investment in Water Infrastructure**: Allocate resources towards constructing new wells, pipelines, and treatment plants to improve access to safe drinking water. Prioritize areas with high population density and limited infrastructure.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Technologies**: Encourage the adoption of solar-powered desalination plants for coastal regions that suffer from freshwater scarcity due to saltwater intrusion. Implement subsidies or tax incentives for renewable energy projects, particularly in rural communities where access is most critical.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Measures**: Develop early warning systems and last-mile alerts for droughts and floods. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure such as flood-resistant buildings and resilient transport corridors to minimize the impact of extreme weather events on livelihoods.
4. **Strengthen Governance and Institutional Capacity**: Establish or strengthen water management institutions at both national and local levels, ensuring coordination among various stakeholders including government departments, NGOs, and community groups.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a phased approach with clear timelines and milestones. For instance, the construction of new water infrastructure projects should be prioritized based on population density and economic feasibility. Similarly, renewable energy initiatives need to leverage existing government support mechanisms like grants, loans, and tax exemptions. Capacity building for local governance structures is crucial for effective management and maintenance of these facilities.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience to ensure sustainable development. By implementing evidence-based policies that address both immediate needs and long-term challenges, governments and development partners can make meaningful progress towards achieving SDG 6, 7, and 13. Collaboration across sectors and with local communities is essential for successful implementation.
