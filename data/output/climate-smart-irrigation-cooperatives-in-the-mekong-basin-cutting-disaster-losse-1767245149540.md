# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Mekong Basin: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

The Mekong basin is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts and floods that impact agricultural production and livelihoods. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to water scarcity in lower-income countries.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity**

Climate change affects agriculture worldwide, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and increased frequency of extreme events. In regions like the Mekong basin, climate data is crucial for understanding local impacts.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Limitations**

Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume significant amounts of energy, while canal systems waste resources due to evaporation and seepage.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

• [Verify] increase in soil organic matter
• Increase in native species biodiversity
• Carbon sequestration potential

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy.

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated systems can offer cost-effective solutions. [Verify] estimates suggest a total project cost per hectare is $10,000-$25,000, with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Policy Support:** Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Investment in Infrastructure:** Develop roads, storage facilities, and grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
3. **Capacity Building:** Provide training and technical assistance to farmers and local communities on sustainable irrigation practices.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives have the potential to transform agricultural production in lower-income countries like those in the Mekong basin. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can address water scarcity issues while contributing to broader sustainable development goals.

**Needed Evidence:**

1. **Climate Data:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Mekong basin (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Economic Analysis:** Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3. **Socioeconomic Studies:** Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

Changes made:

* Removed speculative claims without evidence (e.g., "immediate water scarcity issues" in Section 1).
* Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
* Preserved the title, which is specific to the Mekong basin.
* Tightened language throughout the brief.
