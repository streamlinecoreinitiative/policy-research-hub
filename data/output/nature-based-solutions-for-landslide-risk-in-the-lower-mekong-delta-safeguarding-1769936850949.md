# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Lower Mekong delta: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Lower Mekong Delta: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address landslide risk and freshwater ecosystem degradation in the Lower Mekong Delta. With only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), it is crucial that we prioritize nature-based solutions for landslide risk management. We recommend implementing cost-effective interventions such as rainwater harvesting, solar-powered mini-grids, and climate-smart agriculture to improve water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

The Lower Mekong Delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent landslides and floods threatening food security and economic stability. Climate change exacerbates existing challenges like droughts and floods, making it essential that we adapt our approaches to address these issues (IPCC, 2020). According to World Bank data, only [VERIFY] % of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity, with a significant gap in rural areas.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Access to safe drinking water is critical for health and development. Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind other regions, with only 32.4% having access (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Freshwater withdrawal accounts for [VERIFY] % of global resources, highlighting the need for efficient management practices (World Bank Open Data, 2021).

### Clean Energy

Less than half of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has electricity, particularly in rural areas. Renewable energy sources like solar power offer a sustainable solution, with [VERIFY] % of global renewable energy consumption coming from solar (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts are severe, including increased frequency and intensity of droughts and floods. Without adaptation measures, these challenges will worsen. According to the UN SDG Report 2023, [VERIFY] % global coverage has been achieved for safely managed water, but significant gaps remain in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Rainwater Harvesting**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems in urban and peri-urban areas to increase water supply.
2. **Solar-Powered Mini-Grids**: Deploy solar-powered mini-grids for off-grid communities to improve energy access.
3. **Climate-Smart Agriculture**: Promote drought-resistant crops and soil conservation techniques using climate-smart agriculture practices.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimated costs for implementing these interventions are modest compared to their long-term benefits. Potential barriers include limited financial resources and lack of awareness about the importance of climate resilience. Funding mechanisms such as grants, loans, or public-private partnerships can be explored to support implementation.

## Conclusion

The Lower Mekong Delta is a critical region that requires urgent attention to address landslide risk and freshwater ecosystem degradation. We recommend prioritizing nature-based solutions for landslide risk management, including rainwater harvesting, solar-powered mini-grids, and climate-smart agriculture. Immediate and sustained efforts are needed to ensure sustainable development in the region.
