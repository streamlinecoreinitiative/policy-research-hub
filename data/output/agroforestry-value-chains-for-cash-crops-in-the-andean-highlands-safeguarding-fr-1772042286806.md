**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Andean Highlands: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the pressing need to address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. To mitigate these issues, we recommend investing in agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Andean highlands. This approach can increase access to safe drinking water, promote renewable energy adoption, and enhance climate resilience.

**Key Recommendation:** Implement community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs to improve access to safe drinking water sources by 2030, with a focus on agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Andean highlands.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing a triple threat of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. According to World Bank data (2024), only [VERIFY] % of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, while just 53.3% have electricity (World Bank, 2023). Renewable energy consumption is limited, with a global average of 19.7% (World Bank, 2020).

The region's high population density and dependence on natural resources make it particularly vulnerable to climate change. Despite significant progress in some areas, access to safe water and electricity remains inadequate, especially for rural populations.

### Analysis

The lack of access to safely managed drinking water severely impacts public health and economic productivity (World Bank, 2024). In Sub-Saharan Africa, only [VERIFY] % have this basic amenity (World Bank, 2024), with the rest relying on contaminated sources or unsafe supplies.

Energy poverty hinders development efforts as electricity is essential for irrigation, health services, and economic activities (World Bank, 2023). In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023).

The region also struggles with climate adaptation, as extreme weather events become more frequent and intense due to climate change (IPCC, 2021). Climate resilience requires concerted efforts in water management, renewable energy development, and early warning systems.

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

*   **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Implement community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs to improve access to safe drinking water sources by 2030.
*   **Expand Renewable Energy Adoption**: Invest heavily in solar, wind, and hydro projects to increase renewable energy consumption from the current 19.7% to at least [VERIFY] % by 2030.
*   **Enhance Climate Adaptation Measures**: Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods to mitigate their impacts on water supplies, food security, and health.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require significant investment in infrastructure, technology transfer, and institutional support. Community participation is crucial in ensuring sustainability of water sources and energy projects. Costs for CLTS programs range from $10-$25 per household (World Bank, 2024), while renewable energy projects can vary widely depending on scale and type.

### Conclusion

Addressing the challenges of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa is imperative to ensure a sustainable future. By scaling up existing efforts and investing further into these areas, governments and development partners can significantly improve living standards and economic prospects for millions of people across the region.
