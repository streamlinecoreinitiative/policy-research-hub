**Revised Brief:**

**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Andean highlands are vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and poverty. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. By integrating agroforestry with traditional methods and leveraging micro-hydro technology, communities can ensure sustainable economic benefits while adapting to changing climate conditions.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Andean Highlands

The region's fragile environment is characterized by limited natural resources. Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity, population growth, and unsustainable agricultural practices. The current irrigation systems are inefficient, leading to significant economic losses for farmers.

### Current Practices and Challenges

* Existing irrigation systems rely heavily on fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
* Limited access to electricity hinders the adoption of micro-hydro technology.
* Water scarcity is further exacerbated by inefficient use of water resources and unsustainable agricultural practices.

### Agroforestry’s Role

Agroforestry has been shown to enhance soil fertility, improve water retention, and promote biodiversity. Integrating agroforestry with traditional irrigation methods can lead to:

* Improved crop yields
* Enhanced water management practices
* Reduced greenhouse gas emissions

Case studies demonstrate successful integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems in other regions.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a reliable and low-cost solution for generating electricity. Integrated with agroforestry, it can:

* Enhance system efficiency and sustainability
* Promote renewable energy consumption
* Support climate-resilient irrigation practices

Case studies showcase successful implementation of micro-hydro projects in various contexts.

### Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated approaches can contribute to climate resilience by:

* Promoting drought-resistant crops
* Improving water management practices
* Enhancing overall system efficiency and sustainability

Future research directions include improving system design, cost-effectiveness, and impact. Potential collaborations between stakeholders (governments, NGOs, private sector) are essential for scaling up these solutions.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

1. **Government policies** should support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems through:
	* Incentives for renewable energy consumption
	* Subsidies for micro-hydro technology
	* Training programs for farmers and technicians
2. **Future research directions** include:
	* Improving system design and cost-effectiveness [verify]
	* Enhancing impact assessment and monitoring
	* Exploring synergies with other climate-resilient practices

### Closing Outlook

The Andean highlands face significant environmental and socio-economic challenges. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for addressing water scarcity, promoting renewable energy consumption, and supporting climate adaptation targets in NDCs.

### Actions/Recommendations

1. **Develop and implement policies** that support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Conduct further research** on improving system design, cost-effectiveness, and impact.
3. **Establish collaborations** between governments, NGOs, private sector to scale up these solutions.
