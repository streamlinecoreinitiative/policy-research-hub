# Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in Caribbean Small Island Developing States: Supporting Adaptation Targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), particularly in terms of water security and clean energy access. The region's vulnerability to extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, exacerbates these issues. This brief explores the potential for flood-resilient transport corridors in the Caribbean SIDS, highlighting their role in supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts

Climate change is altering precipitation patterns, leading to increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods (IPCC, 2019). In the Caribbean SIDS, this has resulted in water scarcity, affecting agriculture, industry, and human consumption. The region's reliance on non-renewable energy sources contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Caribbean SIDS often rely on fossil fuels, leading to high operating costs and environmental degradation. Water loss through evaporation and seepage is a significant concern, particularly in areas with limited water resources (FAO, 2017).

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration (Nair et al., 2008). By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion and increase water retention. However, more research is needed to quantify the benefits of agroforestry for climate resilience.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for irrigation efficiency in the Caribbean SIDS (IRENA, 2019). Small-scale hydroelectric systems can provide renewable energy for pumping and other agricultural needs, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential for integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to enhance water security (e.g., [1]). However, more research is needed to validate the effectiveness of these integrated solutions and identify areas for further improvement.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of flood-resilient transport corridors in the Caribbean SIDS:

* Governments should provide subsidies or low-interest loans for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
* Infrastructure development, including roads and bridges, should prioritize climate resilience and flood protection.
* Communities should be engaged in planning and decision-making processes to ensure that their needs are met.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct a thorough analysis of existing irrigation systems and identify areas for improvement.
2. Develop and implement policies to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3. Engage with communities to ensure that their needs are met and that they are involved in planning and decision-making processes.

## Closing Outlook

Flood-resilient transport corridors have the potential to enhance water security, promote clean energy access, and support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs for the Caribbean SIDS. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, communities can reduce their vulnerability to climate-related hazards and improve their overall resilience.
