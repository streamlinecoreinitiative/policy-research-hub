# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Sahel region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including increased frequency and severity of landslides. Traditional agricultural practices exacerbate soil erosion and landslide risk, threatening food security and livelihoods of smallholder farmers. This brief explores nature-based solutions for landslide risk management through the integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems in the Sahel region.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sahel

The Sahel region is characterized by arid to semi-arid conditions, with limited rainfall and high evaporation rates. Climate change exacerbates water scarcity through increased temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and reduced water availability. Traditional irrigation methods contribute to water loss through evaporation and seepage.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Sahel are often inefficient, leading to significant water losses. Borehole-based systems rely on diesel generators for pumping, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and energy insecurity. Canals and traditional flood-irrigation methods also experience high levels of water loss through evaporation and seepage.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while enhancing water retention and reducing erosion. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, agroforestry systems can mitigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution for irrigation efficiency by harnessing kinetic energy from flowing water to generate electricity. This reduces reliance on diesel generators and decreases greenhouse gas emissions.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential for combined agroforestry-micro-hydro systems to enhance water security and renewable energy use. These integrated solutions can be cost-effective and scalable, supporting climate adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support adoption of these nature-based solutions at scale:

1.  **Integrate Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro into National Policies**: Incorporate agroforestry-micro-hydro systems into national policies and strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation.
2.  **Invest in Climate-Resilient Agriculture**: Allocate resources to support the development of climate-resilient agriculture practices, including agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies.
3.  **Enhance Community Engagement and Capacity Building**: Engage with local communities to build capacity for integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The Sahel region's vulnerability to climate change impacts underscores the need for nature-based solutions that enhance water security and renewable energy use. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs while promoting climate resilience among smallholder farmers.
