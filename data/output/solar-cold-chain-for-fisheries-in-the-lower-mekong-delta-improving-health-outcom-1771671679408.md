# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Lower Mekong delta: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. To address these issues, we recommend investing in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries in the Lower Mekong delta to improve health outcomes during heatwaves. This initiative will not only enhance water security but also promote clean energy access and build climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to a significant portion of the world's population lacking safe drinking water (2.2 billion people, UN-Water/WHO, 2022) and electricity (53.3%, World Bank Open Data, 2023). These challenges are exacerbated by climate change, leading to more frequent extreme weather events such as floods and droughts ([VERIFY]). The region's water security is particularly concerning, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024).

## Analysis

The challenges facing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa are deeply entrenched. Access to safe drinking water remains a significant issue, especially given the region's large population lacking this basic necessity. The low percentage of population with access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%, World Bank Open Data, 2024) indicates substantial room for improvement through infrastructure investment and innovation.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, policymakers should prioritize the following actionable steps:

1. **Investment in Solar-Powered Cold-Chain Systems**:
	* Implement solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries in the Lower Mekong delta to improve health outcomes during heatwaves.
	* Provide training and capacity-building programs for local communities on sustainable fishing practices and climate-resilient agriculture.
2. **Promoting Renewable Energy Access**:
	* Install solar panels at schools and clinics to provide reliable electricity, improving educational opportunities and health care services.
	* Encourage community-led initiatives that utilize renewable energy resources to enhance local economic development.
3. **Building Climate Resilience**:
	* Develop comprehensive early warning systems for climate-related disasters, including floods and droughts, to enable timely response and mitigation strategies.
	* Implement adaptive land use policies that incorporate climate change projections to minimize environmental degradation and enhance resilience.

## Implementation Considerations

While these recommendations are grounded in evidence-based approaches, several practical considerations must be addressed:

- **Funding Constraints**: Securing adequate funding through international aid, domestic budgets, and private sector partnerships will be crucial.
- **Technological Barriers**: Ensuring access to appropriate technology and expertise is essential for successful implementation.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience require urgent attention. By implementing the recommended policy actions, we can significantly improve living conditions and foster sustainable development pathways for the region. Collaboration among governments, NGOs, and international partners is essential to overcome these hurdles and ensure a more resilient future for Sub-Saharan Africa.
