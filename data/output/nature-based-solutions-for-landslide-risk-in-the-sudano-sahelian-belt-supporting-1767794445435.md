# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and frequent landslides that threaten agricultural productivity, livelihoods, and human lives. This brief highlights the importance of nature-based solutions (NBS) for landslide risk management and climate adaptation in this region.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity and Landslide Risk in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

The Sudano-Sahelian belt spans across several countries in West Africa, including Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Chad. This region is characterized by a semi-arid climate with limited rainfall, resulting in severe water scarcity and frequent droughts.

Landslides are another significant threat to the region, causing loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and displacement of communities. Climate change exacerbates landslide risk by altering precipitation patterns, increasing temperatures, and changing soil moisture levels.

### Current Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian belt rely heavily on surface water and rain-fed methods, which are often inefficient and unsustainable. Farmers face significant economic pressures due to reduced crop yields, limited access to reliable irrigation systems, and high dependency on imported diesel or other fuels.

The current challenges faced by farmers and communities include:

* Limited access to reliable irrigation systems [verify]
* Economic instability due to reduced crop yields
* High dependency on traditional methods (e.g., surface water, rain-fed)
* Limited efficiency and sustainability of existing irrigation systems

### Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, increase water retention, and enhance ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, and carbon sequestration. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can reduce water usage compared to traditional methods, while also providing cost savings through reduced energy consumption.

The benefits of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems include:

* Reduced environmental degradation through integrated management practices
* Increased water security by diversifying water sources
* Community empowerment through local ownership and maintenance

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the implementation of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we recommend the following policies:

1. **Funding mechanisms**: Establish public-private partnerships to support project development and provide funding for infrastructure development.
2. **Regulatory frameworks**: Collaborate with local communities and organizations to establish regulatory frameworks that support integrated management practices.
3. **Stakeholder involvement**: Involve stakeholders in the decision-making process to ensure community ownership and maintenance of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

Future research directions include:

1. **Economic feasibility studies**: Conduct economic viability assessments of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Long-term impact assessments**: Monitor long-term impacts on agricultural productivity, livelihoods, and climate resilience.
3. **Replication and scaling up**: Document successful projects and replicate efforts in other regions.

### Actions/Recommendations

1. Establish public-private partnerships to support project development and provide funding for infrastructure development.
2. Collaborate with local communities and organizations to establish regulatory frameworks that support integrated management practices.
3. Involve stakeholders in the decision-making process to ensure community ownership and maintenance of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

### Closing Outlook

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and frequent landslides. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a nature-based solution for landslide risk management and climate adaptation in this region. By implementing these solutions, we can ensure sustainable water management, economic development, and climate resilience for communities in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.

This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry practices with micro-hydro systems to enhance ecosystem services, reduce environmental degradation, and increase water security. We recommend policy changes and future research directions to support the implementation of these nature-based solutions.
