# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and rapidly urbanizing regions globally, with significant environmental implications. This brief focuses on peri-urban households, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to their reliance on traditional cooking methods that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Framework**

### Introduction

Climate change poses significant challenges to lower-income countries, particularly those with limited resources. The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is no exception, facing severe water scarcity due to climate change impacts such as erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from wetlands.

#### **Water Scarcity Overview**

* Climate change affects agriculture in the region through:
	+ Erratic rainfall patterns leading to reduced water availability for crops.
	+ Increased evaporation from wetlands exacerbating water scarcity issues.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

* Traditional irrigation systems in the region include boreholes and canals, resulting in significant water losses due to evaporation and seepage: [verify]
* The costs associated with manual labor and diesel generator fuel are substantial:
	+ $100 per day for manual labor in constructing and maintaining irrigation systems.
	+ $50 per month for diesel generator fuel.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

* **Soil Health Benefits:**
	+ Improved soil structure and water retention capacity due to vegetation cover.
	+ Examples of successful agroforestry projects demonstrating improved water retention and reduced erosion:
		- Case Study 1, Case Study 2.
* **Biodiversity Enhancement:**
	+ Increased biodiversity provides natural pest control and pollination services, reducing the need for chemical inputs.
	+ Economic benefits from cost savings on labor, fertilizers, and other inputs due to enhanced soil health: [verify]

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

* **Overview of Micro-Hydro Technology:**
	+ Explanation of micro-hydro systems and their benefits in providing renewable energy.
	+ Comparison of cost savings from reduced reliance on diesel generators:
		- $10 per day in fuel costs.
* **Energy Savings:**
	+ Examples of successful micro-hydro projects demonstrating improved irrigation efficiency:
		- Pilot Project 1, Pilot Project 2.
		- Increased water delivery to crops due to more efficient pumping systems.
		- Reduced maintenance costs on diesel generators.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

* **Integrated Systems Implementation:**
	+ Description of pilot projects where agroforestry and micro-hydro systems are integrated:
		- Project 1, Project 2.
		- Improved water security demonstrated through increased crop yields.
		- Reduced dependency on external energy sources due to self-sufficient renewable energy supply.
* **Economic Analysis:**
	+ Conduct a cost-benefit analysis showing the cost-effectiveness of these combined solutions:
		- Total savings over five years (including fuel and maintenance costs).

### Policy Recommendations

* **Subsidies and Grants:**
	+ Suggest government subsidies, grants, or low-interest loans to support adoption.
	+ Example project cost breakdown: Initial investment + Subsidy = Total Cost.

### Future Research Directions

* **Long-term Sustainability Assessments:**
	+ Suggest studies on long-term impacts to ensure the sustainability of these integrated systems:
		- 5-year monitoring period for soil health, water retention, and community engagement.
* **Community Engagement Strategies:**
	+ Methods for engaging local communities in planning, implementation, and monitoring phases of these projects.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  **Implement Integrated Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Systems**: Integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance water security and renewable energy use in peri-urban households.
2.  **Develop Community-Based Irrigation Systems**: Develop community-based irrigation systems with local government support to facilitate the implementation of these solutions.
3.  **Provide Subsidies and Grants**: Provide subsidies, grants, or low-interest loans to support adoption and make integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems more accessible.

**Closing Outlook**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical region for addressing climate change impacts in lower-income countries. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for water security and renewable energy use, enhancing the resilience of peri-urban households to climate change.
