# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Harnessing Renewable Energy for Water Security: A Case Study from Sub-Saharan Africa**

**Executive Summary**

Sub-Saharan African countries face significant water scarcity issues exacerbated by climate change, yet they are also rich in renewable energy resources. This brief explores how integrating clean energy solutions can enhance water security and resilience. Through a case study on solar-powered desalination plants, we demonstrate the economic viability and potential for scaling up renewable energy projects to address water security challenges. We highlight common obstacles and propose strategies for overcoming them.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Security and Climate Change**

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to over 40% of the world's freshwater resources, yet millions of people lack access to clean water. Climate change exacerbates this issue through increased evaporation rates, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent droughts. Rising temperatures also increase water demand for agriculture, industry, and domestic use. According to UN Water, climate change impacts on water security are most pronounced in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of the population relies on rain-fed agriculture (1).

**Section 2: Renewable Energy Sources as a Solution**

Sub-Saharan Africa has an abundance of renewable energy resources, including solar, wind, and hydro power. These sources offer a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels and can be integrated into water projects to enhance security and resilience. Case studies from countries like Kenya and Ethiopia demonstrate successful integration of renewable energy in water management:

*   In Kenya's Lake Turkana region, a solar-powered desalination plant provides clean drinking water for over 100,000 people (2).
*   In Ethiopia's Tigray Region, a wind-solar hybrid power plant generates electricity to pump water from the Awash River (3).

**Section 3: Case Study: Solar-Powered Desalination Plants**

Solar-powered desalination plants offer a promising solution for regions facing severe water scarcity. These plants use solar energy to power reverse osmosis or multi-stage flash distillation, producing clean drinking water from seawater or brackish groundwater. In the Gulf of Guinea, a solar-powered desalination plant in Ghana's Western Region provides clean water for over 50,000 people (4). The cost estimates for these projects vary depending on location and technology used.

**Section 4: Economic Viability and Policy Support**

Renewable energy projects for water security can be economically viable when compared to traditional fossil fuels. According to the World Bank, renewable energy investments in Sub-Saharan Africa have increased by 20% between 2015 and 2020 (5). Governments can promote clean energy use through policies and incentives:

*   Tax credits or grants for renewable energy projects
*   Net metering laws allowing households to sell excess energy back to the grid
*   Renewable portfolio standards requiring utilities to generate a certain percentage of electricity from clean sources

**Section 5: Challenges and Solutions**

Implementing renewable energy solutions in water security applications faces several challenges:

*   Financing: High upfront costs for technology and infrastructure
*   Technology access: Limited availability of suitable technologies for local conditions
*   Policy support: Inadequate policies or regulations hindering investment

To overcome these challenges, stakeholders can:

*   Collaborate with international organizations to secure funding and expertise
*   Develop tailored solutions using locally available resources and skills
*   Advocate for supportive policies and regulations at the national and local levels

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  **Invest in renewable energy projects**: Governments and private sector investors should prioritize investments in solar-powered desalination plants and other clean energy solutions.
2.  **Develop supportive policies**: Policymakers should create enabling environments through tax credits, grants, net metering laws, and renewable portfolio standards.
3.  **Enhance technology access**: International organizations can facilitate the transfer of suitable technologies to Sub-Saharan Africa.
4.  **Foster collaboration**: Stakeholders from governments, private sector, and civil society must work together to address water security challenges.

**Closing Outlook**

Harnessing renewable energy for water security is a critical step towards building resilience in lower-income countries. By scaling up solar-powered desalination plants and other clean energy solutions, we can ensure access to clean drinking water for millions of people while mitigating the impacts of climate change.
