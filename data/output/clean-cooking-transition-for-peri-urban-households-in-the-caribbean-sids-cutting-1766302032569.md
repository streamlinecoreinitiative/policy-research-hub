# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Caribbean SIDS: Enhancing Disaster Resilience

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face unique environmental challenges, including water scarcity and climate change impacts. This brief focuses on peri-urban households, which are often vulnerable to disaster losses due to their location between urban and rural areas. The clean cooking transition is a critical aspect of addressing these issues, as it can provide access to cleaner fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges

### Water Security

* **Water scarcity**: Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, affecting agricultural productivity and food security. [Verify]
* **Irrigation challenges**: Existing irrigation systems often rely on non-renewable energy sources, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

### Clean Energy

* **Energy access**: Peri-urban households often lack access to reliable and affordable energy, relying on diesel generators or charcoal for cooking.
* **Renewable energy opportunities**: Micro-hydro systems can provide a clean and efficient source of energy for irrigation and household use.

### Climate Adaptation

* **Climate change impacts**: Rising temperatures and sea levels threaten the livelihoods of peri-urban households, which are often located in low-lying areas.
* **Disaster risk reduction**: The clean cooking transition can help reduce disaster losses by providing access to cleaner fuels and improving air quality.

## Integrated Solutions for Climate Resilience

### Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems

* **Benefits**:
	+ Improved water retention and reduced erosion
	+ Increased energy efficiency and reduced reliance on diesel generators
	+ Enhanced soil health and biodiversity
* **Pilot projects**: Demonstrate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in improving climate resilience.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Support policy frameworks**: Encourage governments to develop policies promoting the adoption of clean cooking technologies.
2. **Invest in infrastructure**: Provide funding for the development and maintenance of micro-hydro systems and other renewable energy infrastructure.
3. **Capacity building**: Support training and capacity-building programs for peri-urban households and local communities.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Conduct socioeconomic studies**: Gather data on community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated solutions.
2. **Develop economic analysis**: Estimate the cost-effectiveness of agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3. **Pilot project implementation**: Implement pilot projects in peri-urban areas to demonstrate the effectiveness of integrated systems.

## Closing Outlook

The clean cooking transition is a critical aspect of addressing environmental resilience challenges in lower-income countries, particularly in peri-urban households. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can provide access to cleaner fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve air quality. With the right policy frameworks, infrastructure investments, and capacity-building programs, we can help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change.
