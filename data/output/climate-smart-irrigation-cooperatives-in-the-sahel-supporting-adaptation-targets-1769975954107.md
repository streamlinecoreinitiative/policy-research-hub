# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sahel: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a key policy intervention. These cooperatives would integrate sustainable water management practices with renewable energy solutions to enhance agricultural productivity while reducing vulnerability to climate-related shocks. By investing in such initiatives, governments can significantly improve livelihoods, build resilient societies, and support the region's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a unique set of challenges related to water security and energy access. The region has seen significant declines in freshwater resources, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. Moreover, just 53.3% of the population has access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023], and renewable energy consumption stands at a mere 19.7% of total final energy consumption [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020]. These statistics underscore the urgent need for policy solutions that address both immediate needs and long-term sustainability.

## Analysis

The region's water scarcity issues are compounded by inefficient water management practices. Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024], while global coverage stands at 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. This stark difference highlights the critical need for improved infrastructure and policies that promote safe water supply. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing temperature variability, leading to reduced freshwater availability through decreased precipitation and increased evaporation rates.

For energy access, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions globally. Only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023], compared to a global average of 91.6% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. Moreover, renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7% of total final energy consumption [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020]. This disparity not only affects daily living conditions but also hinders economic development and climate mitigation efforts.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, governments should prioritize the following policy interventions:

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Invest in robust water infrastructure projects such as rainwater harvesting systems, groundwater recharge schemes, and desalination plants. Implement policies that promote efficient water use through subsidies for low-cost technologies like drip irrigation and provide training on sustainable farming practices.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**: Expand access to renewable energy sources by incentivizing the installation of solar panels in rural areas and implementing feed-in tariffs for small-scale hydroelectric projects. Collaborate with international partners to secure financing for large-scale renewable energy projects.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Encourage communities to adopt climate-resilient practices such as early warning systems, drought-resistant crop varieties, and improved water storage facilities. Provide financial support for vulnerable groups through microfinance institutions and community-based organizations.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these policies will require careful planning and coordination among various stakeholders including government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international development partners, and local communities. Initial investments in infrastructure should be prioritized to ensure immediate benefits while fostering long-term sustainability. Collaborative efforts with regional governments can facilitate knowledge sharing and resource allocation.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation requires a multifaceted approach that integrates technological solutions with socio-economic strategies. By investing in sustainable water management practices and renewable energy sources, Sub-Saharan Africa can build resilience against future challenges while fostering inclusive economic growth. Governments must prioritize these interventions to ensure the region's long-term development.
