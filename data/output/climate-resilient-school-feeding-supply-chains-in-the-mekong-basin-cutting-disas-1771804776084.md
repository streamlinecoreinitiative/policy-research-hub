**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Mekong Basin: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary
To mitigate the devastating impacts of climate-related disasters on school feeding supply chains in the Mekong Basin, we recommend prioritizing investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and renewable energy solutions. Specifically, governments and development partners should:

* Invest [VERIFY] to develop and implement comprehensive water management plans that prioritize the construction of wells, boreholes, and storage facilities for schools.
* Support community-led initiatives for improved sanitation and hygiene practices through grants and technical assistance.

These targeted investments will not only enhance the resilience of school feeding supply chains but also contribute to achieving global climate goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.

## Context & Challenge
The Mekong Basin is one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world, with frequent floods, droughts, and landslides affecting millions of people. The region's school feeding programs are particularly vulnerable to these disasters, which can lead to food shortages, damage to infrastructure, and loss of life.

According to World Bank data (2024), only [32.4%] of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This disparity is exacerbated by inadequate sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices. Climate change intensifies these challenges, increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like floods and droughts.

## Analysis
The analysis reveals that:

* Only [32.4%] of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water [1].
* The region lags behind in accessing modern energy sources, with only [53.3%] of the population having electricity [2].
* Climate change impacts are evident through increased frequency of droughts and floods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**:
	* Develop and implement comprehensive water management plans that prioritize the construction of wells, boreholes, and storage facilities for schools.
	* Support community-led initiatives for improved sanitation and hygiene practices through grants and technical assistance.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Solutions**:
	* Invest in solar-powered water pumping systems to ensure continuous supply during power outages caused by climate-related disruptions.
	* Establish public-private partnerships to finance large-scale renewable energy projects, such as wind and solar farms, to diversify the energy mix.
3. **Strengthen Climate Resilience Measures**:
	* Implement early warning systems for droughts and floods to allow communities to prepare in advance.
	* Encourage climate-resilient agricultural practices that integrate water harvesting techniques, such as rainwater harvesting ponds, to mitigate crop losses during dry periods.

## Implementation Considerations
The estimated cost for implementing comprehensive water security measures ranges from [VERIFY] million to [VERIFY] million per country. Costs for renewable energy projects can vary based on project scale and technology.

Potential challenges include limited financial resources, lack of technical expertise, and resistance to change in traditional practices.

## Conclusion
Building resilient school feeding supply chains requires a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and renewable energy solutions. By focusing on targeted interventions and collaborative efforts, governments can mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and improve the quality of life for millions of people living in the Mekong Basin.
