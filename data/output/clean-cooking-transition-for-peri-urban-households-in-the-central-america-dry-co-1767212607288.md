**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and droughts that significantly impact agriculture and household livelihoods. This brief highlights the importance of transitioning to clean cooking practices for peri-urban households in this region, focusing on the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.

**Addressing Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts**

Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, resulting in significant water scarcity issues. In the Central America dry corridor, average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify]. Existing irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, losing a significant amount of water due to evaporation and seepage.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

• Soil organic matter increases by 2-8% [verify]
• Biodiversity increase is reported in various studies, but specific numbers are not provided
• Carbon sequestration rates vary widely depending on factors such as tree species and management practices

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy. Energy efficiency ranges from 70-80% [verify]. Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods are significant, but specific numbers are not provided.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects provide cost-effective solutions. Total project costs range from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare [verify]. Return on investment (ROI) is reported to be 3-5 years, but this claim requires further evidence.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the transition to clean cooking practices and climate-resilient irrigation:

• Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
• Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
• Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research directions include assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  **Develop policy frameworks**: Governments should establish policies to support the transition to clean cooking practices and climate-resilient irrigation.
2.  **Invest in infrastructure development**: Infrastructure development, such as roads and storage facilities, is crucial for the successful implementation of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Promote community engagement**: Engage with local communities to assess their needs and preferences regarding clean cooking practices and climate-resilient irrigation.

**Closing Outlook**

The Central America dry corridor faces significant challenges related to water scarcity and climate change impacts. Transitioning to clean cooking practices and integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation can provide a sustainable solution to these issues. By implementing policy recommendations and investing in infrastructure development, we can protect livelihoods under climate stress and contribute to broader sustainable development goals.
