# Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Great Lakes Region: Improving Health Outcomes During Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region is particularly vulnerable to heatwaves due to its geography and climate. The impact of these events on human health, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children, is significant. Traditional transport corridors often exacerbate this vulnerability by being poorly designed or maintained, leading to increased exposure to extreme temperatures. This brief proposes integrating flood-resilient design principles into transport corridor infrastructure in the Great Lakes region to improve health outcomes during heatwaves.

## Introduction

The Great Lakes region faces unique challenges when it comes to climate change and its effects on human health. Heatwaves are becoming more frequent due to rising temperatures, posing a significant risk to commuters' health. Traditional transport corridors often lack necessary design features to mitigate these impacts, putting commuters at risk of heat-related illnesses.

### Current Challenges

- **Heatwave Frequency:** Rising temperatures are leading to more frequent heatwaves.
- **Transport Corridor Design:** Traditional design often prioritizes speed over safety, leaving commuters exposed during extreme weather events.
- **Health Impacts:** Heat-related illnesses can have long-term health consequences for vulnerable populations.

### Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors

- **Design Principles:**
  - Integration of green infrastructure (e.g., parks, green roofs) to mitigate urban heat island effect
  - Use of materials that reduce heat absorption and improve cooling efficiency
  - Design of corridors to maximize shade and minimize exposure to direct sunlight
- **Implementation Strategies:** Collaboration between local governments, transportation agencies, and community groups for planning and implementation

### Benefits

- **Improved Health Outcomes:** Reduced exposure to extreme temperatures leads to fewer heat-related illnesses.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Green infrastructure can reduce urban heat island effect, improving overall efficiency of transport corridors.
- **Enhanced Resilience:** Flood-resilient design ensures that transport corridors remain operational during extreme weather events.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Incorporate Flood-Resilient Design Principles:** Update transportation planning guidelines to include flood-resilient design principles.
2.  **Increase Community Engagement:** Engage with local communities in the planning and implementation of flood-resilient transport corridors.
3.  **Provide Funding Support:** Allocate funds for infrastructure upgrades that incorporate flood-resilient design principles.

## Closing Outlook

Implementing flood-resilient transport corridor infrastructure in the Great Lakes region is crucial for improving health outcomes during heatwaves. By integrating green infrastructure, reducing heat absorption, and maximizing shade, these corridors can reduce exposure to extreme temperatures. Collaboration between local governments, transportation agencies, and community groups is essential for successful implementation.
