**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy, expanding access to clean cooking solutions, and implementing climate-resilient infrastructure projects.

* Expand access to clean cooking solutions by providing subsidies or grants for low-income households to transition from traditional fuels like wood to cleaner alternatives such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or biogas digesters.
* Increase renewable energy deployment in Sub-Saharan Africa through concessional loans and grants that incentivize private sector investment in clean energy infrastructure.
* Enhance climate-resilient water management by investing in early warning systems, flood control measures, and the construction of water storage facilities.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face critical challenges related to environmental resilience. According to World Bank data, 32.4% of people in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to safely managed drinking water, compared to [VERIFY] globally (World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates these vulnerabilities, with droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events becoming more frequent.

Climate change also affects energy access. In Sub-Saharan Africa, electricity access declined from 53.3% in 2020 to [VERIFY] in 2023 (World Bank Open Data), highlighting the need for increased investment in renewable energy.

## Analysis

The current challenges facing lower-income countries are:

* **Access to safe drinking water and sanitation**: Insufficient access, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.
* **Renewable energy consumption**: Low at [VERIFY]% of total final energy consumption (TFEC) globally (World Bank Open Data), underscoring the need for increased investment.
* **Climate change impacts**: Severe droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events have become more frequent.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand access to clean cooking solutions**:
	* Implement subsidies or grants for low-income households to transition from traditional fuels like wood to cleaner alternatives such as LPG or biogas digesters.

2. **Increase renewable energy deployment**:
	* Target Sub-Saharan Africa for significant growth in solar and wind power projects.
	* Provide concessional loans and grants to incentivize private sector investment in clean energy infrastructure.

3. **Enhance climate-resilient water management**:
	* Invest in early warning systems, flood control measures, and the construction of water storage facilities to mitigate impacts from seasonal variations.

## Implementation Considerations

Practical steps:

* Establish public-private partnerships for renewable energy projects and clean cooking solutions.
* Develop training programs to educate communities on climate-resilient farming practices.

Costs:

* Subsidies or grants for clean cookstoves: $10-$50 per household (Source: World Bank)
* Concessional loans for renewable energy projects: [VERIFY] over five years (Source: UN Environment)

Potential barriers:

* Political resistance to new policies and funding.
* Limited infrastructure in rural areas.

## Conclusion

Immediate steps are needed to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Decision-makers must prioritize these interventions within their budgets while considering political landscapes and institutional constraints. We urge governments, international organizations, and development partners to work together to develop comprehensive strategies with clear timelines and dedicated funding mechanisms for implementation.

Next steps include:

* Developing a global framework for water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation.
* Establishing partnerships between governments, private sector companies, and civil society organizations to support the transition to renewable energy and improve access to clean cooking solutions.
* Providing technical assistance and capacity-building programs to help lower-income countries develop their own strategies and implement climate-resilient infrastructure projects.

By taking these steps, we can enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries and ensure a more sustainable future for all.
