# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Sahel: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Renewing Water Security, Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

The urgent need to improve water security in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot be overstated. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), compared to the world average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data), governments must prioritize investments in water infrastructure and clean energy solutions. This policy brief recommends investing $1 billion over the next five years in desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and improved sanitation facilities to ensure a reliable supply of safe drinking water. Additionally, we recommend promoting solar-powered irrigation systems and mini-grids to provide access to electricity for off-grid communities.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water and electricity. Over 50% of the population lacks access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), leading to poor health outcomes and economic instability. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing variability in rainfall patterns and temperatures, further straining already limited resources.

## Analysis

Despite progress towards achieving SDG 6 goals, only 74% global coverage for safely managed water has been achieved (UN SDG Report 2023). Factors contributing to the challenge include limited infrastructure, political instability, and insufficient investment in clean energy solutions. The impact of poor access to safe drinking water and electricity is far-reaching, straining healthcare systems, reducing agricultural productivity, and hindering economic growth.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Investment in Water Security**:
	* Construct desalination plants in coastal areas where seawater can be used for irrigation.
	* Implement rainwater harvesting projects to capture and store water during rainy seasons, ensuring a reliable supply throughout the year.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Solutions**:
	* Deploy solar-powered pumps in rural areas where conventional diesel-powered systems are inefficient and costly.
	* Develop mini-grids for off-grid communities, providing access to electricity without high upfront costs.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Introduce drought-resistant crop varieties suitable for the region’s climate conditions.
	* Establish early warning systems for floods and droughts to mitigate their impact on agriculture and water resources.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in infrastructure will be substantial, but can be offset by long-term savings from reduced healthcare costs due to improved sanitation and increased agricultural productivity. Potential barriers include political opposition, lack of funding, technical expertise, and community resistance. Collaboration with local communities and NGOs is crucial for successful deployment.

## Conclusion

To build a resilient future, Sub-Saharan African governments must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy solutions, and climate adaptation measures. By doing so, they can ensure sustainable development while improving the quality of life for millions of people. We urge governments to invest $1 billion over the next five years in desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and improved sanitation facilities to ensure a reliable supply of safe drinking water.
