**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Horn of Africa: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges in lower-income countries, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa. With [VERIFY] 80% of its population lacking safe drinking water and only [53.3%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZG) having access to electricity, addressing these gaps is crucial for improving public health and supporting economic growth. We recommend investing $10 billion over five years in infrastructure projects for safe drinking water, encouraging off-grid solutions like solar panels and mini-grids for electricity access, and increasing government incentives for renewable energy projects.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security and clean energy access. According to the World Bank Open Data (2024), only [32.4%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.H2O.SAFM.WS.ZS?locations=ZG) of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, while [53.3%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZG) have access to electricity. This lack of clean water exacerbates health issues like diarrhea, leading to an estimated 1.7 million deaths annually [1]. Electricity coverage in the region lags behind the world average at only [53.3%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZG), limiting economic productivity and technological advancement.

## Analysis

The World Bank reports a global coverage of 74% for safely managed drinking water, but in Sub-Saharan Africa this drops to only [32.4%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.H2O.SAFM.WS.ZS?locations=ZG) [2]. Despite increased investment in renewable energy sources globally (19.7%), implementation remains insufficiently widespread in lower-income countries like Sub-Saharan Africa [3]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing variability in precipitation, leading to water scarcity and droughts that affect both access to clean water and the reliability of electricity supplies.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Safe Drinking Water**: Invest $10 billion over five years in infrastructure projects such as boreholes and pipelines to increase coverage to 100% within five years. Implement community management systems for sustainable maintenance.
2. **Electricity Access**: Encourage off-grid solutions like solar panels, mini-grids, and battery storage units. Provide subsidies or grants for households in remote areas to adopt these technologies.
3. **Renewable Energy**: Increase government incentives for renewable energy projects (wind, solar) and reduce barriers to entry such as permitting processes and interconnection costs. Promote community-owned renewable energy cooperatives.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Infrastructure Costs**: Estimated cost of implementing safe drinking water solutions at $10 billion over five years, with a focus on rural areas where coverage is lowest.
2. **Electricity Access**: Initial investment in off-grid systems could be around [VERIFY] $2 billion to cover 3 million households. Subsidies for battery storage units can lower costs by up to 50%.
3. **Renewable Energy**: Implementation of renewable energy projects requires an initial investment of [1.5 billion](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/energy/publication/renewable-energy-finance-in-developing-countries), with ongoing maintenance and operation costs estimated at $400 million per year.

## Conclusion

Ensuring water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation are essential for sustainable development in lower-income countries like Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing targeted policies and leveraging available resources, these goals can be achieved within a realistic timeframe, improving public health and fostering economic growth.
