# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Food Security During Droughts**

### Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces significant challenges in maintaining food security during droughts, exacerbated by climate change-induced water scarcity. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in lower-income countries, with a focus on the Ethiopian Highlands as a model case study.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change impacts agriculture by causing erratic rainfall patterns, leading to severe water scarcity in regions such as the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta and the Ethiopian Highlands. [Verify] The average annual rainfall in these areas is approximately 800-1200 mm (NOAA climate dataset).

### Current Irrigation Practices

Traditional irrigation practices in these regions are often unsustainable and inefficient. Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy, while canal systems experience substantial losses through evaporation and seepage.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Local surveys and case studies have demonstrated that agroforestry can increase soil organic matter by 2-8% [verify] and biodiversity by 15-30 native species.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy for irrigation. These systems generate power ranging from 10-50 kW per system, with an energy efficiency of 70-80%. Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods make micro-hydro systems an attractive solution.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide a cost-effective solution for climate-resilient water supply. The total project cost per hectare is estimated to be $10,000-$25,000 [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Subsidies for farmers, grid integration, and infrastructure development are essential components of a comprehensive policy framework.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct local surveys and case studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop economic analyses of traditional irrigation costs and micro-hydro system costs.
3. Establish subsidies for farmers to encourage adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
4. Integrate micro-hydro systems into the grid to enhance reliability and efficiency.

### Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for addressing water scarcity in lower-income countries. By stabilizing food security during droughts, these systems can help ensure a stable food supply and support sustainable development goals. Further research and policy measures are necessary to promote the adoption of these innovative solutions.
