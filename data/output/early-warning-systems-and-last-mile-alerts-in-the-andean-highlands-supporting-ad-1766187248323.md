**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Andean highlands are among the most vulnerable regions to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts, floods, and landslides that affect agriculture, water security, and human settlements. This brief highlights the importance of early-warning systems and last-mile alerts for supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into climate-resilient irrigation practices, communities can enhance their resilience to climate-related shocks.

**Climate Change Impacts on Water Security in the Andean Highlands**

The Andean highlands face severe water scarcity due to climate change, including rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns. Rising sea levels and increased salinity intrusion threaten agricultural productivity, food security, and economic stability for already vulnerable communities. The region's traditional irrigation methods exacerbate these challenges by being energy-intensive and costly.

* Climate change impacts on agriculture in the Andean highlands:
	+ Rising temperatures: [verify] temperature increase since 1960
	+ Altered precipitation patterns: changes in rainfall distribution and frequency
	+ Increased evaporation rates due to warmer temperatures
* Importance of resilient irrigation methods for food security and economic stability:
	+ Irrigation accounts for a significant portion of water usage in agriculture (exact percentage not specified)
	+ Climate-resilient irrigation practices can reduce crop losses

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Sustainable Solution**

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. When integrated with micro-hydro technology, these systems provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

* Benefits of agroforestry:
	+ Improved water retention and reduced erosion
	+ Enhanced soil fertility and increased crop yields
	+ Biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services
* Micro-hydro technology benefits:
	+ Reduced reliance on diesel generators and increased energy efficiency
	+ Low operational costs and minimal environmental impact

**Pilot Projects and Policy Recommendations**

Several pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in improving water security and renewable energy use. These projects can serve as models for scaling up climate-resilient irrigation practices.

* Pilot project examples:
	+ [Insert specific project names and locations]
	+ Economic analysis showing cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up
* Policy recommendations to support adoption of these systems at scale:
	+ Develop and implement policies supporting agroforestry-based micro-hydro projects
	+ Provide incentives for communities to adopt climate-resilient irrigation practices
	+ Enhance capacity building and technical assistance for project implementation

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop and implement policies supporting agroforestry-based micro-hydro projects**
2. **Provide incentives for communities to adopt climate-resilient irrigation practices**
3. **Enhance capacity building and technical assistance for project implementation**
4. **Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and long-term sustainability**

**Closing Outlook**

The Andean highlands face significant climate-related challenges that require innovative solutions. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into climate-resilient irrigation practices, communities can enhance their resilience to climate-related shocks. This brief highlights the importance of early-warning systems and last-mile alerts for supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.
