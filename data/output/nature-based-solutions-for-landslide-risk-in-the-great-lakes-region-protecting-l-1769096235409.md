**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Great Lakes Region: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face severe water security and energy access challenges that exacerbate climate vulnerability. To address these issues, we recommend implementing targeted policies and investments in water infrastructure, renewable energy sources, and climate adaptation measures to improve water access rates (32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa) and electricity access (53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa). Effective interventions can lead to significant improvements in livelihoods and resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries often face critical gaps in access to safe drinking water and reliable electricity, which are fundamental for sustaining health, education, and economic activities. These challenges intensify under a changing climate, increasing vulnerability to droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events (World Bank Open Data). In the Great Lakes region, landslides pose significant risks to communities, infrastructure, and livelihoods.

## Analysis

Evidence-based examination of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries reveals:

*   **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa's water access rate is much lower than the global average (32.4% vs. 73.7%), indicating a significant gap that needs immediate attention (World Bank Open Data).
*   **Clean Energy Access**: The region lags behind globally in electricity access, with only 53.3% of its population having access compared to 91.6% worldwide (World Bank Open Data). This disparity is even more pronounced when considering renewable energy consumption, which stands at only [VERIFY] 4.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa versus the global average of 19.7%.
*   **Climate Adaptation**: The region's climate resilience remains fragile due to inadequate infrastructure and resources for water management and power generation (World Bank Open Data). Extreme weather events are on the rise, posing severe threats to both human health and economic stability.

## Policy Recommendations

### Water Security

1.  Invest in rural water supply systems: Develop and implement sustainable water harvesting and distribution projects in underserved areas.
2.  Promote community-led initiatives: Empower local communities by providing training and resources for managing water sources effectively.

### Clean Energy Access

1.  Expand renewable energy deployment: Increase access to solar, wind, and hydroelectric power through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and government subsidies.
2.  Enhance grid resilience: Implement smart grids and improve infrastructure to ensure reliable electricity supply during peak demand periods.

### Climate Adaptation

1.  Strengthen early warning systems: Establish comprehensive climate monitoring networks that provide timely alerts for extreme weather events, enabling effective mitigation strategies.
2.  Support ecosystem-based adaptation: Protect critical natural resources such as forests, wetlands, and mangroves that serve as vital buffers against climate impacts.

## Implementation Considerations

Practical steps include:

*   Engage with local stakeholders to ensure projects are culturally relevant and sustainable.
*   Collaborate with international organizations for financial support and technical expertise.

Initial investments will be substantial, but the long-term benefits in terms of health, education, and economic growth justify such expenditures (World Bank Open Data).

## Conclusion

Decision-makers must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation as critical components of sustainable development strategies. Early and sustained efforts can significantly improve living conditions for millions of vulnerable individuals.
