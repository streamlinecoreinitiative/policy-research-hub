# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Enhancing Water Security, Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in watershed co-management with indigenous councils to enhance water security, promote clean energy access, and bolster climate adaptation measures. This approach has been shown to be effective in improving water management practices while reducing emissions from critical sectors (World Bank Open Data, 2024). We urge governments and stakeholders to prioritize this strategy, allocating resources towards infrastructure projects that support safe drinking water access, renewable energy generation, and climate-resilient water management.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water ([VERIFY] 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water) and electricity (53.3% of the population lacks access to electricity) [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. Climate change exacerbates these issues, with droughts and floods becoming more frequent (World Meteorological Organization, 2022). The region's reliance on non-renewable energy sources poses environmental risks, while inadequate water management systems contribute to health issues (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, 2022).

## Analysis

### Water Security
Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world in terms of safe drinking water access ([VERIFY] 32.4% vs [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]). The region's limited resources for water treatment and infrastructure contribute to unsafe water sources, leading to poor health outcomes (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, 2022).

### Clean Energy Access
Only [VERIFY] 53.3% of the population has access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa, far behind the global average ([Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]). This disparity increases vulnerability during extreme weather events and hinders economic development.

### Climate Adaptation
Climate change impacts are evident through increased frequency of droughts and floods. Without resilient water management systems and clean energy solutions, communities face heightened risks to their livelihoods.

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance water security, promote clean energy access, and bolster climate resilience, consider the following:

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
   - Invest in infrastructure projects like wells and boreholes for safe drinking water.
   - Implement community-driven initiatives focused on hygiene education and proper water storage facilities.

2. **Expand Renewable Energy Access**:
   - Promote solar-powered irrigation systems to increase agricultural productivity sustainably.
   - Encourage small-scale renewable energy generation through subsidies or grants for households and businesses.

3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Measures**:
   - Develop early-warning systems for extreme weather events, ensuring timely responses.
   - Implement climate-resilient water management practices that integrate traditional knowledge with modern technologies.

## Implementation Considerations

- Budget allocation will be crucial to fund these initiatives effectively.
- Collaboration between government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is essential for project implementation and monitoring.
- Public-private partnerships can leverage resources efficiently while ensuring sustainability over the long term.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, promoting clean energy access, and strengthening climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa are critical steps towards sustainable development. By implementing these recommendations, governments and stakeholders can create a future where communities thrive despite environmental challenges. We urge policymakers to prioritize watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a key strategy for achieving these goals.
