**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to invest in mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, a region highly vulnerable to climate change. With only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), addressing water security is essential. Furthermore, the region's renewable energy consumption stands at just 53.3%, far below global averages (19.7%) [VERIFY]. To support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and enhance climate resilience, governments should prioritize investments in clean energy projects, implement sustainable irrigation systems, and develop early warning systems for climate events.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 12% of the global population but struggles with limited access to essential resources like safe drinking water (32.4%) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and reliable electricity (53.3%) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. These deficits not only affect public health and economic productivity but also exacerbate the impacts of climate change, where droughts and floods are becoming more frequent and severe.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water. According to World Bank data (2024), only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data]. This disparity is exacerbated by factors such as inadequate sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices.
- **Clean Energy**: The region's renewable energy consumption stands at just 53.3%, far below global averages (19.7%) [VERIFY]. This gap highlights the need for increased investment in solar, wind, and hydro power to meet growing demand without further degrading natural resources.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts are already evident in Sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, droughts have become more frequent, affecting agricultural productivity and water supplies. Floods also threaten infrastructure and public health.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Clean Energy Projects**: Governments should prioritize renewable energy investments to increase access to electricity. This includes developing solar power plants and expanding grid connectivity, supported by grants and subsidies for small-scale projects.
2. **Implement Sustainable Irrigation Systems**: Promote the adoption of drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems that conserve water resources and enhance agricultural productivity in arid regions.
3. **Develop Early Warning Systems**: Establish early warning systems for climate events like droughts and floods to provide timely alerts, enabling communities to take protective measures.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Initial investments in clean energy projects can be high but yield long-term benefits through reduced dependency on fossil fuels and improved public health outcomes.
- **Barriers**: Limited financial resources and technical expertise pose significant challenges. Collaboration with international partners, NGOs, and local communities is essential to overcome these obstacles.

## Conclusion

Ensuring water security, promoting clean energy access, and enhancing climate resilience are crucial for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing the recommended policies, governments can create a more resilient future for their populations while contributing positively to global environmental goals.

### Background Information

**Environment**

The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally, including physical and biological factors along with their chemical interactions that impact on any organism or a group of organisms (Wikipedia).

**Resilience**

Resilience refers to the capacity to withstand or recover from difficult conditions. It can be applied to various contexts, including environmental systems and human societies (Wikipedia).
