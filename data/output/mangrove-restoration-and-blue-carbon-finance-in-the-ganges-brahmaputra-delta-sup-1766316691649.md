**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including rising sea levels, increased flooding, and saltwater intrusion. Mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance can provide a vital adaptation strategy for this region, supporting the achievement of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

### Introduction

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical ecosystem providing essential services such as coastal protection, fisheries, and water filtration. Climate change is exacerbating existing pressures on this ecosystem, including:

* Rising sea levels: [verify] (IPCC, 2019)
* Increased flooding: [verify] (UNDP, 2020)
* Saltwater intrusion: [verify] (FAO, 2018)

Mangrove restoration can help mitigate these impacts by reducing coastal erosion and flooding, enhancing fisheries and biodiversity, and improving water quality.

### Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance

Blue carbon finance refers to the monetization of ecosystem services provided by mangroves and other coastal ecosystems. This can include:

* Carbon sequestration: [verify] (UNEP, 2016)
* Coastal protection: [verify] (World Bank, 2020)

### Policy Recommendations

To scale up mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta:

1. **Establish a national mangrove restoration program**: Develop a coordinated effort to restore mangroves.
2. **Develop a blue carbon finance mechanism**: Establish a framework for monetizing ecosystem services provided by mangroves and other coastal ecosystems.
3. **Provide incentives for communities and governments**: Offer financial and technical support for conservation and restoration activities.

### Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta's mangrove forests, including mapping and monitoring efforts.
2. Develop a blue carbon finance framework, including mechanisms for monetizing ecosystem services and providing incentives for communities and governments.
3. Establish a national mangrove restoration program with clear targets and timelines.

### Closing Outlook

Mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance can provide a vital adaptation strategy for the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, supporting the achievement of NDCs under the Paris Agreement. With coordinated effort and investment from governments, communities, and international partners, it is possible to restore mangroves and protect the livelihoods of millions.
