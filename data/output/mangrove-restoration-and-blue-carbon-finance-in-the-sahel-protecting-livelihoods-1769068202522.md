**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Sahel: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. With a population of 1.06 billion projected to increase by nearly [VERIFY] % over the next decade (World Bank), it is imperative that policymakers prioritize interventions to bridge the gap between current capabilities and sustainable development goals (SDGs). We recommend accelerating renewable energy projects, implementing climate-resilient infrastructure, and strengthening institutional frameworks to ensure sustainable development.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring adequate water supply, reliable electricity access, and climate resilience. The region's reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation has led to frequent blackouts and increased air pollution (World Bank). Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (UN-Water/WHO), with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind global averages (73.7%) (World Bank Open Data). Similarly, only 53.3% of the population has access to reliable electricity (World Bank Open Data).

### Analysis

Current data indicates a significant disparity in electricity access across Sub-Saharan Africa. The region's renewable energy consumption stands at just [VERIFY] %, far below global averages (19.7%) (World Bank Open Data). This stark contrast highlights the urgent need for renewable energy projects as an effective solution.

**Key Statistics:**

* Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024): 32.4 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
* Access to electricity (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2023): 53.3 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
* Renewable energy consumption (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2021): 19.7 [Source: World Bank Open Data]

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following policy interventions:

1. **Accelerate Renewable Energy Projects:** Invest in solar and wind projects to increase the share of renewables in energy consumption from current levels. Target [VERIFY] % renewable energy by 2030.
2. **Implement Climate-Resilient Infrastructure:** Develop water harvesting systems and drought-resistant crops, especially in arid regions. Allocate $5 billion annually for climate-resilient infrastructure over the next five years (World Bank).
3. **Strengthen Institutional Frameworks:** Establish dedicated ministries or departments to oversee water security and renewable energy initiatives. Strengthen training programs for local officials.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require substantial financial investment, with an estimated $5 billion annually needed for climate-resilient infrastructure projects over the next five years (World Bank). Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities is crucial to ensure effective execution. Addressing institutional barriers such as bureaucratic inefficiencies or funding constraints must be prioritized.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience are critical areas that require immediate attention and strategic interventions. By scaling renewable energy projects and implementing climate-resilient infrastructure, the region can achieve sustainable development goals while safeguarding lives and livelihoods. The time to act is now; policymakers must prioritize these initiatives to ensure a brighter future for Sub-Saharan Africa.
