**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, one of the world's most densely populated regions, is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Rising sea levels, increased flooding, and saltwater intrusion threaten the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on agriculture, fishing, and other water-based activities. This brief highlights the importance of early-warning systems (EWS) and last-mile alerts in supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By integrating climate-resilient water management practices with EWS and last-mile alert systems, communities can better prepare for and respond to climate-related disasters.

### Current Water Security Challenges in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces severe water scarcity due to:

*   **Climate Change Impacts:** Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events.
*   **Water Pollution:** Agricultural runoff, industrial effluent, and domestic waste contaminate surface and groundwater sources.
*   **Inadequate Infrastructure:** Insufficient irrigation systems, canals, and water storage facilities exacerbate water scarcity.

### Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. When combined with micro-hydro technology, these practices can:

*   **Enhance Water Retention:** Agroforestry systems reduce runoff and increase water retention in soils.
*   **Increase Energy Efficiency:** Micro-hydro systems reduce reliance on diesel generators.

### Early-Warning Systems (EWS) and Last-Mile Alerts

Effective EWS and last-mile alert systems can:

*   **Predict Extreme Events:** Monitor climate indicators, such as precipitation, temperature, and sea level rise.
*   **Trigger Alert Mechanisms:** Send timely warnings to communities via mobile phones, radio broadcasts, or other communication channels.
*   **Support Climate-Resilient Decision-Making:** Enable farmers, fishermen, and other water-dependent stakeholders to adapt their practices in response to climate-related events.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  Integrate EWS and last-mile alert systems with agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems to support climate-resilient irrigation.
2.  Develop and disseminate climate-resilient water management guidelines for farmers, fishermen, and other stakeholders.
3.  Establish a regional climate information platform to provide timely and accurate climate forecasts.
4.  Support policy reforms that prioritize climate-resilient water management practices and EWS development.

### Closing Outlook

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is facing unprecedented climate-related challenges. By integrating early-warning systems, last-mile alerts, and agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, communities can enhance their resilience to climate change impacts. This brief highlights the importance of supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs through integrated climate-resilient water management practices.
