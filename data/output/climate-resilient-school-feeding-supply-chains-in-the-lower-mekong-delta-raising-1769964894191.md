**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Lower Mekong Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water security and energy access challenges, with less than 30% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water. Only about half of its population has access to electricity. These issues not only threaten health and economic stability but also exacerbate climate change impacts. To address these challenges, we recommend implementing solar-powered desalination plants, enhancing renewable energy infrastructure, and developing climate-resilient irrigation systems.

**Key Recommendations:**

* Install solar-powered desalination plants in arid regions to increase access to clean water.
* Invest in renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar power stations to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
* Develop and implement climate-resilient irrigation systems that are water-efficient, drought-resistant, and can withstand extreme weather events.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to water scarcity and energy poverty. Climate change intensifies these challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and power outages. Without intervention, this situation will worsen health outcomes and economic stability.

### Background on the Issue:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)].
* Access to electricity stands at 53.3% in the region [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)].
* The global population lacking safe water is approximately 2.2 billion people [Source: UN-Water/WHO (2022)].

### Why it Matters Now:

Climate change exacerbates these challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and power outages. Without intervention, this situation will worsen health outcomes and economic stability.

## Analysis

Evidence-based examination of the issue reveals significant gaps in current strategies.

* Limited water supply increases morbidity rates due to contaminated water sources, particularly for vulnerable populations like children under five years old.
* Energy poverty hinders economic productivity and exacerbates food insecurity during droughts.
* Current strategies often fail to address the scale of these issues efficiently and effectively.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Solar-Powered Desalination Plants**: Install solar-powered desalination plants in arid regions where access to clean water is critical for health and economic development [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)].
2. **Renewable Energy Infrastructure**: Invest in renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar power stations to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and increase electricity generation capacity [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)]. This would also help meet the SDG target of increasing access to clean cooking facilities.
3. **Climate-Resilient Irrigation Systems**: Develop and implement climate-resilient irrigation systems that are water-efficient, drought-resistant, and can withstand extreme weather events [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)].

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Initial investment for solar-powered desalination plants and renewable energy infrastructure is substantial but justified by long-term benefits.
* Potential Barriers: Political resistance to new technology adoption; lack of skilled labor required for maintenance. Address these through public-private partnerships and capacity building programs.

## Conclusion

By implementing the recommended strategies, Sub-Saharan Africa can significantly improve water security, enhance access to clean energy, and bolster climate adaptation efforts. This not only addresses immediate needs but also lays a foundation for sustained economic growth and improved health outcomes in future generations.
