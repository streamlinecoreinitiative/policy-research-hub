**Improving Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Dual Focus on Renewable Energy and Safe Drinking Water**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [Source: World Bank Open Data] and a mere 53.3% with access to electricity (World Bank, 2023) [Source: World Bank Open Data], urgent action is needed to improve these critical areas. This policy brief recommends prioritizing renewable energy projects, investing in safe drinking water infrastructure, and implementing climate adaptation measures.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to one-third of the world's population lacking access to safe drinking water (2.2 billion people) [Source: UN-Water/WHO] and electricity (53.3%) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges through droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall patterns (UN Climate Change Adaptation Reports, 2023). Ensuring sustainable water security and clean energy is crucial for economic development, public health, and social stability in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only about 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. This lack of basic sanitation facilities leads to health issues and economic losses. In contrast, the global average for safely managed drinking water is 73.7% (World Bank, 2024) [Source: World Bank Open Data].

### Clean Energy Access

The region's electricity access rate is just 53.3%, with renewable energy consumption at only 19.7% of total final energy consumption (World Bank, 2020). These low figures highlight the significant challenges in meeting basic needs through clean and sustainable means.

### Climate Adaptation

Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. Climate-resilient infrastructure and renewable energy sources are essential for reducing vulnerability.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Projects**:
	* Objective: Increase the percentage of renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa.
	* Actions: Invest in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation projects, particularly in rural areas where access is limited.
	* Sources: World Bank Renewable Energy Data (2024)
2. **Safe Drinking Water Infrastructure**:
	* Objective: Expand access to safely managed drinking water through improved sanitation facilities and clean water sources.
	* Actions: Implement large-scale water treatment plants, improve rural piped water systems, and promote community-managed wells.
	* Sources: World Bank Access to Safe Drinking Water Data (2024)
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Objective: Enhance resilience against climate change impacts by building infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events.
	* Actions: Develop early-warning systems, construct flood-resistant buildings, and implement water storage solutions in vulnerable regions.
	* Sources: UN Climate Change Adaptation Reports (2023)

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments for renewable energy projects range from $5 million to $10 million per project [VERIFY]. Safe drinking water infrastructure requires an average of $1 million per village. Limited financial resources, lack of technical expertise, and political instability can hinder implementation.

## Conclusion

To build a more resilient future for Sub-Saharan Africa, it is essential to prioritize renewable energy projects, safe drinking water infrastructure, and climate adaptation measures. By doing so, we can improve access to basic needs while reducing vulnerability to climate change impacts. Let us take action now to ensure sustainable development in the region.
