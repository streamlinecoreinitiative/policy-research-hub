# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy Adoption, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes investments in renewable energy, climate adaptation strategies, and improved water supply systems. Specifically, governments should invest in building and maintaining rainwater harvesting facilities, groundwater wells, and desalination plants where feasible. Additionally, they should promote the use of solar-powered pumps and other renewable energy technologies for water pumping and irrigation, while implementing subsidies or grants to make these technologies more affordable and accessible.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally due to its reliance on natural resources that are increasingly threatened by climate change. Water scarcity affects about [VERIFY] million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, leading to health issues, economic losses, and social unrest (World Bank Open Data). Only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity, limiting opportunities for sustainable development (World Bank Open Data). Climate variability exacerbates these challenges, making it imperative to develop robust strategies that ensure water security, promote clean energy adoption, and enhance resilience against climate shocks.

## Analysis

The region's limited access to safe drinking water underscores the critical need for improved infrastructure and policies. For instance, Nigeria’s Access to Electricity Project aims to reduce power outages by [NEEDS SOURCE] over five years, with significant potential impacts on health outcomes and economic productivity. However, achieving universal access will require substantial investment in renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Currently, only about 19.7% of the world's final energy consumption comes from renewables, highlighting a need for accelerated adoption (World Bank Open Data).

Moreover, climate change intensifies these challenges by causing irregular rainfall patterns and more frequent droughts and floods. Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to temperature increases and changing precipitation patterns, which threaten agricultural productivity, water availability, and overall food security. For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that Sub-Saharan Africa will experience more extreme weather events by 2050, further complicating efforts to improve water security and energy access.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Water Supply Systems**: Invest in building and maintaining rainwater harvesting facilities, groundwater wells, and desalination plants where feasible. Governments should collaborate with NGOs and international organizations to ensure equitable distribution of resources.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the use of solar-powered pumps and other renewable energy technologies for water pumping and irrigation. Implement subsidies or grants to make these technologies more affordable and accessible.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Measures**: Develop early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events. Support smallholder farmers in adopting climate-resilient practices such as crop diversification and improved land management techniques.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Initial investments will be substantial but payoffs are significant through reduced health costs, increased economic productivity, and enhanced food security.
- **Barriers**: Potential challenges include high initial costs, lack of technical expertise, and resistance to change. Overcoming these requires comprehensive training programs, community engagement initiatives, and supportive government policies.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy adoption, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for sustainable development. By implementing the recommended strategies, governments can create a more resilient future where communities have access to safe drinking water and reliable energy sources, even under changing climatic conditions.

**Key Data Points:**

- **Sub-Saharan Africa**: 53.3% of population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).
- **Global Renewable Energy Consumption**: About 19.7% comes from renewables (World Bank Open Data).
