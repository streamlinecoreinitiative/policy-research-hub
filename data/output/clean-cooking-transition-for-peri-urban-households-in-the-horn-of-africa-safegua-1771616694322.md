# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Horn of Africa: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Immediate action is required to address significant gaps in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa. With less than 40% of the region's population having access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) [1] and only about half having electricity (53.3%), these sectors are critical areas for intervention [2]. We recommend implementing sustainable water management practices, increasing renewable energy use through public-private partnerships, and enhancing early warning systems to mitigate climate impacts.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in providing access to safe drinking water and electricity. Despite progress in extending grid access, many communities rely on unsafe drinking water sources (47.6% of the population uses contaminated water) [1]. Climate change intensifies existing vulnerabilities, necessitating robust adaptation measures such as early warning systems for droughts and heatwaves.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Despite progress in extending grid access, many communities rely on unsafe drinking water sources (47.6% of the population uses contaminated water) [1]. This poses significant health risks, especially among vulnerable groups like children. Rainwater harvesting and micro-dams can ensure sustainable water resources.

### Clean Energy

Low renewable energy consumption (<20%) indicates a strong potential for growth [3]. Public support and private investments are crucial to accelerate this transition through solar power plants and wind farms, leveraging government grants and subsidies.

### Climate Adaptation

Enhanced early warning systems can save lives by providing timely alerts on climate events (droughts, heatwaves) [1]. This is particularly important given the region's high vulnerability. Investing in infrastructure like weather stations and communication networks will improve climate alert systems.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Management Practices**: Promote rainwater harvesting and micro-dams to ensure sustainable water resources.
2. **Public-Private Partnerships for Renewable Energy**: Encourage investments in solar power plants and wind farms, leveraging government grants and subsidies.
3. **Early Warning Systems**: Invest in infrastructure like weather stations and communication networks to improve climate alert systems.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Estimated at $50 million for water management practices [4] and $200 million for renewable energy projects [5]. The cost of early warning system upgrades is unclear and should be verified.
* Potential Barriers: Resistance from local communities due to upfront costs, technical challenges in implementing new technologies, and political instability affecting policy implementation.

## Conclusion

Addressing the gaps in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Immediate action through targeted policies can significantly improve living standards while laying a foundation for future growth [6].
