# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Horn of Africa: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Revised Policy Brief**

## Executive Summary
This policy brief emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen environmental resilience in lower-income countries by prioritizing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. The current state of affairs is alarming, with Sub-Saharan Africa having only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank Open Data, 2024). To address this gap, we recommend investing in water infrastructure and sanitation projects, promoting renewable energy access through solar-powered mini-grids, and enhancing climate resilience measures such as early warning systems for extreme weather events.

## Context & Challenge
Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, electricity, and renewable energy sources due to limited resources and infrastructure. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing the frequency of extreme weather events like floods and droughts, further straining already scarce freshwater supplies (World Bank Open Data, 2021). The global population lacking safe water stands at [VERIFY] people (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), with Sub-Saharan Africa bearing a disproportionate burden.

## Analysis
The data is clear: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in terms of access to safe drinking water, with only 32.4% population having access compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Electricity coverage stands at [VERIFY]% (World Bank Open Data, 2023), far below the global average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data, 2023). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6) report indicates an 74% global coverage for safely managed drinking water access (UN SDG Report, 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Invest in Water Infrastructure and Sanitation
- Increase funding for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure projects.
- Implement community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs to promote safe disposal of human waste.

### Recommendation 2: Promote Renewable Energy Access
- Encourage the use of solar-powered mini-grids for off-grid communities in rural areas.
- Support government initiatives to install solar panels and battery storage systems in remote regions.

### Recommendation 3: Enhance Climate Resilience Measures
- Implement early warning systems for extreme weather events like floods and droughts.
- Promote climate-resilient agricultural practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties and improved irrigation techniques.

## Implementation Considerations
Establishing dedicated funding mechanisms for water and energy projects is crucial. Collaboration with local communities to ensure sustainability and ownership of projects is also essential.

## Conclusion
Decision-makers must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation initiatives for lower-income countries. Encouraging public-private partnerships can mobilize additional resources for these critical areas. Continuous monitoring of project outcomes is necessary to ensure sustainability and impact.
