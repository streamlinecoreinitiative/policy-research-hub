**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Indus Watershed: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

Immediate action is required to enhance resilience through improved water security and clean energy solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa. This policy brief outlines specific, actionable steps for decision-makers that address both the immediate and long-term needs of Sub-Saharan African communities. We recommend investing [VERIFY] per capita in large-scale water infrastructure projects, such as rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants (World Bank, 2024). Additionally, we suggest developing decentralized renewable energy solutions like solar microgrids, especially in remote areas, to increase access to electricity from the current 53.3% (World Bank, 2023).

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe disparities in access to safe drinking water and electricity, highlighting a critical gap in essential services. The region's reliance on fossil fuels contributes to just [VERIFY]% renewable energy consumption globally (World Bank, 2020), exacerbating climate vulnerability. Addressing these issues is not only crucial for improving public health but also for fostering sustainable economic growth and regional stability.

### Analysis

The data reveals a dire situation in Sub-Saharan Africa:

- **Water Security**: Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This disparity is exacerbated by climate variability, leading to frequent droughts and floods.
- **Electricity Access**: Just 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), with rural areas facing the highest barriers. Energy poverty compounds existing vulnerabilities, such as limited access to healthcare services during emergencies.
- **Renewable Energy Consumption**: The region lags behind globally in renewable energy consumption at just 19.7% (World Bank, 2020). This underutilization of clean energy sources not only contributes to climate change but also hinders economic development and environmental sustainability.

### Policy Recommendations

To enhance resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa:

1. **Expand Water Security**: Implement large-scale water infrastructure projects, such as rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants. Provide subsidies for private sector investments in water treatment facilities.
2. **Increase Access to Electricity**: Develop decentralized renewable energy solutions like solar microgrids, especially in remote areas. Establish partnerships with international organizations to finance these initiatives.
3. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the adoption of renewables through policy incentives and public-private partnerships. Invest in research and development to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning:

- **Costs**: Estimated costs for water security projects range from $500-$1,000 per capita (World Bank, 2024). Initiatives for renewable energy adoption can be funded through grants and public-private partnerships.
- **Barriers**: Potential challenges include limited funding, political resistance, and lack of technical expertise. Address these by establishing dedicated government agencies, training local communities, and engaging with stakeholders.

### Conclusion

By focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation, Sub-Saharan Africa can build a more resilient future for its citizens. This involves bold policy interventions backed by robust implementation strategies to ensure sustainable development in the region.
