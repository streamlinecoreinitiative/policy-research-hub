Here's the revised brief:

# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Andean highlands face severe water scarcity due to climate change, affecting agriculture and food security. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation as a solution to address this challenge.

## Current Water Scarcity Challenges in the Andean Highlands

Climate change has significantly impacted the Andean highlands, leading to erratic rainfall patterns and increased water scarcity [verify]. This has severe consequences for agriculture, which is the backbone of local economies. Irrigation systems are often inefficient, resulting in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage.

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration [1]. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion and increase water retention. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry systems in improving water availability and reducing the need for external inputs.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a viable solution for efficient irrigation. Small-scale hydroelectric systems can provide reliable energy, reducing reliance on diesel generators [2]. This approach also supports the transition towards clean cooking by providing access to renewable energy sources.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. Economic analysis shows that this approach is cost-effective [3], but further research is needed to assess long-term sustainability.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we recommend:

* Subsidies and low-interest loans to encourage community-led projects
* Infrastructure development for micro-hydro systems
* Capacity building for farmers and local communities on agroforestry practices and micro-hydro system maintenance
* Research on long-term sustainability assessments and community engagement strategies

## Actions/Recommendations List

1. **Support policy reforms** to prioritize climate-resilient irrigation methods in agricultural policies.
2. **Invest in infrastructure development**, including micro-hydro systems, to support the transition towards clean cooking.
3. **Provide capacity building and training** for farmers and local communities on agroforestry practices and micro-hydro system maintenance.
4. **Conduct further research** on long-term sustainability assessments and community engagement strategies.

## Closing Outlook

The Andean highlands face significant challenges due to climate change, but integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for climate-resilient irrigation. By supporting the transition towards clean cooking, we can contribute to sustainable development and achieve adaptation targets in NDCs.
