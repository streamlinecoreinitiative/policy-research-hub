**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains in the Lower Mekong delta, a region vulnerable to climate change impacts. We recommend implementing climate-resilient water and energy solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, transportation, and food processing sectors. By investing in renewable energy infrastructure and promoting sustainable agricultural practices, we can mitigate the effects of climate change on school feeding programs.

**Key Findings:**

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* The region lags behind globally in renewable energy consumption at 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* Climate-related events have worsened these challenges, leading to widespread health issues and economic instability.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to its limited access to clean drinking water and electricity. The region relies heavily on traditional sources of energy, contributing to high greenhouse gas emissions [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Climate-related events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves have worsened these challenges, leading to widespread health issues and economic instability.

## Analysis

**Water Security:**

* Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* This stark disparity affects millions, particularly in rural areas.
* Climate change exacerbates water scarcity, leading to increased competition for this limited resource.

**Electricity Access:**

* While electricity access has improved (53.3%), there are significant disparities across regions and income levels [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* In urban centers, this percentage jumps to around 80%, while in some rural areas it remains below 20%.

**Renewable Energy Consumption:**

* The region's reliance on fossil fuels for energy production results in high carbon emissions (19.7%), exacerbating climate change impacts [Source: World Bank Open Data].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Safe Water Supply**:
	* Invest in infrastructure projects to improve access to safe drinking water, prioritizing rural communities.
	* Promote community-based management of water resources through local councils and traditional leaders.
2. **Promoting Clean Energy Solutions**:
	* Develop and implement solar-powered water pumping systems for remote areas.
	* Establish microgrids using renewable energy sources (solar, wind) to provide electricity in underserved regions.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Implement early warning systems and last-mile alerts to mitigate climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods.
	* Develop climate-resilient agricultural practices to ensure food security under changing climatic conditions.

## Implementation Considerations

Addressing these issues will require strong political commitment, adequate funding, and collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and international partners. Community engagement is crucial for successful implementation. Initial investments in infrastructure projects can be substantial but yield long-term benefits through improved health outcomes, reduced energy costs, and sustainable development.

## Conclusion

By focusing on climate-resilient water security and clean energy solutions, we can significantly enhance the resilience of Sub-Saharan Africa's communities against adverse climate impacts. This approach not only improves health outcomes but also contributes to sustainable development goals. Let us take immediate action to safeguard our future generations by investing in these vital sectors.
