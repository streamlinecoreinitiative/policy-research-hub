**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Indus Watershed: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issue of landslide risk in the Indus watershed, we recommend implementing nature-based solutions that prioritize water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. Specifically, we propose investing in solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds to improve access to clean water sources, increasing investments in renewable energy projects, focusing on solar photovoltaic systems for electricity generation, and enhancing climate resilience programs through early-warning systems and last-mile alerts. By taking these evidence-based interventions, we can significantly reduce landslide risk and support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

## Context & Challenge

The Indus watershed is highly vulnerable to landslides due to its unique geography and climate conditions. Recent data shows that the region has experienced a significant increase in landslide events, resulting in loss of life and property damage [Source: [1]]. The lack of access to clean water sources and electricity further exacerbates this issue, making it even more challenging for communities to respond to and recover from these disasters.

According to World Bank data, only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: [2]], while just 53.3% have access to electricity [Source: [3]]. Climate change further compounds these challenges, intensifying droughts, floods, and extreme weather events.

## Analysis

### Water Security

* Only 40% of the region's population relies on groundwater sources for drinking water [Source: [4]].
* The lack of access to clean water sources poses significant risks from contamination and over-extraction.

### Clean Energy

* Despite a global renewable energy consumption rate of 19.7%, Sub-Saharan Africa lags with only 8.2% of total final energy consumption coming from renewables [Source: [5]]. [VERIFY]

### Climate Adaptation

* The region is particularly vulnerable to climate-related impacts such as desertification, sea-level rise, and increased frequency of droughts and floods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**: Prioritize the construction of solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds to improve access to clean water sources [Source: [6]].
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration**: Increase investments in renewable energy projects, focusing on solar photovoltaic systems for electricity generation [Source: [7]].
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Programs**: Implement early-warning systems and last-mile alerts to mitigate climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods [Source: [8]].

## Implementation Considerations

* Initial investments in water infrastructure and renewable energy projects can be funded through grants, loans, and public-private partnerships.
* Potential challenges include limited funding, technical expertise, and regulatory hurdles. Address these by establishing dedicated task forces, training local communities, and engaging with international partners.

## Conclusion

The Indus watershed is facing a pressing issue of landslide risk due to its unique geography and climate conditions. By implementing nature-based solutions that prioritize water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation, we can significantly reduce this risk and support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. We urge governments, development practitioners, and international partners to take immediate action to address these challenges.
