# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Pacific SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity and climate change impacts. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a critical strategy for lowering emissions from critical sectors such as agriculture and energy.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in Pacific SIDS

The Pacific SIDS are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including droughts, sea-level rise, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. The region's water scarcity is further exacerbated by population growth, unsustainable agricultural practices, and limited access to electricity for micro-hydro systems.

## Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry practices have been shown to enhance soil fertility, improve water retention, and promote biodiversity. By integrating agroforestry with traditional irrigation methods, communities can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Climate-Resilient Water Supply through Integrated Approaches

Climate-resilient irrigation systems can contribute significantly to reducing the region's vulnerability to climate change. By incorporating drought-resistant crops, improved water management practices, and efficient irrigation technologies, communities can ensure a stable food supply while minimizing their environmental footprint.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To scale up these solutions, governments, NGOs, and private sector stakeholders must collaborate to support policy reforms that promote watershed co-management and renewable energy development. Key areas for further research include:

*   System design and cost-effectiveness
*   Impact assessment of integrated agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems on water scarcity and climate change resilience
*   Development of climate-resilient irrigation technologies

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Establish a regional framework for watershed co-management**: Encourage governments to develop policies that support the participation of indigenous councils in watershed management decision-making processes.
2.  **Promote renewable energy development**: Support private sector investment in micro-hydro systems and other renewable energy technologies to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
3.  **Develop climate-resilient irrigation technologies**: Encourage research and development of efficient irrigation systems that incorporate drought-resistant crops and improved water management practices.

## Closing Outlook

The Pacific SIDS face significant environmental challenges, but by adopting integrated approaches to watershed co-management and renewable energy development, communities can enhance their resilience to climate change while promoting sustainable economic benefits.
