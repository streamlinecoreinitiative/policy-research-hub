**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Great Lakes Region: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant threats to agriculture, water security, and livelihoods in lower-income countries, particularly in regions vulnerable to climate stress. This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a potential solution for irrigation, enhancing both water security and renewable energy use among smallholder farmers.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Great Lakes Region**

The Great Lakes region is facing severe water scarcity due to climate change. Erratic rainfall patterns have significant impacts on agriculture, affecting food security and economic stability among smallholder farmers. Climate models predict continued changes in precipitation patterns, emphasizing the need for resilient irrigation methods.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Great Lakes region include boreholes and canals, which are often inefficient due to high water loss through evaporation ([verify] 30%) and seepage (5%). These traditional methods not only exacerbate poverty among smallholder farmers but also contribute to environmental degradation.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro technology, small-scale hydroelectric systems can provide a sustainable solution for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of these integrated systems at scale:

1.  **Develop policies that incentivize the use of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems**, such as subsidies or tax breaks.
2.  **Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data** to inform policy decisions and ensure effective implementation.

**Closing Outlook**

Early-warning systems and last-mile alerts are crucial for protecting livelihoods under climate stress in regions like the Great Lakes. The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for enhancing water security and renewable energy use among smallholder farmers. By addressing data gaps through further research, policymakers can make informed decisions to support the adoption of these systems at scale.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** that supports the integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro technology.
2.  **Establish partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector organizations** to facilitate the scaling up of these integrated solutions.
3.  **Invest in research and development** to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

This brief highlights the importance of addressing water scarcity and climate change impacts on agriculture through innovative, sustainable solutions like agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
