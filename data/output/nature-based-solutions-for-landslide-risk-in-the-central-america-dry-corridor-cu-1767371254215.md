**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Central America Dry Corridor: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by frequent droughts and landslides that disproportionately affect low-income communities. This brief proposes nature-based solutions to mitigate landslide risk through integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.

**I. Introduction to Water Scarcity and Landslide Risk**

Climate change has exacerbated droughts in the Central America dry corridor, leading to increased landslide risk. The region's average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify], with precipitation variability between 600-1400 mm [verify]. Existing irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly.

**II. Current Irrigation Practices and Their Limitations**

Traditional irrigation methods in the region consume significant amounts of energy (10-20 kWh/day) [verify] and water, exacerbating water scarcity. Canal systems lose a significant amount of water due to evaporation, while borehole pumps waste some water through seepage.

**III. Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it an essential component of climate-resilient agriculture. Benefits include:

* Soil organic matter increases by 2-8% [verify]
* Biodiversity increase is observed, but specific numbers are not provided
* Carbon sequestration benefits are noted, but exact amounts per hectare are not specified

**IV. Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, generating power ranging from 10-50 kW per system with an efficiency rate of 70-80% [verify]. Compared to traditional irrigation methods, micro-hydro systems offer significant cost savings.

**V. Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective solutions for climate-resilient water supply. Estimated costs per hectare range from $10,000-$25,000 [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Incentivize farmers**: Offer subsidies and low-interest loans to promote the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Grid integration**: Develop infrastructure for grid integration with micro-hydro systems to ensure a stable energy supply.
3. **Infrastructure development**: Invest in roads, storage facilities, and other essential infrastructure to support the implementation of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can reduce landslide risk, improve water security, and promote sustainable agriculture. It is essential that policymakers and stakeholders prioritize nature-based solutions to address these pressing issues and protect the livelihoods of vulnerable communities.
