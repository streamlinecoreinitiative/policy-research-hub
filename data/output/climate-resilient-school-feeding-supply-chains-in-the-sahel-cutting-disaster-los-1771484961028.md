# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sahel: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends investing in climate-resilient infrastructure and renewable energy to enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in school feeding supply chains in the Sahel region. The region faces severe water insecurity (32.4% access to safely managed drinking water) [1] and energy poverty (53.3% electricity access), exacerbating climate vulnerability [2]. By prioritizing investments in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation, implementing large-scale desalination projects for coastal regions, and promoting community-led initiatives like rainwater catchment systems, we can improve access to safe drinking water and electricity, thereby fostering resilience against future shocks.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately 850 million people [3], with only 32.4% having access to safely managed drinking water [4]. Electricity access lags far behind at 53.3%, particularly in rural areas where most of the population lives [5]. Climate change impacts are profound: extreme weather events have become more frequent and severe, threatening water security and increasing the vulnerability of populations reliant on traditional sources like rivers and lakes for drinking water [6].

## Analysis

Research indicates that Sub-Saharan Africa lacks adequate infrastructure to cope with these challenges effectively [7]. The region's reliance on fossil fuels poses significant environmental risks, contributing to air pollution and climate change. Renewable energy sources offer a cleaner alternative but require substantial investment in technology and policy frameworks [8]. The SDG 6 report shows that only 74% of the world has access to safely managed water [9], highlighting significant gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa where coverage is much lower at 32.4%.

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance environmental resilience and improve water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, we recommend:

1. **Investing in Renewable Energy**: Sub-Saharan Africa should prioritize investments in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
2. **Water Security Initiatives**: Implement large-scale desalination projects for coastal regions and small-scale water harvesting systems in arid areas. Promote community-led initiatives like rainwater catchment systems and micro-insurance schemes to mitigate drought risks.
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early-warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant roads and bridges, to protect critical sectors like agriculture and healthcare.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require substantial financial resources (likely in the billions of dollars) [10] and political commitment from governments, international organizations, and private sector partners. Collaboration with local communities is essential for successful implementation. Potential barriers include resistance to change, lack of skilled labor, and funding constraints.

## Conclusion

Enhancing environmental resilience requires immediate action by policymakers, investors, and community leaders in Sub-Saharan Africa. By investing in renewable energy, water security initiatives, and climate adaptation strategies, we can improve the region's ability to withstand future shocks and support sustainable development goals.
