# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Mekong basin: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries. This initiative will improve health outcomes during heatwaves and serve as a model for sustainable development pathways.

* Invest $[VERIFY] billion to establish 1,000 solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries by 2025.
* Collaborate with local communities and governments to develop climate-resilient infrastructure and promote renewable energy sources.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With only [32.4%] of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and over a quarter relying on traditional biomass for cooking (UN-Water/WHO), these issues jeopardize public health and economic stability.

## Analysis

The context of water scarcity is exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure, particularly in rural areas where access to safe drinking water remains limited. According to the World Bank (2024), only [32.4%] of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of [73.7%]. This disparity is further compounded by traditional biomass use for cooking, which contributes significantly to indoor air pollution and exacerbates respiratory diseases (UN-Water/WHO).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security**: Invest in water infrastructure projects such as wells, boreholes, and rainwater harvesting systems to improve access to safe drinking water (World Bank Open Data).
2. **Clean Energy**: Promote the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar power, wind turbines, and biogas systems for cooking and electricity generation (World Bank Open Data).
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Develop early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, and climate-resilient agricultural practices to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events (NOAA climate dataset).

## Implementation Considerations

The implementation of these recommendations will require significant investment, coordination between various stakeholders, and innovative financing mechanisms. Costs associated with infrastructure development are estimated at $[VERIFY] billion.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, promoting clean energy access, and bolstering climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa is essential for ensuring sustainable development. By taking immediate steps to improve infrastructure, diversify energy sources, and build resilience against climate impacts, we can create a more secure and prosperous future for the region's population.
