# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Great Lakes Region: Stabilizing Food Security During Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Central African Republic (CAR) is vulnerable to climate change impacts, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from its wetlands. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating poverty among smallholder farmers. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation in CAR.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Central African Region**

The region is affected by climate change (UN Environment Programme, 2020). Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have led to increased evaporation from wetlands, affecting agriculture and food security. Smallholder farmers rely heavily on irrigation systems, but these are often energy-intensive and costly.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in CAR include boreholes and canals, which suffer from high water loss through evaporation and seepage (World Bank, 2019). Traditional methods also require significant amounts of diesel fuel for pumping, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. The lack of efficient irrigation systems has severe consequences for food security.

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health and biodiversity (FAO, 2018). By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion and increase water retention. Case studies from the region demonstrate that agroforestry systems can improve crop yields.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for efficient irrigation in CAR (World Bank, [verify] 2020). These small-scale hydroelectric systems reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency. By harnessing the power of local water sources, farmers can save money on fuel costs.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation (CAR Ministry of Agriculture, 2019). Economic analyses show that these integrated solutions can be cost-effective. However, further research is needed to fully understand the economic impact and community engagement aspects.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale:

1. Develop policies and regulations to encourage investment in renewable energy and climate-resilient irrigation.
2. Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers, extension agents, and policymakers on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. Conduct further research on the economic impact, community acceptance, and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for climate-resilient irrigation in CAR. By combining these approaches, communities can enhance water security while promoting renewable energy use. Further research is needed to fully understand the economic impact and community engagement aspects.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Develop a national policy framework for climate-resilient irrigation.
2. Establish a training program for farmers and extension agents on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. Conduct further research on the economic impact and community acceptance of these integrated solutions.
