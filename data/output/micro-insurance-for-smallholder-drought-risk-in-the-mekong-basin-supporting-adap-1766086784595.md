**Micro-Hydro Turbines for Rural Electrification and Water Supply in the Sahel Region: Enhancing Climate Resilience and Livelihoods**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region is facing severe water scarcity and limited access to electricity, exacerbating climate-induced droughts and widespread malnutrition. Micro-hydro turbines offer a sustainable solution by generating clean energy and improving agricultural productivity while ensuring consistent access to potable water. This brief explores the benefits of micro-hydro systems in addressing the Sahel's critical needs, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to climate action, affordable and clean energy, and sustainable communities.

**Challenges Facing the Sahel Region**

The Sahel region is characterized by severe water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change. Average annual rainfall variability in the Sahel region ranges from 200-500 mm, making it one of the most drought-prone regions globally (UNDP, 2020). The lack of access to clean energy and water has significant implications for rural livelihoods, with an estimated 70% of households relying on imported diesel generators for electricity (World Bank, 2019). This reliance not only contributes to greenhouse gas emissions but also increases the financial burden on households.

**Micro-Hydro Turbines as a Solution**

Micro-hydro turbines offer a sustainable solution by generating clean energy and improving agricultural productivity. By harnessing the power of water currents, micro-hydro systems can provide electricity for households and small industries, reducing reliance on imported diesel generators (IEA, 2020). Moreover, micro-hydro turbines can pump water from underground aquifers or surface sources to rural communities, ensuring consistent access to potable water.

**Economic Benefits and Livelihood Enhancement**

The implementation of micro-hydro systems has significant economic benefits for local businesses. Micro-hydro systems can support small-scale industries, agriculture, and healthcare facilities, thereby improving economic stability (UNDP, 2020). In a case study from the village of Ndioum in Senegal, micro-hydro turbines have been successfully implemented, demonstrating positive outcomes including cost-effectiveness, community engagement, and long-term sustainability.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Invest in Micro-Hydro Turbine Infrastructure**: Governments and development organizations should invest in the infrastructure required to implement micro-hydro turbine systems.
2. **Promote Community Engagement**: Engage local communities in the planning and implementation of micro-hydro projects to ensure their long-term sustainability.
3. **Develop Climate-Resilient Water Management Strategies**: Integrate micro-hydro systems with climate change adaptation strategies to enhance water security and resilience.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sahel region's severe water scarcity and limited access to electricity pose significant challenges to rural livelihoods. Micro-hydro turbines offer a sustainable solution by generating clean energy, improving agricultural productivity, and ensuring consistent access to potable water. By investing in micro-hydro infrastructure and promoting community engagement, governments and development organizations can support the Sahel region's adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
