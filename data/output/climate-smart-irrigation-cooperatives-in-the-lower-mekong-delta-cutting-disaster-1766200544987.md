# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Lower Mekong delta: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Lower Mekong Delta: Enhancing Water Security and Renewable Energy Use**

**Executive Summary**

The Lower Mekong delta is a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change. Smallholder farmers are vulnerable to droughts and erratic rainfall patterns, exacerbating economic challenges. This brief explores an innovative solution: integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture**

The Lower Mekong delta is expected to experience more frequent and intense droughts (IPCC, 2019). Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from its vast wetlands further exacerbate water scarcity challenges. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, placing a significant burden on smallholder farmers.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the region include boreholes and canals. However, these systems suffer from high water loss through evaporation (estimated at [verify]%) and seepage (estimated at [verify]%). The reliance on diesel generators for pumping water contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and increased energy costs.

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration (IPCC, 2019). By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, agroforestry can enhance water retention and reduce erosion. Case studies demonstrate that well-designed agroforestry systems can increase crop yields.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology involves small-scale hydroelectric systems that harness the energy of rivers and streams. These systems have been shown to reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency (UN Environment Programme, 2018). By integrating micro-hydro with agroforestry, farmers can enjoy a reliable water supply while reducing their carbon footprint.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems. These integrated solutions have improved water security and reduced energy costs for smallholder farmers (Central African Republic Ministry of Agriculture, 2020). Economic analysis shows that these systems are cost-effective.

**Actions/Recommendations**

- Governments and development agencies should support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems through policy incentives and funding.
- Research institutions should conduct detailed socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
- International organizations should provide technical assistance to help scale up these climate-resilient irrigation systems.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Lower Mekong delta offer a promising solution for vulnerable groups facing water scarcity challenges. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, farmers can enhance both water security and renewable energy use. Further research is needed to ensure widespread adoption of these climate-resilient irrigation solutions.
