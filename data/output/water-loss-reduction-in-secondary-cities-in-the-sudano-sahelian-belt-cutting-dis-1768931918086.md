# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, limited access to electricity, and increasing climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), we recommend investing $1 billion annually for 5 years to improve access to safe drinking water. This investment would result in an additional [VERIFY] people gaining access to safely managed drinking water, bridging the significant gap between SSA's 32.4% coverage rate and the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Furthermore, we suggest promoting renewable energy adoption through subsidies, tax incentives, and regulatory frameworks, aiming for a [VERIFY]% increase in renewable energy consumption by investing $2 billion annually (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces critical challenges in ensuring access to safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and sustainable climate adaptation measures. Despite having the world's largest freshwater reserves (9.2% of resources withdrawn, World Bank Open Data, 2021), SSA struggles with inefficient use and inadequate access to safe drinking water. For example, only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This disparity highlights significant challenges in meeting basic human needs.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: SSA's water security challenge is exacerbated by inefficient use and inadequate access to safe drinking water. The region's population lacking safe water stands at approximately [NEEDS SOURCE] people, with a significant portion residing in Sub-Saharan Africa (UN-Water/WHO).
- **Clean Energy**: SSA’s reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. The region's renewable energy consumption remains low at only 19.7% of total final energy consumption (World Bank Open Data, 2020), underscoring the need for increased investment in clean energy technologies.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities such as droughts and floods. SSA experiences an average annual temperature rise of about [NEEDS SOURCE] per decade, leading to more frequent extreme weather events (NOAA climate data).

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, governments in SSA should prioritize the following actionable steps:

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest $1 billion annually for 5 years to improve water supply systems, sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotion programs.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**: Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources through subsidies, tax incentives, and regulatory frameworks, aiming for a [VERIFY]% increase in renewable energy consumption by investing $2 billion annually.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters and invest in infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Implementing these recommendations will require substantial financial resources. SSA governments should seek international aid and leverage private sector investments to finance clean energy projects and climate adaptation measures.
- **Capacity Building**: Strengthen institutional capacities in areas such as water resource management, renewable energy deployment, and climate modeling.

## Conclusion

Addressing the water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted efforts from governments, development partners, and communities alike. By prioritizing evidence-based interventions and fostering collaboration across sectors, SSA can build a more resilient future for its people.
