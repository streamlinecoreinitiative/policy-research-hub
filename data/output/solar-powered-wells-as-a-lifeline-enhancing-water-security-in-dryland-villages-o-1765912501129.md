**Solar-Powered Wells as a Lifeline: Enhancing Water Security in Dryland Villages of West Africa**

**Executive Summary**

Dryland villages in West Africa face severe water scarcity due to climate change, affecting millions of people's access to clean drinking water and irrigation for agriculture. Solar-powered wells offer a sustainable solution to this crisis, providing reliable access to clean water while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This brief highlights the benefits of solar-powered wells in enhancing water security, economic growth, and health outcomes in dryland villages.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in Dryland Villages of West Africa**

Dryland regions in West Africa are experiencing unprecedented water scarcity due to climate change. Rising temperatures have altered rainfall patterns, leading to droughts and decreased water availability (World Bank). According to UNICEF, child mortality rates related to lack of clean drinking water remain high in these regions (UNICEF).
