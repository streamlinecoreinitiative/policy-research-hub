# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Caribbean SIDS: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in Caribbean Small Island Developing States: Enhancing Resilience to Climate-Related Disasters**

**Executive Summary**

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, including landslides and heatwaves. These events have severe consequences on human health, infrastructure, and economic stability. This brief explores nature-based solutions for landslide risk reduction and heatwave mitigation in the Caribbean SIDS.

**Section 1: Introduction to Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries**

The Caribbean SIDS face unique environmental challenges due to their geographical location and economic constraints. Climate change exacerbates these issues, leading to more frequent and intense natural disasters. Landslides and heatwaves are among the most pressing concerns, affecting human health, infrastructure, and livelihoods.

* **Landslide risk:** The Caribbean SIDS experience high landslide frequencies due to deforestation, soil erosion, and heavy rainfall events.
* **Heatwave impact:** Heatwaves have severe consequences on human health, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. [verify]

**Section 2: Water Security and Clean Energy in the Caribbean SIDS**

Water scarcity is a significant challenge in the Caribbean SIDS, affecting agriculture, industry, and domestic use. Climate change further exacerbates this issue through erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation rates.

* **Current irrigation practices:** Boreholes, canals, and other traditional irrigation systems are often inefficient and prone to water loss.
* **Micro-hydro systems:** Small-scale hydroelectric systems offer a clean energy alternative for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency. [verify]

**Section 3: Agroforestry-Based Solutions for Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, the Caribbean SIDS can create climate-resilient water supply chains.

* **Benefits of agroforestry:** Improved soil fertility, increased crop yields, and enhanced ecosystem services.
* **Case studies:** Successful pilot projects demonstrating the effectiveness of agroforestry-micro-hydro integration in reducing landslide risk and improving heatwave resilience. [verify]

**Section 4: Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of nature-based solutions for landslide risk reduction and heatwave mitigation, we recommend:

1. **Policy frameworks:** Establishing national policies and regulations to promote agroforestry-micro-hydro integration.
2. **Capacity building:** Providing training and technical assistance to farmers, communities, and government agencies.
3. **Research and development:** Conducting further studies on the economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Develop national policies and regulations supporting agroforestry-micro-hydro integration.
2. Establish training programs for farmers, communities, and government agencies.
3. Conduct further research on the economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Caribbean SIDS face significant environmental challenges due to climate change. By integrating nature-based solutions such as agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can improve water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in these vulnerable regions.

**Key Data Points Needed:**

1. Average annual rainfall in selected regions within the Caribbean SIDS (e.g., Jamaica, Barbados) [verify].
2. Specific water loss percentages from existing irrigation systems [verify].
3. Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects [verify].

**Needed Evidence Snippets:**

1. **World Bank Report:** "Renewable Energy Consumption in Small Island Developing States" (latest report), focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).
2. Local survey data or studies measuring community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems [verify].

Changes made:

* Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
* Removed speculative claims that are not evidence-backed.
* Preserved the title, which is specific to the topic.
* Tightened language throughout the brief.
