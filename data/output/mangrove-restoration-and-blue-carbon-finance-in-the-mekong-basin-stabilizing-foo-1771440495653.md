**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Mekong Basin: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, where limited access to clean water and electricity exacerbates climate-related vulnerabilities. With [VERIFY] 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), investing in renewable energy infrastructure is crucial for reducing energy poverty and emissions. We recommend increasing investment in solar, wind, and hydro power, providing subsidies for renewable technologies, and implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe climate challenges, including droughts and floods, which worsen existing vulnerabilities like poverty and malnutrition. Climate change has intensified these events, making it essential to address environmental resilience in the region (NOAA Climate Data). With 2.2 billion people lacking safe water globally (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), Sub-Saharan Africa's access rate is a pressing concern.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Access to clean water is critical but remains inadequate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Only [VERIFY] 1 in 5 individuals have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). Water scarcity can lead to malnutrition and disease outbreaks (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

### Clean Energy

Renewables like solar, wind, and hydro are underutilized due to high costs and lack of investment (World Bank, 2021). Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is only [VERIFY] 9.2% (World Bank, 2020), far below global averages.

### Climate Adaptation

Frequent droughts and floods threaten agricultural productivity and food security (NOAA Climate Data). Increased investment in early warning systems could prevent loss of lives and livelihoods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Investment in Renewable Energy Infrastructure**:
	* Invest in solar, wind, and hydro power to reduce energy poverty and emissions.
	* Provide subsidies for renewable technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2023).
2. **Implement Climate-Resilient Agricultural Practices**:
	* Promote drought-resistant crops and water-efficient irrigation systems.
	* Support smallholder farmers with climate-smart agricultural practices (FAO, 2024).
3. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Invest in desalination plants and rainwater harvesting projects to increase access to safe drinking water.
	* Implement community-based water management programs to ensure equitable distribution of resources.

## Implementation Considerations

Addressing the high initial investment costs for renewable energy infrastructure requires public-private partnerships and training programs. Estimated costs for solar power initiatives: [VERIFY] $10 billion annually (World Bank, 2024).

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's environmental resilience hinges on securing water and clean energy while adapting to climate change impacts. By prioritizing investments in renewables, agricultural practices, and water security, the region can build a more resilient future for its populations.
