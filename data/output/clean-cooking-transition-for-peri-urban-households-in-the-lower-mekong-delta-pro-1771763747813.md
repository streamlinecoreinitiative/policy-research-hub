# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Lower Mekong delta: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Revised Document**

**Building Resilient Societies through Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the pressing need to address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) [1] and 53.3% with access to electricity (World Bank Open Data) [2], there is a critical gap in infrastructure development. To enhance resilience and improve quality of life for millions, we recommend prioritizing renewable energy integration into national grids and investing in community-led water resource management projects.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water, reliable electricity, and adapting to climate change impacts. The region's limited infrastructure development, particularly in terms of reliable electricity supply and adequate access to safe drinking water, exacerbates existing vulnerabilities due to climate change (World Bank Open Data) [3]. Climate-induced changes further complicate efforts to meet sustainable development goals, including those related to clean energy and water security.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with ensuring access to safe drinking water. Only 32.4% of the population benefits from such facilities, a disparity more pronounced in rural areas where infrastructure development lags behind urban centers (World Bank Open Data) [1]. In contrast, the global average for safely managed drinking water is 73.7% (World Bank Open Data) [4].

### Clean Energy

The renewable energy consumption rate stands at 19.7%, far below global targets and necessary for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change impacts (World Bank Open Data) [5]. Sub-Saharan Africa's reliance on fossil fuels, especially coal, exacerbates air pollution and health issues while limiting diversification of the energy sector.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate-related events like droughts and floods are becoming more frequent, impacting agricultural productivity and food security. Early warning systems for these hazards are insufficiently developed, leading to higher losses and vulnerabilities among communities (World Bank Open Data) [3].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Integrate Renewable Energy into National Grids**: Governments should prioritize integrating renewable energy sources (wind, solar) into national grids to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enhance climate resilience.
2. **Promote Community-Led Water Resource Management**: Support projects that empower local communities with the knowledge and resources to manage water resources sustainably, including rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and wastewater recycling.
3. **Develop Early Warning Systems for Climate Hazards**: Invest in early warning systems tailored to address specific climate risks such as droughts and floods, ensuring timely alerts reach vulnerable populations.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Conduct cost-benefit analyses to demonstrate the economic viability of proposed interventions, including financial models that show return on investment.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local authorities and community leaders in renewable energy technologies, water resource management, and climate adaptation strategies to ensure effective implementation.
- **Community Engagement**: Engage communities in planning and decision-making processes related to water security, clean energy, and climate resilience initiatives to enhance ownership and sustainability.

## Conclusion

Addressing the challenges of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation requires a concerted effort from governments, NGOs, and development practitioners. By implementing evidence-based policies and integrating renewable energy solutions into national infrastructures, Sub-Saharan Africa can build resilient societies capable of adapting to future environmental changes. We urge policymakers to prioritize these recommendations and work towards creating sustainable futures for millions in this region.
