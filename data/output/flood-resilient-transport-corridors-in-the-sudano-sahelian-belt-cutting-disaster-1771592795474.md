**Bridging Water Security Gaps with Climate Adaptation Strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the severe water security challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in rainwater harvesting systems and solar-powered desalination units to increase access to safely managed drinking water. This targeted approach will enhance resilience against future climate shocks while improving health outcomes and economic stability for vulnerable populations.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most water-stressed regions globally, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safe drinking water [1]. Climate change further compounds these challenges by altering rainfall patterns and increasing drought frequency, threatening existing water resources. The region's limited renewable energy consumption at 9.2% [2] exacerbates this issue by reducing the availability of power for water purification processes like desalination.

## Analysis

The primary challenge lies in the inadequate distribution of clean water. Current access rates are far below global averages and SDG 6 targets (74% coverage) [3].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges:

* **Invest in Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Implement rainwater harvesting ponds to capture and store rainfall in urban and peri-urban areas. These systems can significantly increase local water supplies, particularly during dry periods.
	+ Initial setup costs for rainwater harvesting systems range from $300-$1500 per household [4].
* **Solar-Powered Desalination Units**: Deploy solar-powered desalination units in coastal and arid regions where water scarcity is acute due to brackish groundwater or seawater.
	+ Solar-powered desalination units cost approximately $4000-$8000 each [5].

## Implementation Considerations

* **Costs**: Initial setup costs for rainwater harvesting systems range from $300-$1500 per household, while solar-powered desalination units cost approximately $4000-$8000 each.
* **Barriers**: Limited funding and technical expertise are key barriers to implementation. Government subsidies and partnerships with NGOs can mitigate these issues.

## Conclusion

Bridging water security gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa requires immediate action through targeted interventions such as rainwater harvesting systems and solar-powered desalination units. By doing so, we can enhance resilience against future climate shocks while improving health outcomes and economic stability for vulnerable populations. We urge governments to prioritize this agenda to achieve SDG 6 targets and build a more resilient Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Background Information

**Environment**

The natural environment refers to all living and non-living things occurring naturally, as well as the physical and biological factors along with their chemical interactions that impact on any organism or a group of organisms (Wikipedia) [6].

**Resilience**

Resilience refers to the ability of a system, community, or individual to withstand, recover from, or adapt to adversity, trauma, tragedy, or significant stress in a way that maintains its structure and function (Wikipedia) [7].
