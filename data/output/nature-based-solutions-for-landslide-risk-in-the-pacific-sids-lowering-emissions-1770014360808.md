**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Pacific SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing issue of landslide risk in the Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we recommend prioritizing nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and wetland restoration. This approach can lower emissions from critical sectors like agriculture and transportation while enhancing community resilience to natural disasters. Specifically, governments should invest in:

*   Replanting 10% of degraded forests within the next two years [VERIFY]
*   Restoring 5% of coastal wetlands by 2026
*   Integrating climate-resilient agriculture practices into national development plans

### Context & Challenge

The Pacific SIDS are highly vulnerable to landslide risk due to their unique geography and climate. Rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, and soil erosion exacerbate the issue, posing significant threats to human lives, infrastructure, and economic stability (World Bank Open Data, 2024). The region's reliance on fossil fuels further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, making it essential to adopt nature-based solutions that mitigate these impacts.

### Analysis

A recent study by the University of the South Pacific (USP) highlights the critical role of reforestation in reducing landslide risk. By replanting degraded forests, communities can enhance soil stability, prevent landslides, and promote biodiversity (USP, 2022). Similarly, restoring coastal wetlands can help absorb excess rainfall, reduce storm surges, and protect against erosion (NOAA Climate, 2023).

### Policy Recommendations

To address landslide risk in the Pacific SIDS, we recommend:

1.  **Reforestation**: Invest in replanting degraded forests to enhance soil stability and prevent landslides.
2.  **Wetland Restoration**: Restore coastal wetlands to absorb excess rainfall, reduce storm surges, and protect against erosion.
3.  **Climate-Resilient Agriculture**: Integrate climate-resilient agriculture practices into national development plans to promote sustainable land use.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require a coordinated effort involving governments, NGOs, private sector entities, and international partners. Funding mechanisms such as grants, concessional loans, and public-private partnerships can facilitate investment in reforestation and wetland restoration projects (World Bank Open Data, 2023). Community participation through participatory planning processes is crucial for ensuring that solutions are tailored to local needs and preferences.

### Conclusion

The Pacific SIDS face significant challenges related to landslide risk due to their unique geography and climate. By prioritizing nature-based solutions like reforestation and wetland restoration, governments can lower emissions from critical sectors while enhancing community resilience to natural disasters. We urge policymakers to take immediate action by investing in these initiatives and promoting sustainable land use practices.
