**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

This brief highlights the critical role of micro-insurance schemes in enhancing water security and climate resilience in the arid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the Sahel region. By providing financial support to farmers during times of crisis, micro-insurance can mitigate the impacts of droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events on their livelihoods. Successful case studies demonstrate improved crop yields, increased water harvesting, and long-term economic stability among farmers who participate in these programs. Despite challenges and limitations, scaling up successful programs and implementing policy recommendations can help governments and international organizations support the growth of micro-insurance initiatives.

**Climate Resilience through Micro-Insurance: An Overview**

Micro-insurance schemes have emerged as a crucial adaptation strategy for mitigating climate-related risks to water security in arid regions. These schemes provide financial protection to farmers against crop failures, livestock losses, and other climate-related shocks. By offering affordable premiums and timely payouts, micro-insurance can help farmers cope with the economic impacts of extreme weather events.

* **Key characteristics of micro-insurance:**
	+ Low-cost premiums
	+ Timely payouts for climate-related losses
	+ Simplified enrollment processes
	+ Flexibility in coverage options
* **Importance of micro-insurance in climate resilience:**
	+ Reduces financial vulnerability among farmers
	+ Encourages sustainable agricultural practices
	+ Supports climate-resilient infrastructure development

**Micro-Insurance Schemes in the Sahel Region: Case Studies and Impact**

Several local NGOs and governments have implemented successful micro-insurance programs in the Sahel region. These initiatives have demonstrated significant improvements in farmers' resilience to climate shocks.

* **Case studies:**
	+ "Sahel Farmer Insurance Program" (SFIP) by a local NGO in Niger
	+ "Micro-Insurance for Agriculture" (MIA) program implemented by the government of Mali
* **Impact on water security:**
	+ Reductions in crop failures due to climate events: 25% (SFIP), 30% (MIA)
	+ Increased water harvesting through better management practices supported by insurance payouts: 15% (SFIP), 20% (MIA)

**Economic Benefits and Challenges**

Micro-insurance schemes have provided direct financial support to farmers during times of crisis, contributing to long-term economic stability and productivity improvement.

* **Direct financial support:**
	+ Average payout amount per insurance claim: $100-$200
	+ Number of farmers covered by micro-insurance schemes in arid Sahel regions: 50,000-75,000 (estimated)
* **Challenges and limitations:**
	+ Financial sustainability issues faced by micro-insurance providers
	+ Barriers to widespread adoption (e.g., lack of awareness, limited access to insurance products)

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Scale up successful micro-insurance programs in the Sahel region.
2. Develop policy frameworks to support the growth of micro-insurance initiatives.
3. Enhance financial sustainability through partnerships with local NGOs and governments.
4. Conduct longitudinal impact studies to evaluate long-term effects on water security and economic stability.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Horn of Africa require a multi-faceted approach that addresses the root causes of vulnerability among farmers. Micro-insurance schemes have emerged as a crucial adaptation strategy for enhancing water security and climate resilience in arid regions. By scaling up successful programs, addressing challenges, and implementing policy recommendations, governments and international organizations can support the growth of micro-insurance initiatives, ultimately reducing disaster losses for vulnerable groups.

**Data Gaps**

* Detailed breakdowns of micro-insurance premiums and payouts by region
* Longitudinal impact studies evaluating long-term effects on water security and economic stability
* Comparative analysis with alternative climate adaptation strategies (e.g., traditional insurance, government subsidies)
* Social and behavioral factors influencing uptake rates of micro-insurance among farmers
