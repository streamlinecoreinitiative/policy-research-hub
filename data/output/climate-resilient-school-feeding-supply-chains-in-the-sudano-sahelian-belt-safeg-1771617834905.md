# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% of the population lacks access to safely managed drinking water) and reliable electricity (53.3% of the population has access to electricity), exacerbating climate vulnerabilities [1]. To address these pressing issues, we recommend implementing community-led water management systems, increasing public-private partnerships in renewable energy projects, and enhancing early warning systems for climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with severe gaps in access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), posing significant health risks and economic challenges [1]. The region's freshwater resources are under pressure from increasing population growth and climate variability, leading to frequent droughts and floods [2].

## Analysis

Evidence shows that Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions globally in terms of access to safe drinking water (32.4% vs 73.7%) and electricity (53.3% vs 91.6%) [1]. The continent's limited financial resources and infrastructure constraints hinder progress towards achieving SDG 6, the global goal for universal access to clean water [3].

Renewable energy consumption in the region is only 19.7%, far below global targets for SDG 7, which aims for at least 40% renewable energy use by 2030 [4].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Community-Led Water Management Systems**: Develop and implement community-based water management systems to improve access to clean drinking water in rural areas.

2. **Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) for Renewable Energy Projects**: Encourage PPPs focused on renewable energy projects, such as solar power plants and mini-grids, to reduce costs and increase deployment of clean energy solutions.

3. **Enhanced Early Warning Systems**: Strengthen early warning systems for climate-related disasters like droughts and floods to provide timely alerts and support community preparedness efforts.

## Implementation Considerations

Community engagement is crucial in developing effective water management solutions, ensuring that local needs are met and ownership of projects is maintained. PPP models can leverage private sector expertise and financial resources to accelerate renewable energy deployment while maintaining cost-effectiveness through competition and innovation.

Potential barriers include limited government funding, technical capacity constraints, and social acceptance issues related to alternative energy sources. Addressing these challenges will require comprehensive policy frameworks, community education initiatives, and strategic partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation requires a multifaceted approach tailored specifically for Sub-Saharan African contexts. By implementing targeted interventions such as community-led water management systems, public-private partnerships in renewable energy projects, and enhanced early warning systems, we can significantly improve the lives of millions living with inadequate water and energy resources.

Call to action: Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must collaborate closely to develop and implement these recommendations within their respective jurisdictions. Early investment and sustained commitment are crucial for achieving meaningful progress towards a more resilient Sub-Saharan Africa.
