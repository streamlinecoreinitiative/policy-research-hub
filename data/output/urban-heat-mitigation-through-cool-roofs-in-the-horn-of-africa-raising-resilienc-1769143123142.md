**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Horn of Africa: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity and energy deficits, exacerbating climate vulnerabilities. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in clean energy, water infrastructure, and climate adaptation measures to achieve SDG 6 goals by 2030. Specifically, governments should implement policies to increase renewable energy production, particularly solar and wind power, targeting Sub-Saharan Africa's most accessible regions first. This will require an initial investment of $[VERIFY] billion annually, primarily focused on renewable energy projects.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water (32.4%) [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023] and electricity (53.3%) [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2022]. These deficits hinder economic development and increase vulnerability to environmental stresses. Climate change intensifies droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, further straining already limited resources. For instance, the Horn of Africa has experienced severe droughts in recent years, affecting millions of people and livestock [Source: FAO, 2022].

## Analysis

Access to safely managed drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa is only a third of the global average (32.4% vs. 73.7% worldwide) [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. Electricity access remains low at 53.3%, with rural areas disproportionately affected [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2022]. Renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7%, far below international targets set for reducing carbon emissions [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Clean Energy**: Implement policies to increase renewable energy production, particularly solar and wind power, targeting Sub-Saharan Africa's most accessible regions first.
2. **Enhance Water Security**: Fund large-scale water infrastructure projects like desalination plants and improved irrigation systems. Prioritize rural areas where access is most lacking.
3. **Promote Climate Resilience**: Develop early warning systems for extreme weather events and invest in climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crop varieties.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments will range from $[VERIFY] billion to $5 billion annually, primarily focused on renewable energy projects. Water infrastructure improvements could cost between $20 million to $50 million per project [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020]. Potential barriers include political resistance and limited funding. Address these by securing international aid and collaborating with regional partners.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must accelerate efforts in clean energy, water security, and climate adaptation to meet SDG 6 goals within the next decade. By taking bold steps now, governments can significantly improve their regions' resilience against environmental challenges.
