**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with rising temperatures and heatwaves posing significant health risks to peri-urban households. This brief highlights the importance of transitioning to clean cooking methods as a critical component of environmental resilience in this region. By adopting cleaner cooking technologies, households can reduce their reliance on traditional biomass fuels, which exacerbate air pollution and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, clean cooking solutions can improve indoor air quality, reducing respiratory illnesses and other heat-related health issues.

**Introduction to Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries**

The Central America dry corridor is characterized by rapid urbanization, climate change impacts, and limited access to clean energy and water resources. Rising temperatures are projected to increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves, further straining local healthcare systems and economies. In this context, environmental resilience becomes a critical concern for policymakers, development practitioners, and local communities.

**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Peri-Urban Households**

Peri-urban households in the Central America dry corridor face unique challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Key issues include:

* **Water scarcity**: Limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities exacerbates health risks and economic burdens.
* **Energy poverty**: Reliance on traditional biomass fuels contributes to indoor air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and heat-related illnesses.
* **Climate vulnerability**: Peri-urban households are often more exposed to climate-related hazards, such as flooding and landslides.

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households**

The transition to clean cooking technologies is essential for improving health outcomes in peri-urban households. Key benefits include:

* **Improved indoor air quality**: Reduced exposure to particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from biomass fuels.
* **Enhanced energy efficiency**: Cleaner cooking methods reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
* **Increased access to clean water**: Reduced risk of water-borne diseases associated with traditional biomass fuel use.

**Case Studies and Policy Recommendations**

Several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of clean cooking transitions in peri-urban households:

* **Solar-powered cookstoves**: Successful implementation in rural Guatemala reduced PM2.5 emissions by 90% and improved indoor air quality.
* **Biogas systems**: Adoption in urban Nicaragua increased access to clean energy, reducing reliance on biomass fuels.

To support the transition to clean cooking technologies, policy recommendations include:

* **Incentives for clean cookstove adoption**: Governments can offer subsidies or tax credits for households installing cleaner cooking technologies.
* **Zoning regulations and building codes**: Urban planning policies can promote the use of clean energy sources in new construction projects.
* **Public education campaigns**: Awareness-raising initiatives can inform households about the benefits of clean cooking technologies.

**Data Points Needed**

To support policy recommendations, additional data points are required:

* Average annual temperature rise in Central America dry corridor cities over the past decade
* Cost savings per city due to reduced energy consumption for heating/cooling
* Number of jobs created by clean cookstove installation and maintenance

**Closing Outlook**

The transition to clean cooking technologies is a critical component of environmental resilience in lower-income countries. By adopting cleaner cooking methods, peri-urban households can reduce their reliance on traditional biomass fuels, improve indoor air quality, and enhance energy efficiency. Policymakers, development practitioners, and local communities must work together to support the widespread adoption of clean cooking technologies, ensuring improved health outcomes and environmental sustainability in the Central America dry corridor.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop and implement incentives for clean cookstove adoption**: Governments can offer subsidies or tax credits for households installing cleaner cooking technologies.
2. **Promote zoning regulations and building codes**: Urban planning policies can encourage the use of clean energy sources in new construction projects.
3. **Launch public education campaigns**: Awareness-raising initiatives can inform households about the benefits of clean cooking technologies.
4. **Support research and development**: Encourage innovation in cleaner cooking technologies, including biogas systems and solar-powered cookstoves.
