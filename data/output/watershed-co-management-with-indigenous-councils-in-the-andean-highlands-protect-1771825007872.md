# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Andean highlands: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Andean Highlands: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to strengthen environmental resilience in lower-income countries, focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. In Sub-Saharan Africa, millions of people lack safe drinking water, electricity remains scarce, and climate change impacts are severe. To address these challenges, we recommend:

* Implementing cost-effective interventions for clean cooking and electricity access
* Promoting climate-resilient infrastructure development
* Investing in water conservation technologies

These recommendations can be achieved through a combination of government policies, international cooperation, and community-led initiatives.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental challenges. According to the World Bank Open Data (2024), only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally [1]. Renewable energy consumption in the region is a mere [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption, far below global averages [2]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, with millions lacking access to safe water resources due to climate-induced droughts and floods.

### Analysis

The evidence is clear: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind globally on access to safe drinking water and electricity. Renewable energy consumption in the region is woefully inadequate. Climate change impacts are severe, with over 2 billion people worldwide lacking safe water resources [3]. To address these challenges, we must prioritize watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Andean highlands.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Clean Cooking Transition**: Implement solar-powered stoves for peri-urban households, focusing on low-income communities. Provide subsidies or vouchers to make these technologies accessible.
2. **Electricity Access**: Expand rural electrification programs using renewable energy sources like solar mini-grids. Offer incentives for private sector participation in grid extension projects.
3. **Water Security**: Invest in desalination plants and water storage facilities in coastal areas prone to climate-induced water scarcity. Promote rainwater harvesting and improve wastewater treatment infrastructure.

### Implementation Considerations

* Estimated costs for clean cooking transition range from [VERIFY] per household, with potential subsidies available [4].
* Limited funding, lack of technology adoption, regulatory hurdles, and resistance to change among communities are significant barriers.
* International cooperation and community-led initiatives can help overcome these challenges.

### Conclusion

Governments, NGOs, and development partners must prioritize watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Andean highlands to enhance water security, promote clean energy access, and build climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. We recommend initiating a pilot project for solar-powered stoves, discussing rural electrification plans with stakeholders, and allocating resources for desalination plant construction.

### Key Data Points

1. Access to safely managed drinking water: 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank Open Data) [1].
2. Renewable energy consumption: [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption in the region (World Bank Open Data) [2].
3. Population lacking safe water resources due to climate change: Over 2 billion people globally (UN-Water/WHO) [3].

### Additional Evidence Needed

* Climate Change Impact Studies: Detailed reports on climate-induced changes affecting water availability and access in Sub-Saharan Africa.
* Renewable Energy Deployment Reports: Specific data on renewable energy deployment in Sub-Saharan Africa, including costs and benefits of different technologies.
