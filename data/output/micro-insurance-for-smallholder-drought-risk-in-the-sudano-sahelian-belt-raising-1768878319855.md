**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the need to address drought risk and climate change impacts on smallholder communities in the Sudano-Sahelian belt through micro-insurance. The region is highly vulnerable to droughts, which can lead to crop failures, livestock deaths, and increased poverty levels. To raise resilience finance for these communities, we recommend:

1. **Establish a regional micro-insurance pool**: Develop a collaborative framework among countries in the Sudano-Sahelian belt to create a shared risk pool for smallholder farmers.
2. **Provide training and capacity-building programs**: Offer regular training sessions and workshops for insurance providers, agricultural extension agents, and smallholder farmers on drought risk management and micro-insurance products.
3. **Increase access to climate-resilient agriculture practices**: Promote the adoption of climate-resilient agricultural practices among smallholder farmers through targeted support services and incentives.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with 32.4% of its population lacking access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). The Sudano-Sahelian belt, which spans across several countries in West Africa, is particularly prone to droughts and water scarcity due to its semi-arid climate.

According to the World Bank Open Data, only [VERIFY] % of renewable energy is consumed globally, with Sub-Saharan Africa being one of the regions that lag behind (World Bank, 2020). Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns, making it difficult for smallholder farmers to adapt.

## Analysis

Smallholder farmers in the Sudano-Sahelian belt face significant drought risks, which can lead to crop failures and livestock deaths. According to a study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), [VERIFY] % of smallholder farmers in the region experience droughts at least once a year (ICRISAT, 2020).

To mitigate these risks, micro-insurance products can provide financial protection to smallholder farmers. However, there is limited access to such products due to lack of awareness and high costs associated with insurance premiums.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish a regional micro-insurance pool**: Develop a collaborative framework among countries in the Sudano-Sahelian belt to create a shared risk pool for smallholder farmers.
	* Actors: National governments, regional organizations (e.g., ECOWAS), and international development partners
	* Timeframe: 2-3 years
	* Funding: Initial investment of $1 million from national governments and regional organizations, with subsequent funding through premiums paid by insured farmers
2. **Provide training and capacity-building programs**: Offer regular training sessions and workshops for insurance providers, agricultural extension agents, and smallholder farmers on drought risk management and micro-insurance products.
	* Actors: National governments, regional organizations (e.g., ECOWAS), and international development partners
	* Timeframe: Ongoing, with regular assessments and evaluations
	* Funding: $500,000 per year from national governments and regional organizations
3. **Increase access to climate-resilient agriculture practices**: Promote the adoption of climate-resilient agricultural practices among smallholder farmers through targeted support services and incentives.
	* Actors: National governments, regional organizations (e.g., ECOWAS), and international development partners
	* Timeframe: 2-3 years
	* Funding: Initial investment of $500,000 from national governments and regional organizations, with subsequent funding through grants and subsidies for farmers

## Implementation Considerations

Establishing a regional micro-insurance pool requires collaboration among countries in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. Potential barriers include:

* Lack of funding: Initial investment required to establish the pool
* Limited capacity: Insufficient expertise and resources within national governments and regional organizations to develop and implement micro-insurance programs
* Regulatory frameworks: Inconsistent or inadequate regulatory frameworks for insurance products in some countries

## Conclusion

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to droughts, which can lead to crop failures, livestock deaths, and increased poverty levels among smallholder farmers. To raise resilience finance for these communities, we recommend establishing a regional micro-insurance pool, providing training and capacity-building programs, and increasing access to climate-resilient agriculture practices.

Urgent action is needed to address drought risk and climate change impacts on smallholder communities in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. We urge national governments, regional organizations, and international development partners to collaborate and invest in micro-insurance programs that can provide financial protection to these vulnerable farmers.
