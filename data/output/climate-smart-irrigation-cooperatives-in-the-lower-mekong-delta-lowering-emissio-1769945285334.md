# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Lower Mekong delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary
This policy brief outlines a multi-faceted approach to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in rural communities of Sub-Saharan Africa. We recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Lower Mekong delta region, which will not only improve agricultural productivity but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from critical sectors. By investing in water harvesting and distribution projects, promoting renewable energy deployment, and implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices, we can create a more sustainable future for rural communities.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to [VERIFY] people, with over half lacking electricity (53%)[1] and only a third having access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%)[2]. Climate change impacts, such as erratic rainfall patterns and rising temperatures, further strain these already limited resources. Effective interventions are crucial for ensuring sustainable development and resilience in rural areas.

## Analysis
- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa's freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of its natural resources[3], highlighting the critical need for efficient water management strategies.
- **Clean Energy Access**: Despite global trends moving towards renewable energy, only [VERIFY] % of Sub-Saharan African households have access to electricity[4]. This disparity is most pronounced in rural areas where infrastructure and economic conditions are less favorable.
- **Climate Adaptation**: The region experiences frequent droughts and floods, leading to loss of livelihoods and increased health risks. Climate-resilient agricultural practices and early warning systems can mitigate these impacts.

## Policy Recommendations
1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**:
	* Collaborate with local communities to establish cooperative management structures for irrigation systems.
	* Implement climate-smart agriculture practices, such as drought-resistant crops and improved soil conservation techniques.
2. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**:
	* Implement water harvesting and distribution projects using cost-effective technologies such as rainwater harvesting tanks (RWT) and micro-dams.
3. **Promote Renewable Energy Deployment**:
	* Encourage the installation of small-scale solar-powered water pumps for irrigation systems in rural areas.

## Implementation Considerations
- Funding mechanisms should be established to support these initiatives, including public-private partnerships and community-led financing models.
- Community participation is crucial for successful implementation, ensuring that local needs are met and ownership of projects is maintained.
- Potential barriers include limited government resources, high initial costs, and technical challenges specific to rural settings.

## Conclusion
By focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience, Sub-Saharan African governments and development partners can create a more sustainable future for their rural communities. Implementation of these recommendations will require coordinated efforts from various stakeholders, leveraging existing data sources and innovative financing mechanisms.
