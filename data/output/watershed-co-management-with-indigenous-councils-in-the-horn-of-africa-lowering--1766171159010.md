# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Horn of Africa: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Ethiopian Highlands face severe water scarcity due to climate change, affecting agricultural production and food security. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can enhance water security and reduce poverty among smallholder farmers. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in the Ethiopian Highlands.

## Water Scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands: A Growing Concern

Climate change is impacting agriculture in Ethiopia, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns threatening crop yields and food security. The Ethiopian Highlands are particularly vulnerable to water scarcity due to their high elevation and limited rainfall. According to NOAA climate data, the average annual rainfall in selected highland regions of Ethiopia is [verify]. This scarcity has significant implications for smallholder farmers who rely heavily on irrigation systems.

## Integrating Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems

Agroforestry offers benefits for soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By promoting water retention and reducing erosion, agroforestry can improve the resilience of irrigation systems to droughts and floods. Micro-hydro technology provides a reliable source of renewable energy for pumping water from wells or rivers. When combined, these approaches can enhance the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation systems.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale, we recommend:

*   **Invest in community-led watershed management initiatives**, which prioritize indigenous knowledge and co-management practices.
*   **Provide technical assistance and training** to smallholder farmers on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
*   **Develop economic incentives** for farmers to adopt these systems, such as subsidies or low-interest loans.
*   **Conduct further research** on the long-term climate impacts of these systems.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Support community-led watershed management initiatives that prioritize indigenous knowledge and co-management practices.
2.  Provide technical assistance and training to smallholder farmers on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  Develop economic incentives for farmers to adopt these systems, such as subsidies or low-interest loans.
4.  Conduct further research on the long-term climate impacts of these systems.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to water scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands. By prioritizing community-led watershed management initiatives, providing technical assistance and training, developing economic incentives, and conducting further research, we can support smallholder farmers in adopting climate-resilient irrigation systems.
