# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: raising resilience finance for communities

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water (32.4% of its population lacks safely managed drinking water) and reliable electricity (53.3% of the population has access). Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, leading to frequent droughts, floods, and erratic weather patterns. To address these issues, we recommend strengthening institutional frameworks, investing in infrastructure, and promoting sustainable practices to ensure water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is the least connected region for electricity, with only 53.3% of its population having access (World Bank Open Data). The region's reliance on fossil fuels contributes to environmental degradation and health risks. Climate change impacts are already being felt, with frequent droughts, floods, and erratic weather patterns threatening water security and agricultural productivity.

## Analysis

### Access to Safe Drinking Water

Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind other regions globally in terms of access to safe drinking water (32.4% vs 73.7%, World Bank Open Data). This disparity is partly due to inadequate funding for infrastructure projects. According to the UN-Water/WHO, 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe water, with the majority living in Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Renewable Energy Consumption

Despite global trends, renewable energy consumption remains low at [VERIFY]%. This is partly due to limited investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power plants.

### Climate Adaptation Efforts

Current climate adaptation strategies are insufficient, leading to recurrent crises such as droughts and floods. The region needs to develop early warning systems and last-mile alerts to mitigate disaster losses.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Implement water supply projects in underserved regions using existing funds (World Bank data). Allocate resources for pipeline infrastructure to connect remote areas.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Development**: Invest in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power plants to increase renewable energy consumption. Provide incentives for private sector investment through tax breaks and subsidies.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Develop early warning systems and last-mile alerts to mitigate disaster losses. Promote climate-smart agriculture practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimated investments range from $1 billion for water supply projects to [VERIFY] billion for renewable energy initiatives. Political will, insufficient funding, lack of skilled labor, and community resistance are potential obstacles to implementation.

## Conclusion

Urgent investment in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is crucial for Sub-Saharan Africa's sustainable development. We urge policymakers to prioritize these areas and collaborate with international partners to secure additional funds, engage local communities, and develop comprehensive policy frameworks.
