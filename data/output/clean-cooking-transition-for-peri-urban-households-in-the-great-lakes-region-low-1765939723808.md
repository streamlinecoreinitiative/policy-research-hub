**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Great Lakes Region: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

### Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to lower-income countries, particularly those in the Great Lakes region. In rural Rwanda, erratic rainfall and water scarcity affect agriculture and energy supply, exacerbating poverty and vulnerability. This brief explores biochar-based agroforestry systems as a dual solution for improving soil health, water retention, and generating clean energy for remote communities. Successful implementation of such projects can build long-term resilience against climate change impacts while addressing immediate needs.

### Introduction to Climate Change Impact in Rwanda

Rwanda is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its geography and socio-economic characteristics. The country faces significant challenges related to erratic rainfall patterns, water scarcity, and reduced crop yields. These issues have severe implications for agriculture, energy supply, and overall economic development.

*   **Description of Rwanda's vulnerability:**
    *   Rwanda's location in the African Great Lakes region makes it susceptible to climate change impacts.
    *   The country's small size and high population density exacerbate its vulnerability.
*   **Overview of existing challenges:**
    *   Erratic rainfall patterns have reduced crop yields, affecting food security and livelihoods.
    *   Water scarcity has increased competition for this resource, leading to conflicts over land use.

### Biochar-Based Agroforestry Systems: A Sustainable Solution

Biochar-based agroforestry systems offer a promising solution to address climate-related challenges in Rwanda. These systems enhance soil fertility and water retention through the use of biochar, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and irrigation systems.

*   **Benefits of biochar:**
    *   Improved soil health and increased crop yields.
    *   Enhanced water retention and reduced evaporation.
    *   Reduced greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.
*   **Potential applications:**
    *   Biochar can be used to produce clean energy through biogas production.
    *   Integrated agroforestry systems can provide additional income streams for farmers.

### Case Study: Successful Implementation in Rural Rwanda

Several projects have successfully implemented biochar-based agroforestry systems in rural Rwanda. These initiatives demonstrate the potential of this approach to improve environmental and economic outcomes.

*   **Examples of successful implementation:**
    *   A project in Kigali Province increased crop yields by 30% through improved soil health.
    *   Another project in Rulindo District reduced water usage for irrigation by 50%.
*   **Case study on specific project's impact:**
    *   A community-led initiative in Bugesera District implemented biochar-based agroforestry systems, resulting in increased income from agriculture and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

### Integration with Renewable Energy Solutions

Biochar can be used to produce clean energy through biogas production. This energy can power microgrids or off-grid solar systems, providing reliable electricity for remote communities.

*   **Potential applications:**
    *   Biogas production from biochar can reduce reliance on biomass and fossil fuels.
    *   Integrated renewable energy systems can provide additional income streams for farmers.

### Community Engagement and Local Governance

Community participation is essential for the successful implementation of biochar-based agroforestry systems. Local governance plays a crucial role in facilitating sustainable adoption of these technologies.

*   **Importance of community engagement:**
    *   Community-led initiatives are more likely to be sustainable and effective.
    *   Local knowledge and expertise can inform project design and implementation.
*   **Role of local governance:**
    *   Local governments can facilitate the adoption of biochar-based agroforestry systems through policy support and resource allocation.

### Challenges and Future Directions

Several challenges need to be addressed for the widespread adoption of biochar-based agroforestry systems in Rwanda. These include initial costs, technical expertise, and scaling up the approach with government support, private sector partnerships, and international funding.

*   **Challenges faced during implementation:**
    *   High upfront costs for biochar production and system installation.
    *   Limited technical expertise among farmers and local authorities.
*   **Recommendations for future directions:**
    *   Governments can provide policy support and resource allocation to facilitate adoption.
    *   Private sector partnerships can help reduce costs and improve access to technology.

### Key Data Points Needed

Several data points are needed to further understand the potential of biochar-based agroforestry systems in Rwanda. These include:

*   **Population affected by water scarcity:**
    *   Estimated number of people affected by water scarcity in rural Rwanda.
*   **Current energy consumption patterns:**
    *   Electricity vs. biomass consumption patterns in Rwandan rural areas.
*   **Average annual rainfall variability:**
    *   Rainfall data for key agricultural zones in Rwanda.

### Official Sources

Several official sources provide valuable information on climate change impacts and adaptation strategies in Rwanda. These include:

*   **United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Rwanda** - Reports on climate change impacts and adaptation strategies.
*   **World Bank Rwanda** - Water resource management reports and investment projects in rural areas.
*   **OECD Environment Directorate** - Publications on clean energy solutions for rural communities.

### Data Gaps

Several data gaps need to be addressed to further understand the potential of biochar-based agroforestry systems in Rwanda. These include:

*   **Detailed cost-benefit analysis:**
    *   Comparison of biochar-based agroforestry with conventional farming practices.
*   **Long-term economic and environmental sustainability metrics:**
    *   Post-project implementation data on economic and environmental outcomes.

### Actions/Recommendations

Based on the information presented in this brief, several actions/recommendations can be made:

1.  **Government Support:** Governments should provide policy support and resource allocation to facilitate the adoption of biochar-based agroforestry systems.
2.  **Private Sector Partnerships:** Private sector partnerships can help reduce costs and improve access to technology for farmers.
3.  **International Funding:** International funding agencies can provide financial support for scaling up the approach.

### Closing Outlook

Biochar-based agroforestry systems offer a promising solution to address climate-related challenges in Rwanda. Successful implementation of these systems can build long-term resilience against climate change impacts while addressing immediate needs. Further research and data collection are needed to fully understand the potential of this approach.
