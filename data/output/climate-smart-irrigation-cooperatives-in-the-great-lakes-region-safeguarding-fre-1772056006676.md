# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Great Lakes Region: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges. By investing in rainwater harvesting systems, expanding renewable energy projects, and strengthening community-based disaster response mechanisms, Sub-Saharan Africa can significantly enhance its environmental resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and resilient infrastructure to cope with climate change. With 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), the region lags far behind the world average. Additionally, only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), highlighting a critical need for sustainable and equitable solutions.

## Analysis

The current state of water security in Sub-Saharan Africa is dire. While over half of the region's population lacks access to safe drinking water, only about a quarter have access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). This disparity exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, particularly during droughts and climate-induced disruptions. Furthermore, limited renewable energy consumption ([VERIFY]%) hinders the adoption of sustainable solutions that could mitigate environmental impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

To improve water security and access to clean energy, we recommend:

1. **Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Implement large-scale rainwater harvesting projects in urban and rural areas to ensure a steady supply of potable water. These systems can be integrated with existing infrastructure for maximum efficiency.
2. **Renewable Energy Projects**: Invest in solar, wind, and hydro power generation facilities to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. This not only enhances energy security but also contributes to climate resilience by lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
3. **Community-Based Disaster Management**: Strengthen community-led initiatives such as watershed co-management with indigenous councils to enhance early warning systems and disaster preparedness.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure the successful implementation of these recommendations, several practical steps must be taken:

* Conduct cost-benefit analyses for each project to determine their financial viability.
* Establish partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities to pool resources and expertise.
* Train local communities in sustainable water management techniques and renewable energy technologies.

## Conclusion

By prioritizing the development of robust water security measures, promoting clean energy access, and fostering community-based climate resilience strategies, Sub-Saharan Africa can significantly improve its environmental resilience. This multi-faceted approach not only addresses immediate needs but also sets a foundation for long-term sustainability. It is imperative that policymakers prioritize these recommendations to ensure sustainable growth and prosperity in the region.
