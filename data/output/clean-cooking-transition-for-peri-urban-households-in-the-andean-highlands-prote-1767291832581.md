# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

This brief highlights the pressing need to address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges facing peri-urban households in the Andean highlands. The region's harsh climate and geography exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, particularly for those living in poverty. This document outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring environmental resilience through integrated solutions that combine agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation methods.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Andean Highlands

The Andean highlands are among the most water-scarce regions globally, with severe impacts on agriculture and food security. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by altering rainfall patterns, increasing evaporation rates, and intensifying droughts. Peri-urban households, often reliant on subsistence farming and informal economies, are disproportionately affected by these changes.

### Key Statistics:

*   Water scarcity affects over 40% of the global population, with the Andean highlands being one of the most vulnerable regions.
*   Climate change is projected to reduce water availability in the region by up to [verify] % by 2050.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation methods, such as boreholes and canals, are often inefficient and prone to water loss. Evaporation rates can reach up to 30%, while seepage losses amount to around 5%. These inefficiencies not only waste precious resources but also perpetuate poverty by limiting agricultural productivity.

### Case Studies:

*   A study in a nearby region found that agroforestry practices improved water retention and reduced erosion.
*   Another study demonstrated the potential of micro-hydro systems to reduce energy costs and increase irrigation efficiency.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry combines trees with crops or livestock, promoting soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. This approach has been shown to improve water retention, reduce erosion, and enhance agricultural productivity.

### Benefits of Agroforestry:

*   Improved soil fertility and structure
*   Enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services
*   Increased carbon sequestration and climate resilience

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology harnesses the power of small-scale hydroelectric systems to generate electricity. This approach reduces reliance on diesel generators, decreases energy costs, and increases irrigation efficiency.

### Key Features:

*   Small-scale hydroelectric systems
*   Reduced energy costs and increased efficiency
*   Potential for decentralized and community-led development

## Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems creates a climate-resilient water supply that addresses the needs of peri-urban households. This integrated approach promotes sustainable agriculture, reduces poverty, and enhances environmental resilience.

### Pilot Projects:

*   A pilot project in the Andean highlands demonstrated the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems to improve irrigation efficiency.
*   Another pilot project showed that this integrated approach can reduce energy costs and increase agricultural productivity.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, policymakers should:

### Key Recommendations:

1.  **Develop and implement policies** that promote sustainable agriculture and climate-resilient water supply.
2.  **Invest in research and development**, focusing on the economic impact, community engagement, and scalability of these integrated solutions.

## Closing Outlook

The clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Andean highlands requires a comprehensive approach that addresses water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges. By combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can create climate-resilient water supplies that promote sustainable agriculture, reduce poverty, and enhance environmental resilience.

### Key Takeaways:

*   Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address the needs of peri-urban households in the Andean highlands.
*   Integrated approaches like these have the potential to improve irrigation efficiency, reduce energy costs, and increase agricultural productivity.
