# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Horn of Africa: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing severe heatwaves and droughts that affect millions of people. The transition to clean cooking practices is essential for improving health outcomes, particularly in peri-urban areas where households rely heavily on traditional biomass fuels. This brief highlights the importance of integrated solutions addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Horn of Africa

The region's arid and semi-arid conditions are exacerbated by climate change, leading to severe droughts and heatwaves that impact agriculture, water resources, and human health. The population relies heavily on traditional biomass fuels for cooking, contributing to indoor air pollution and negative health outcomes.

## Current Cooking Practices and Challenges

*   Peri-urban households in the Horn of Africa primarily rely on biomass fuels (e.g., charcoal, firewood) for cooking.
*   These fuels are often obtained from unsustainable sources, leading to deforestation and soil degradation.
*   Indoor air pollution from biomass fuels affects human health, particularly among women and children who spend more time indoors.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate Resilience

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for addressing water scarcity and promoting climate resilience. These systems combine agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric power generation, providing a sustainable source of energy for irrigation and other household needs.

*   Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
*   Micro-hydro systems reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency.
*   Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems can improve water retention and reduce erosion.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households, we recommend:

1.  **Promote Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems**: Encourage adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems through pilot projects and policy incentives.
2.  **Improve Access to Clean Energy**: Invest in renewable energy infrastructure, including solar-powered cooking solutions and micro-grids.
3.  **Enhance Water Security**: Implement water conservation measures and promote efficient irrigation practices.

## Closing Outlook

The clean cooking transition is critical for improving health outcomes in peri-urban households in the Horn of Africa. By addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation through integrated solutions, we can reduce the region's vulnerability to heatwaves and droughts.
