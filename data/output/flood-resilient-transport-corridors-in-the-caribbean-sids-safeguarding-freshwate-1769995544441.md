**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Lower-Income Countries**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges in lower-income countries. Recent data from the World Bank shows that only 32.4% of people in Sub-Saharan Africa have access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of [73.7%] (World Bank Open Data). Moreover, electricity access stands at just [53.3%], significantly lower than the world's overall rate of [91.6%] (World Bank Open Data). To bridge these gaps, we recommend investing in solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting systems to enhance water security.

### Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant barriers in securing access to safe drinking water, electricity, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly challenged, with only [32.4%] of its population having access to safely managed drinking water compared to the global average of [73.7%] (World Bank Open Data). Similarly, just [53.3%] of people have access to electricity in this region, far below the World Bank's estimate of [91.6%] for the world as a whole (World Bank Open Data). These gaps are exacerbated by climate variability and extreme weather events, making it imperative to develop robust strategies that address these multifaceted challenges.

### Analysis

The current situation is characterized by persistent disparities in access to safe drinking water and clean energy sources across lower-income countries. According to recent data from the World Bank (2024), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only [32.4%] of its population having access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of [73.7%] (World Bank Open Data). Moreover, electricity access stands at just [53.3%], significantly lower than the world's overall rate of [91.6%] (World Bank Open Data).

In terms of renewable energy consumption, the world as a whole has achieved only [19.7%] in this critical area (World Bank Open Data). These statistics underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions and policy reforms to bridge these gaps effectively.

**Key Findings:**

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa ([32.4%]) vs World ([73.7%])
- **Electricity Access**: Sub-Saharan Africa ([53.3%]) vs World ([91.6%])
- **Renewable Energy Consumption**: World ([19.7%])

### Policy Recommendations

To address the critical challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, we recommend the following specific and actionable steps:

1. **Solar-Powered Wells**: Invest in solar-powered well projects to provide reliable and sustainable water sources for communities. This initiative can be scaled up through partnerships with local governments and NGOs.
2. **Rainwater Harvesting**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems to enhance water security, particularly in regions prone to droughts. Community-based initiatives can foster ownership and sustainability of these infrastructures.
3. **Clean Cooking Transition**: Promote clean cooking solutions such as biogas stoves or solar cookers for peri-urban households, reducing indoor air pollution and improving health outcomes.

### Implementation Considerations

To ensure successful implementation, it is crucial to consider the following practical steps:

1. **Cost Analysis**: Conduct detailed cost-benefit analyses to determine the financial feasibility of proposed initiatives.
2. **Community Engagement**: Involve local communities in planning and decision-making processes to enhance ownership and sustainability of projects.
3. **Policy Support**: Advocate for supportive policies, including subsidies for renewable energy sources and incentives for water-efficient technologies.

### Conclusion

Lower-income countries face significant barriers in securing access to safe drinking water, electricity, and climate-resilient infrastructure. By adopting evidence-based interventions such as solar-powered wells, rainwater harvesting, and clean cooking solutions, we can make substantial progress toward bridging these critical gaps. Collaborative efforts between governments, NGOs, and communities are essential for the successful implementation of these initiatives.

**Call to Action**: Governments, development organizations, and civil society must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. By doing so, they can contribute significantly to improving living conditions and contributing to global sustainability goals.

### Key Data Points:

- Access to safely managed drinking water: Sub-Saharan Africa ([32.4%]), World ([73.7%]) [Source: World Bank Open Data]
- Electricity access: Sub-Saharan Africa ([53.3%]), World ([91.6%]) [Source: World Bank Open Data]
- Renewable energy consumption: World ([19.7%]) [Source: World Bank Open Data]

By focusing on these specific angles and evidence, we can develop targeted strategies that not only address immediate needs but also lay the groundwork for long-term resilience in lower-income countries.
