Here's the revised brief:

# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Indus Watershed: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Indus watershed is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, facing severe climate-related challenges that exacerbate poverty and food insecurity. This brief explores integrated solutions to address these issues, focusing on agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in lower-income countries.

## Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture and Water Scarcity

Climate change has significant implications for agriculture in the Indus watershed, leading to reduced crop yields and increased poverty. Existing irrigation systems are inefficient, with notable water loss issues [verify].

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

* Boreholes and canals are primary irrigation sources in the Indus watershed.
* Water loss percentages from these systems: [verify]
	+ Evaporation
	+ Seepage
* Climate change exacerbates water scarcity, reducing crop yields and increasing poverty.

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry offers numerous benefits for soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry improves water retention:

* [Case Study 1]: Improved water retention through agroforestry practices.
* [Case Study 2]: Reduced erosion through integrated agroforestry and conservation agriculture.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology (small-scale hydroelectric systems) offers several benefits, including reduced reliance on diesel generators:

* Overview of micro-hydro technology
* Benefits:
	+ Reduced reliance on diesel generators
	+ Increased energy efficiency

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects showcase the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro, demonstrating potential for scaling up:

* Pilot project 1: Reduced water loss through integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro.
* Pilot project 2: Increased energy efficiency through micro-hydro technology.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support adoption at scale, we recommend the following policy actions:

* Develop policies supporting agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems
* Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers and community leaders
* Encourage private sector investment in climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure

Future research directions include:

* Economic impact analysis of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems
* Community engagement and social impact assessments

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Develop policy frameworks** supporting the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Provide training and capacity-building programs** for farmers and community leaders.
3. **Encourage private sector investment** in climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are critical for vulnerable groups in the Indus watershed. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can reduce disaster losses and improve water security. This brief highlights the need for innovative solutions to address climate-related challenges in lower-income countries.

Changes made:

* Removed speculative claims and numbers lacking sources
