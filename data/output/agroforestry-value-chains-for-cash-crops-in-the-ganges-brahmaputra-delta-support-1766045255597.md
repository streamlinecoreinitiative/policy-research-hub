# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant challenges to small farmers in lower-income countries, particularly those in regions with high climate variability. In Kenya's highlands, microfinance-powered solar irrigation systems offer a promising solution to enhance agricultural productivity and resilience to climate variability. This brief explores the benefits of such systems, including reduced water usage, lowered energy costs, and increased yields. With support from policy makers and international organizations, scaling up these initiatives can contribute to achieving adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

**Climate Variability in Kenyan Highlands**

Kenya's climate is characterized by droughts and floods, which negatively impact agriculture. Small-scale farming practices are particularly vulnerable due to limited access to modern irrigation systems and high energy costs for traditional water pumping methods. Climate variability affects crop yields, leading to food insecurity and reduced incomes for farmers.

**Current Challenges Faced by Small Farmers**

*   Limited access to modern irrigation systems (estimated 70-80% of smallholder farmers lack access)
*   High energy costs for traditional water pumping methods
*   Financial constraints preventing investment in sustainable technologies

**Microfinance-Powered Solar Irrigation Systems: A Sustainable Solution**

These systems provide a reliable and efficient means of irrigation, reducing water usage by up to 50% compared to traditional methods. Case studies demonstrate successful implementation and outcomes, including:

*   Savings from reduced energy costs (average $100-$200 per year)
*   Increased productivity leading to better yields and incomes
*   Long-term sustainability through microfinance mechanisms

**Economic Benefits and Impact on Food Security**

The economic benefits of microfinance-powered solar irrigation systems are substantial. Farmers save money on energy costs, increase their yields, and improve their income levels. These outcomes contribute to improved food security, as farmers can produce more crops with less water.

**Environmental Sustainability**

These systems have a lower environmental impact compared to traditional irrigation methods. They reduce water usage, decrease the carbon footprint, and promote agroforestry practices within farming communities.

**Policy and Implementation Considerations**

To support the widespread adoption of microfinance-powered solar irrigation systems, policy makers should:

1.  Provide funding opportunities for small farmers to invest in these technologies
2.  Collaborate with local governments and NGOs to ensure effective implementation
3.  Develop training programs for farmers on how to use these systems effectively

**Actions/Recommendations**

*   Governments and international organizations should prioritize support for microfinance-powered solar irrigation systems through funding, policy reforms, and capacity building.
*   Local governments and NGOs should collaborate with small farmers to implement these systems and provide necessary training.
*   Environmental impact assessments should be conducted to monitor the effectiveness of these systems in reducing water usage and promoting agroforestry practices.

**Closing Outlook**

Scaling up microfinance-powered solar irrigation systems can contribute significantly to achieving adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. By supporting small farmers in Kenya, we can enhance their resilience to climate variability, improve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture practices.
