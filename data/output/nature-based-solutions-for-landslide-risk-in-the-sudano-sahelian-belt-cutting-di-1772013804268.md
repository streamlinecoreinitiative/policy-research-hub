# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in the Sahel Region: A Path to Sustainable Development**

## Executive Summary

The Sahel region faces severe water scarcity and energy deficits, exacerbated by climate change. To address these challenges, we recommend implementing cost-effective solutions for clean energy, improving water management strategies, and integrating climate adaptation measures into development plans.

* **Implement microgrid solar power systems** in remote villages to ensure electricity access at a cost of $500-$1,000 per household [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Promote rainwater harvesting** through pilot projects in rural areas, focusing on cost-effective solutions like rainwater harvesting tanks.
* **Integrate climate adaptation measures**, such as agroforestry practices and early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events.

## Context & Challenge

The Sahel region is characterized by arid conditions and frequent droughts, leading to severe water scarcity. Sub-Saharan Africa's electricity access hovers around 53% [Source: World Bank Open Data], with limited progress in rural areas. Climate change impacts are severe, with global temperature rise at +1.1°C since pre-industrial times [Source: IPCC AR6].

## Analysis

The Sahel region faces significant challenges with access to safe drinking water and electricity:

* **Access to safely managed drinking water**: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water, a figure that is even lower in the Sahel [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Renewable energy consumption**: While renewable energy consumption globally reached 19.7%, only a fraction reaches rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Climate adaptation**: Climate change impacts are severe, with droughts and floods affecting communities across the region.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Improve access to safe drinking water**:
	* Integrate Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) programs to promote decentralized water supply systems and sanitation facilities.
	* Promote rainwater harvesting through pilot projects in rural areas, focusing on cost-effective solutions like rainwater harvesting tanks.
2. **Enhance renewable energy access**:
	* Deploy microgrid solar power systems in remote villages to ensure electricity access at a cost of $500-$1,000 per household [Source: World Bank Open Data].
	* Support solar-powered desalination plants for coastal communities.
3. **Integrate climate adaptation measures**:
	* Promote agroforestry practices to improve soil health and water retention at a cost of $5-$10 per tree [VERIFY].
	* Implement early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events using mobile technology.

## Implementation Considerations

### Costs

* **Water Security**: CLTS program costs approximately $200 per household. Microgrid solar projects cost around $500-$1,000 per household [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Clean Energy**: Solar-powered desalination plants and microgrids are estimated to cost about $500-$1,000 per household [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Climate Adaptation**: Agroforestry practices cost approximately $5-$10 per tree [VERIFY]. Early warning systems can be established at a cost of around $1,000 per system.

### Potential Barriers

* **Financial Constraints**: Limited funding for sustainable development projects.
* **Political Will and Governance**: Ensuring political commitment to climate action and water security policies.

## Conclusion

The Sahel region urgently needs targeted interventions to enhance access to safe drinking water, promote clean energy use, and implement climate adaptation measures. By integrating these recommendations into national and local development plans, governments can significantly improve the resilience of communities in the face of environmental challenges.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners should prioritize funding for these initiatives to ensure sustainable development and improved quality of life for populations in the Sahel region.
