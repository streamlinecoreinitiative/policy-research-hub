**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Andean highlands face severe water scarcity due to climate change impacts, affecting agriculture and food security. This brief explores integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems as a solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

**Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Andean Highlands**

### **Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Andean Highlands**

The Andean highlands are vulnerable to climate change impacts on agriculture, including erratic rainfall patterns. Resilient irrigation methods are crucial for food security and economic stability. Climate data indicates that the region has experienced changes in rainfall patterns over the past decade.

### **Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems suffer from water loss through evaporation and seepage, leading to inefficient use of resources and decreased crop yields.

### **Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry benefits include improved soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry systems improve water retention and reduce erosion.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency and Integration**

### **Micro-Hydro Technology Overview**

Micro-hydro technology involves small-scale hydroelectric systems that can be integrated with agroforestry to provide efficient irrigation solutions.

### **Benefits of Micro-Hydro and Agroforestry Combination**

The combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro demonstrates improved water retention, reduced erosion, and increased energy efficiency.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

### **Policy Support for Adoption at Scale**

Recommendations include policy support for integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects, focusing on cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

### **Future Research Directions**

Suggested areas for further research include economic impact analysis, community engagement studies, and exploring the integration of renewable energy sources with micro-hydro systems.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Support policy reforms to encourage adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
2.  Conduct socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these solutions.
3.  Explore opportunities for scaling up pilot projects through partnerships with local governments, NGOs, or private sector entities.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Andean highlands offer a promising solution to address water scarcity while promoting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can improve resilience, increase efficiency, and support economic stability for local communities.
