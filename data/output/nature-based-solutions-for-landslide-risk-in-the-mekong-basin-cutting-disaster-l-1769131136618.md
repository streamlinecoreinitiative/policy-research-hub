# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong basin: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Mekong Basin: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing unprecedented challenges from climate change, with limited access to clean water and electricity exacerbating these issues. Our analysis reveals that only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), while electricity access stands at 53.3% (World Bank, 2023). To address these pressing challenges, we recommend implementing targeted interventions to reduce water loss in secondary cities and providing subsidies or vouchers for households in peri-urban areas to purchase clean cooking fuels like LPG or biogas stoves.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. The region's limited access to safe drinking water and electricity hinders economic development and exacerbates health risks (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). Climate-related events such as droughts and floods are becoming more frequent and severe, putting immense pressure on already strained water resources.

According to the World Bank Open Data, Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water. Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed water (World Bank, 2024), leading to health risks such as diarrhea and other diseases. Electricity access is also a major challenge, with only [VERIFY] 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). This limits economic opportunities and further compounds water scarcity issues during droughts.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water. Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed water (World Bank, 2024), leading to health risks such as diarrhea and other diseases. Water loss reduction strategies can help address this issue.

### Clean Energy Access

Electricity access is also a major challenge, with only [VERIFY] 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). This limits economic opportunities and further compounds water scarcity issues during droughts.

### Climate Adaptation

Increased climate variability and extreme weather events are impacting agricultural productivity and food security (NOAA Climate Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities**
   - Implement targeted interventions to reduce water loss in secondary cities by [VERIFY] 30% within the next five years.

2. **Universal Access to Clean Cooking Fuels for Peri-Urban Households**
   - Provide subsidies or vouchers to households in peri-urban areas to purchase clean cooking fuels like LPG or biogas stoves.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Funding and Resources**: Allocate [VERIFY] $50 million for water loss reduction projects in secondary cities and [VERIFY] $30 million for clean cooking initiatives in peri-urban areas over three years.
2. **Technical Assistance**: Provide training to local government officials on best practices for water management and energy efficiency.
3. **Sustainable Financing Mechanisms**: Explore partnerships with private sector entities like solar companies, NGOs, and development finance institutions for financing these projects.

## Conclusion

By focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, Sub-Saharan Africa can build a more resilient future. Let us take action to ensure universal access to safe drinking water and electricity, and support sustainable practices that minimize the impact of climate change.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must collaborate to implement these recommendations within their respective jurisdictions. Early adoption will help mitigate the worst impacts of climate change and enhance the well-being of vulnerable populations in Sub-Saharan Africa.
