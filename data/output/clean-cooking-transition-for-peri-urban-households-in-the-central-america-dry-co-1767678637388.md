# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and increased frequency of droughts. This brief focuses on supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by promoting clean cooking transition for peri-urban households through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries

### Water Security Challenges

* Climate Change Impacts:
	+ Erratic rainfall patterns leading to reduced water availability.
	+ Increased evaporation from wetlands exacerbating water scarcity issues.
* Economic Challenges: [verify] Labor costs for constructing and maintaining irrigation systems are high, but specific figures are not provided.

### Current Irrigation Practices

* Traditional Systems:
	+ Boreholes and canals used for water delivery.
	+ Significant water loss due to poor canal design (evaporation and seepage).
* Economic Costs: [verify] Diesel generator maintenance costs are mentioned, but specific amounts are not provided.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

### Soil Health Benefits

* Improved soil structure with increased moisture retention.
* Examples of successful agroforestry projects demonstrating improved water retention and reduced erosion (Case Study 1, Case Study 2).

### Biodiversity Enhancement

* Increased biodiversity leading to natural pest control and pollination services.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency and Energy Savings

### Overview of Micro-Hydro Technology

* Renewable energy source for irrigation systems.
* Examples of successful micro-hydro projects showing improved water delivery.

### Energy Savings and Cost Reductions

* [verify] Potential savings from reduced reliance on diesel generators are mentioned, but specific amounts are not provided.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro

### Integrated Systems Implementation

* Pilot projects showing increased crop yields.
* Reduced dependency on external energy sources due to self-sufficient renewable energy supply (Project 1, Project 2).

### Economic Benefits

* [verify] Potential savings from reduced fuel and maintenance costs are mentioned, but specific amounts are not provided.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

### Subsidies and Grants

* Government subsidies for micro-hydro system installation, but specific details on subsidy amounts or percentages are not provided.

### Infrastructure Development

* Community-led micro-hydro system installations with local government support.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1. **Develop and implement NDCs** that prioritize clean cooking transition through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Establish subsidies and grants** for peri-urban households to adopt these integrated systems.
3. **Support community-led infrastructure development**, ensuring local ownership and decision-making processes.

## Closing Outlook

The Central America dry corridor faces significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity and increased frequency of droughts. By promoting the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for peri-urban households, we can enhance both water security and renewable energy use, improving agricultural resilience for vulnerable communities. This brief has provided evidence on the benefits of these integrated systems and highlighted policy recommendations to support adaptation targets in NDCs.
