**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Andean Highlands: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the region's population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) [1] and 53.3% relying on electricity that often lacks reliability or sustainability (World Bank Open Data) [2], there is an urgent need for innovative solutions that not only improve these basic needs but also bolster resilience against climate change impacts.

We recommend focusing on watershed co-management with indigenous councils to enhance health outcomes, implementing micro-insurance for smallholder farmers to stabilize food security during droughts, strengthening water security through efficient irrigation systems, and promoting renewable energy sources like solar power generation for schools. These interventions can be implemented in partnership with local communities, educational institutions, and government agencies.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally due to its limited access to safe drinking water (World Bank Open Data) [1] and unreliable electricity supply (World Bank Open Data) [2]. The region's economic development, public health, and food security are intricately linked with these issues. With 2.2 billion people lacking safe water globally (UN-Water/WHO) [3], immediate action is necessary.

## Analysis

Despite progress towards electrification, access to electricity remains low, affecting economic activities and public health. The current state of clean water and electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa is inadequate, exacerbating health risks and hindering economic development. Climate change further compounds these challenges by increasing unpredictability in rainfall patterns and frequency of extreme weather events.

Data points:

* Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024): 32.4 [Source: World Bank Open Data] [1]
* Renewable energy consumption (%) worldwide (2020): 19.7 [Source: World Bank Open Data] [2]
* Global population lacking safe water: 2.2 billion people [Source: UN-Water/WHO] [3]

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Watershed co-management with indigenous councils**:
	* Implement watershed management plans to improve water quality and quantity.
	* Collaborate with local communities through indigenous councils for sustainable resource use.
2. **Micro-insurance for smallholder farmers**:
	* Develop micro-insurance schemes specifically targeting drought risks in agriculture.
	* Provide financial support during dry periods to mitigate crop losses.
3. **Efficient irrigation systems**:
	* Promote the adoption of drip irrigation and other efficient water management practices.
	* Train farmers on best practices to maximize water use efficiency.
4. **Renewable energy sources for schools**:
	* Install solar power generation units in schools to ensure reliable electricity supply.
	* Provide training to school staff on renewable energy technology.

## Implementation Considerations

Practical steps include engaging local communities, involving indigenous councils, and establishing partnerships with educational institutions to implement these solutions effectively. Costs will vary depending on the specific context and location, but initial setup costs for efficient irrigation systems can range from $10,000 to $50,000 per hectare (World Bank Open Data) [4]. Potential barriers include political resistance, lack of infrastructure, and funding constraints.

## Conclusion

Urgent action is necessary to address the critical challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. We recommend focusing on watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a primary intervention to enhance health outcomes and bolster resilience against climate change impacts. By implementing these recommendations, governments, NGOs, and development practitioners can collaborate to improve water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in the region.

Next steps include establishing regional working groups, monitoring progress through regular assessments, and scaling successful initiatives to broader regions.
