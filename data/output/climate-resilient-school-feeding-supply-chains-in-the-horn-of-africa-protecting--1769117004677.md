**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, with frequent droughts and floods affecting food security and livelihoods. To address this challenge, we recommend establishing climate-resilient school feeding supply chains that integrate water harvesting systems, solar-powered cooking facilities, and climate information services. This approach will not only improve nutrition for students but also enhance the resilience of local communities to climate-related shocks.

### Context & Challenge

The Horn of Africa is home to over 100 million people, with [VERIFY] living in poverty (World Bank Open Data, 2022). Climate variability has severe impacts on agriculture, leading to crop failures and reduced yields. In Ethiopia alone, the 2015-2016 drought affected [NEEDS SOURCE] people, resulting in significant food insecurity (FAO, 2017). The region's limited access to safe drinking water ([VERIFY]% of the population) and electricity ([VERIFY]%) exacerbates these challenges (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

### Analysis

Climate change has severe implications for school feeding programs in the Horn of Africa. Droughts and floods can lead to food shortages, compromising nutrition and education outcomes. A study by the World Food Programme found that children in drought-affected areas are more likely to experience stunting and wasting (WFP, 2020). To address these challenges, we must integrate climate-resilient practices into school feeding supply chains.

### Policy Recommendations

To enhance water security, promote clean energy access, and foster climate resilience in the Horn of Africa:

1. **Establish Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains**: Integrate water harvesting systems, solar-powered cooking facilities, and climate information services to improve nutrition and enhance community resilience.
2. **Promote Water Conservation**: Implement rainwater harvesting systems and greywater reuse to reduce water stress in schools.
3. **Invest in Renewable Energy**: Install solar-powered cooking facilities and energy-efficient lighting to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require strategic planning, collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities. Costs associated with climate-resilient infrastructure are moderate compared to potential long-term benefits in terms of improved health outcomes and sustainable economic growth (World Bank Open Data, 2022).

### Conclusion

Ensuring water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is critical for the Horn of Africa's development. By establishing climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, we can protect livelihoods under climate stress and improve nutrition for students.
