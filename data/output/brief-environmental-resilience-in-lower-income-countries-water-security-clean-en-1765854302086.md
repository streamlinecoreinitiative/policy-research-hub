# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

**Executive Summary**

This policy brief highlights the pressing need for environmental resilience in lower-income countries, focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. The brief provides an overview of the current state of these sectors, identifies key challenges and opportunities, and offers policy recommendations for governments, international organizations, and development partners.

**Section 1: Water Security Challenges**

Understanding the current state of water resources is crucial for developing effective strategies to address water security challenges in lower-income countries. The following data points are essential:

* Current access to clean drinking water (%): [Data needed]
* Percentage of population with adequate sanitation facilities: [Data needed]
* Annual rainfall variability in key regions: [Data needed]

Sources to consult include the World Bank Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) reports and UNICEF’s Global Monitoring Report on Water Supply and Sanitation.

**Section 2: Clean Energy Solutions for Lower-Income Countries**

Access to clean energy is essential for reducing carbon footprints and improving livelihoods in lower-income countries. Key data points include:

* Proportion of population with access to electricity (%): [Data needed]
* Installed renewable energy capacity (MW): [Data needed]
* Average cost per kWh for renewable vs. non-renewable sources: [Data needed]

Sources to consult include the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook and OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) data on clean energy investments.

**Section 3: Climate Adaptation Strategies in Lower-Income Countries**

Effective climate adaptation measures are critical for protecting vulnerable populations in lower-income countries. Key data points include:

* Number of people affected by extreme weather events (%): [Data needed]
* Percentage of GDP spent on disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM): [Data needed]
* Proportion of agricultural land at risk from climate change: [Data needed]

Sources to consult include the World Bank Disaster Risk Management Database and OECD DAC’s Development Assistance Committee data on DRRM.

**Section 4: Economic Impacts of Environmental Resilience Initiatives**

Understanding economic impacts can help secure funding and support for resilience projects. Key data points include:

* Cost-benefit analysis of water security investments: [Data needed]
* Employment generation potential from clean energy projects: [Data needed]
* Reduction in healthcare costs due to improved sanitation: [Data needed]

Sources to consult include the World Bank’s Environmental Economics and Governance (EEG) reports and OECD DAC’s Development Assistance Committee data on economic impacts.

**Section 5: Policy Recommendations for Environmental Resilience**

Based on the evidence, specific policy recommendations can guide implementation. Key data points include:

* Current government spending allocation to environmental sectors (%): [Data needed]
* Success stories of successful resilience projects in similar contexts: [Data needed]

Sources to consult include UN Environment’s Global Environmental Outlook (GEO) reports and OECD DAC’s Development Assistance Committee data on best practices.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Governments should allocate at least 10% of their budget to environmental sectors, including water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.
2. International organizations and development partners should prioritize investments in clean energy and climate adaptation initiatives.
3. Countries should develop and implement cost-benefit analyses for water security and clean energy projects.
4. Governments should establish disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) frameworks to protect vulnerable populations.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience is critical for the sustainable development of lower-income countries. This policy brief highlights key challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for governments, international organizations, and development partners. Further research is needed to address identified knowledge gaps and inform evidence-based policy decisions.
