**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

This brief addresses the pressing issue of urban heat mitigation in the Great Lakes region, a critical aspect of climate adaptation and resilience building. The focus is on cool roofs as a cost-effective solution to reduce urban heat islands, improve energy efficiency, and enhance public health. This approach supports the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of countries in the region by providing actionable recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders.

**Section 1: Introduction to Urban Heat Islands**

Urban heat islands are a significant concern in the Great Lakes region, particularly during hot summer months. The increasing frequency and severity of heatwaves pose substantial risks to human health, infrastructure, and economic development. Cool roofs have been identified as a promising solution to mitigate urban heat islands by reducing surface temperatures and energy consumption.

**Key Data Points:**

* Average temperature increase in urban areas compared to surrounding rural areas (°C): [verify]
	+ 1-3°C (average)
	+ 5-7°C (extreme cases)
* Energy consumption savings through cool roofs (%): [verify]
	+ 10-20% (residential buildings)
	+ 15-30% (commercial buildings)

**Section 2: Cool Roofs as a Climate Adaptation Strategy**

Cool roofs are a simple yet effective solution to reduce urban heat islands. By using reflective and emissive materials, cool roofs can:

* Reduce surface temperatures
* Decrease energy consumption

**Case Studies:**

* City A: Cool roof implementation resulted in a 15% reduction in energy consumption.
* City B: Cool roof installation led to a significant decrease in surface temperature.

**Section 3: Policy Recommendations for Cool Roof Implementation**

To support the adoption of cool roofs in the Great Lakes region, we recommend:

1. **Incentives for building owners**: Provide financial incentives or tax credits to encourage building owners to install cool roofs.
2. **Building codes and regulations**: Update local building codes and regulations to require cool roof installation in new construction projects.
3. **Public awareness campaigns**: Launch public awareness campaigns to educate residents and businesses about the benefits of cool roofs.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of urban heat islands in the Great Lakes region.
2. Develop a cool roof implementation plan for local governments and building owners.
3. Establish partnerships with industry stakeholders, NGOs, and community groups to promote cool roof adoption.

**Closing Outlook**

The adoption of cool roofs is a critical step towards mitigating urban heat islands and enhancing climate resilience in the Great Lakes region. By supporting NDCs and promoting cost-effective solutions like cool roofs, we can reduce energy consumption and public health risks associated with urban heat islands.
