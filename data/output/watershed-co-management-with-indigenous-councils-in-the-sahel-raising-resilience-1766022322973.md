**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sahel: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

Executive Summary:

The Ethiopian Highlands are among the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, particularly erratic rainfall patterns and soil degradation. Smallholder farmers rely heavily on rain-fed systems, making them susceptible to droughts and reduced crop yields. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry practices in enhancing water security and promoting sustainable land management for these communities. By integrating agroforestry into existing farming systems, we can increase resilience to climate change while improving agricultural productivity.

**Climate Change Impacts in Ethiopian Highlands**

The Ethiopian Highlands are characterized by a subtropical highland climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. However, climate change is altering this pattern, leading to more frequent droughts and erratic rainfall (1). This has significant implications for agriculture, which accounts for 80% of Ethiopia's employment opportunities and 40% of its GDP (2). Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on rain-fed systems, making them susceptible to climate-related shocks.

**Current Agricultural Practices and Challenges**

Traditional farming methods in the Ethiopian Highlands often rely on rainwater for irrigation. However, this approach is becoming increasingly unsustainable due to soil erosion and reduced water retention capacity (3). Farmers face significant challenges, including:

• Drought resilience: Erratic rainfall patterns make it difficult for farmers to predict when crops will be ready for harvest.
• Soil erosion: Intensive farming practices lead to soil degradation, reducing fertility and increasing the risk of landslides.
• Limited access to credit: Smallholder farmers often lack the financial resources to invest in climate-resilient agricultural practices.

**Agroforestry as a Solution**

Agroforestry involves integrating trees into existing farming systems. This approach has numerous benefits for water security, including:

• Improved soil health: Tree roots help maintain soil moisture levels and reduce erosion.
• Enhanced biodiversity: Agroforestry promotes the growth of native plant species, increasing ecosystem resilience.
• Climate change mitigation: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Case studies from other regions with similar climate conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in enhancing water security. For example, a project in Kenya's Lake Victoria Basin saw a 30% increase in maize yields and a 25% reduction in soil erosion (4).

**Scaling Up Agroforestry Value Chains**

To promote adoption among smallholder farmers, we recommend:

• Training programs: Provide capacity-building initiatives for local agricultural extension agents to train farmers on agroforestry practices.
• Financial incentives: Offer subsidies or low-interest loans to support the adoption of climate-resilient agricultural practices.
• Collaboration with local governments and NGOs: Facilitate partnerships between stakeholders to promote policy changes and resource mobilization.

**Economic Impact and Sustainability**

Agroforestry systems offer several economic benefits, including:

• Increased crop yields: Agroforestry practices can increase maize yields by up to 30% (5).
• Reduced input costs: By reducing soil erosion and improving water retention capacity, farmers can save on fertilizers and irrigation costs.
• Long-term sustainability: Agroforestry promotes ecosystem services that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance biodiversity.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Support policy reforms**: Encourage governments to adopt policies promoting agroforestry practices and providing incentives for smallholder farmers.
2. **Invest in capacity-building initiatives**: Provide training programs for agricultural extension agents and farmers on agroforestry practices.
3. **Mobilize resources**: Facilitate partnerships between stakeholders to mobilize financial and technical resources for agroforestry projects.

**Closing Outlook**

The Ethiopian Highlands are facing significant climate-related challenges, particularly erratic rainfall patterns and soil degradation. Agroforestry practices offer a promising solution for enhancing water security while promoting sustainable land management. By scaling up agroforestry value chains, we can improve the resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change while contributing to long-term sustainability and economic development.
