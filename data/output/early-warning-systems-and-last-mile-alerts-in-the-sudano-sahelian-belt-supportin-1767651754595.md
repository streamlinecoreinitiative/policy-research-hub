# Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity and energy insecurity in lower-income countries, particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. This brief highlights the importance of early-warning systems and last-mile alerts for supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We propose integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance both water security and renewable energy use, improving agricultural resilience for vulnerable communities.

## Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts

Climate change alters precipitation patterns, leading to reduced water availability and increased evaporation from wetlands. This has severe economic consequences, including high labor costs for constructing and maintaining irrigation systems. In the Sudano-Sahelian belt, traditional irrigation practices result in significant water loss due to poor canal design.

## Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Current irrigation practices rely heavily on boreholes and canals, with significant economic costs associated with maintenance and energy consumption. The high labor costs for constructing and maintaining irrigation systems exacerbate water scarcity issues.

## Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry plays a crucial role in enhancing soil health and biodiversity. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, agroforestry improves soil structure, increases moisture retention, and reduces erosion. Successful agroforestry projects demonstrate improved water retention and reduced erosion.

## Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency and Energy Savings

Micro-hydro technology provides a renewable energy source for irrigation systems, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Successful micro-hydro projects show improved water delivery and significant energy savings.

## Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro

Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems enhances both water security and renewable energy use. Pilot projects demonstrate increased crop yields and reduced dependency on external energy sources.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1. **Subsidies and Grants:** Governments should consider providing subsidies for micro-hydro system installation.
2. **Infrastructure Development:** Community-led micro-hydro system installations with local government support can ensure long-term sustainability.
3. **Capacity Building:** Training programs for farmers, government officials, and environmental experts are essential for effective implementation.

## Closing Outlook

Early-warning systems and last-mile alerts are critical components of climate adaptation strategies in lower-income countries. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water security and renewable energy use, improving agricultural resilience for vulnerable communities. Governments, international organizations, and local stakeholders must work together to support the implementation of these integrated systems.
