# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and frequent flooding. This brief highlights the importance of addressing these challenges through integrated approaches that combine agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation efficiency.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in Secondary Cities of the Lower Mekong Delta

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in secondary cities of the Lower Mekong delta. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns lead to erratic rainfall and increased evaporation rates, making irrigation a significant challenge for agriculture and urban water supply.

*   Climate data from NOAA shows that average annual rainfall has decreased by [verify]% in the past decade.
*   Water scarcity affects over [verify] people, with many relying on boreholes and canals for irrigation.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems are often inefficient, leading to significant water loss through evaporation and seepage. Diesel generators power many of these systems, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and energy insecurity.

*   Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in reducing water loss and increasing energy efficiency.
*   However, scaling up these solutions requires policy support and investment in infrastructure development.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices promote soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, communities can enhance water retention and reduce erosion.

*   Research shows that agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can increase crop yields by up to [verify]%.
*   However, more studies are needed to validate the long-term sustainability of these integrated solutions.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in secondary cities of the Lower Mekong delta, policymakers should:

*   Provide subsidies and low-interest loans for communities to invest in infrastructure development.
*   Offer training and capacity-building programs for farmers and water managers on sustainable irrigation practices.
*   Develop and implement policies that promote energy efficiency and renewable energy use.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Develop a regional policy framework** that supports the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in secondary cities of the Lower Mekong delta.
2.  **Establish a community-led initiative** to promote sustainable irrigation practices and reduce water loss through integrated approaches.
3.  **Conduct further research** on the long-term sustainability and economic viability of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

Addressing climate change in secondary cities of the Lower Mekong delta requires innovative solutions that balance environmental, social, and economic needs. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, communities can reduce water loss, enhance energy security, and promote climate resilience. With policy support and investment in infrastructure development, these integrated approaches can be scaled up to benefit millions of people in the region.
