**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Central America Dry Corridor: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief outlines a critical intervention to protect fisheries livelihoods in the Central America dry corridor, where climate stress is exacerbating water scarcity and energy insecurity. We recommend implementing solar-powered cold-chain systems for fish storage and transportation, which can reduce post-harvest losses by up to 30% (FAO, 2020). This approach requires a collaborative effort between governments, NGOs, and local communities to invest in renewable energy infrastructure and provide technical support to small-scale fishing communities.

### Context & Challenge

The Central America dry corridor is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, with frequent droughts and heatwaves affecting agricultural productivity and water availability (World Bank Open Data, 2022). The region's fisheries sector is particularly vulnerable, with an estimated [VERIFY] % of fish stocks at risk due to overfishing and climate change (FAO, 2018). Small-scale fishing communities rely heavily on traditional ice-based cold-chain systems, which are often unreliable and energy-intensive. This has led to significant post-harvest losses, affecting the livelihoods of thousands of people.

### Analysis

The region's water security crisis is exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and management practices. Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), compared to a global average of [VERIFY] % (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This disparity is due to factors like poor sanitation facilities, lack of investment in water supply systems, and insufficient rainwater harvesting ponds.

In terms of clean energy access, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind globally. Only 53.3% have access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023), compared to a global average of [VERIFY] % (World Bank Open Data, 2023). This disparity is partly due to the region's reliance on fossil fuels for energy production and distribution.

Climate adaptation efforts are also lagging behind. Only 19.7% of total final energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa comes from renewable sources (World Bank Open Data, 2020), compared to a global average of [VERIFY] % (IEA, 2020). This underutilization of renewables can lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions and further exacerbate climate impacts.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Implement Solar-Powered Cold-Chain Systems**: Invest in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fish storage and transportation, targeting small-scale fishing communities in the Central America dry corridor.
2. **Enhance Renewable Energy Access**: Increase government subsidies for renewable energy technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines in Sub-Saharan Africa's power grids.
3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early warning systems using climate data from NOAA (e.g., PRCP/TMAX) to enhance disaster risk management.
4. **Support Community-Based Initiatives**: Empower indigenous councils in watershed co-management initiatives, which can enhance local knowledge of climate resilience strategies and ensure long-term sustainability.

### Implementation Considerations

The implementation of these recommendations will require a multi-faceted approach involving collaboration between governments, NGOs, local communities, and international partners. Key considerations include securing adequate funding (e.g., from the Green Climate Fund), ensuring equitable distribution of resources across different regions, and promoting community participation in project design and management.

### Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires targeted interventions that leverage available evidence and data to ensure sustainable outcomes. By focusing on these key areas, governments can significantly improve the lives of millions living in poverty while contributing positively to global efforts towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
