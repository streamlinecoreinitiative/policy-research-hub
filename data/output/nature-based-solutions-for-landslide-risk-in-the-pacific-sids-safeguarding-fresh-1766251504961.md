# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Pacific SIDS: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Pacific SIDS: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

### Executive Summary

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to climate-related natural hazards, including landslides and freshwater ecosystem degradation. This brief highlights the importance of integrating nature-based solutions (NBS) into disaster risk reduction and management strategies in these regions.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Pacific SIDS

The Pacific SIDS face significant challenges due to limited freshwater resources, making them highly susceptible to water scarcity and related social, economic, and environmental impacts. Climate change exacerbates these challenges through increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods, which can trigger landslides and damage freshwater ecosystems.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges in the Mesoamerican Highlands

Existing irrigation systems in the Mesoamerican Highlands rely heavily on boreholes and canals, resulting in significant water losses due to evaporation and seepage. The exact percentages of these losses are unclear [verify].

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to enhance soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while improving water retention and reducing erosion. Case studies from the Mesoamerican Highlands demonstrate that agroforestry can improve crop yields and reduce water consumption.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a low-cost, renewable energy solution for irrigation systems in the Mesoamerican Highlands. By harnessing local water resources, micro-hydro systems can reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems have demonstrated cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods. The exact percentage of these savings is unclear [verify].

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the widespread adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in the Mesoamerican Highlands:

1. **Develop and implement policies** that incentivize the use of NBS for disaster risk reduction and management.
2. **Invest in capacity building** to enhance local communities' understanding, planning, and implementation capacities.
3. **Conduct further research** on economic impact, community engagement, and scalability of these solutions.

### Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct a thorough assessment of existing irrigation systems in the Mesoamerican Highlands to identify areas for improvement.
2. Develop and disseminate guidelines for integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems at scale.
3. Establish partnerships between local communities, governments, and international organizations to support pilot projects and knowledge sharing.

### Closing Outlook

The Pacific SIDS face significant challenges in addressing climate-related natural hazards, including landslides and freshwater ecosystem degradation. By integrating nature-based solutions (NBS) into disaster risk reduction and management strategies, these regions can build resilience, promote sustainable development, and safeguard freshwater ecosystems for future generations.
