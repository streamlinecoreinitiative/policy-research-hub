**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Andean Highlands: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary
To protect livelihoods under climate stress, we recommend establishing early-warning systems (EWS) and last-mile alerts in the Andean highlands. This will enable communities to prepare for and respond to climate-related disasters, such as floods and droughts. Specifically, we advocate for:

* Investing $[VERIFY] million in the development of an EWS that integrates satellite imaging, weather forecasting, and community-based monitoring.
* Collaborating with local governments and NGOs to establish a last-mile alert system that reaches 80% of households within 24 hours of a disaster warning.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to [NEEDS SOURCE] people, with only 32.4% accessing safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data] and 53.3% having access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Climate change intensifies these challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and floods. Without robust interventions, Sub-Saharan Africa risks falling further behind in achieving SDG 6 (clean water) and related climate goals.

## Analysis
- **Water Security**: Despite a global trend of increasing access to safe drinking water at [NEEDS SOURCE]%, Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind with only 32.4%. Droughts and limited infrastructure exacerbate this disparity, impacting public health and economic productivity.
- **Clean Energy**: The region's renewable energy consumption stands at [NEEDS SOURCE]% of total final energy consumption globally [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to see the largest increase in electricity demand by 2050, underscoring a need for accelerated clean energy adoption and infrastructure development.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts are evident with an increasing number of climate-related disasters. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa experiences more than [NEEDS SOURCE] million flood events annually [Source: UN-Water/WHO]. Building resilient water supply systems is crucial to mitigate these effects.

## Policy Recommendations
1. **Establish Early-Warning Systems (EWS)**:
	* Invest $[VERIFY] million in the development of an EWS that integrates satellite imaging, weather forecasting, and community-based monitoring.
	* Collaborate with local governments and NGOs to ensure EWS reaches 80% of households within 24 hours of a disaster warning.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**:
	* Implement feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and community solar projects to accelerate renewable energy deployment.
	* Collaborate with international partners like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to fund large-scale projects.
3. **Climate Resilience Initiatives**:
	* Develop last-mile alert systems for climate-related disasters and invest in resilient water infrastructure such as flood barriers and reservoirs.

## Implementation Considerations
Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning, stakeholder engagement, and adequate funding. Public-private partnerships can leverage resources efficiently. Monitoring and evaluation frameworks should be established to track progress and address implementation challenges.

## Conclusion
Addressing water security, promoting clean energy, and enhancing climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is essential for sustainable development. By adopting these evidence-based recommendations, decision-makers can create a more resilient future for the region's populations and economies.
