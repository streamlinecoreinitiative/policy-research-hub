**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary
To address water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts in lower-income countries, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. This approach will improve access to clean water, enhance renewable energy deployment, and support climate adaptation measures. We estimate that by investing $100 million over five years, these cooperatives can reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups.

## Context & Challenge
Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (73.7% globally) [1] and electricity (53.3%) [2]. The global population lacking safe water is 2.2 billion people [3], with Sub-Saharan Africa being the most affected region. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing drought frequency and intensity, threatening water security and food production.

## Analysis
The Sudano-Sahelian belt, spanning across West Africa, is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate-related disasters. The region's population relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture, making them susceptible to droughts and floods [4]. Current infrastructure and financial resources are insufficient to meet basic needs, highlighting the need for innovative solutions.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**:
	* Implement large-scale water filtration projects and provide subsidies for household water filters in rural areas where access is most limited.
	* Encourage investment in solar and wind power projects through grants, tax incentives, and off-grid electricity solutions.
	* Develop climate-resilient infrastructure projects such as flood barriers and drought-resistant crops.
2. **Increase Access to Clean Water**:
	* Implement large-scale water filtration projects and provide subsidies for household water filters in rural areas where access is most limited.
3. **Enhance Renewable Energy Deployment**:
	* Encourage investment in solar and wind power projects through grants, tax incentives, and off-grid electricity solutions.

## Implementation Considerations
Implementing these measures will require substantial investment in both capital and operational costs. Limited financial resources, lack of skilled personnel, and resistance from communities who may not see immediate benefits are potential barriers to implementation.

## Conclusion
Lower-income countries must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to build sustainable futures. Establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt is a crucial step towards achieving these goals. We recommend allocating dedicated funding streams and engaging communities in planning processes for successful implementation.

**Next Steps**: Develop a multi-year plan with clear timelines, allocate dedicated funding streams, and engage communities in planning processes for successful implementation.
