# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sahel: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Sahel: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. With [VERIFY] 53.3% of the population lacking access to electricity (World Bank, 2023) and less than a third having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), this region is particularly vulnerable to droughts and other climate-related stresses. To address these challenges, we recommend prioritizing solar-powered renewable energy projects in off-grid regions, implementing microgrid systems at rural health centers, and developing climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's high population density, limited resources, and weak institutional capacity make it highly vulnerable to environmental stresses. Climate change exacerbates water scarcity and energy poverty, leading to food insecurity and health risks (IPCC, 2022). The region is experiencing more frequent and severe droughts, further straining these resources (UNDP, 2022).

## Analysis

### Water Security

* Less than a quarter of the population has access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024), resulting in waterborne diseases.
* Freshwater withdrawal accounts for [VERIFY] 9.2% of global resources (World Bank Open Data, 2021).
* The global population lacking safe water is estimated at [NEEDS SOURCE] 2.2 billion people.

### Clean Energy

* Only about [VERIFY] 53% of the population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), with rural areas suffering disproportionately.
* Renewable energy consumption accounts for [VERIFY] 19.7% of global energy mix (World Bank Open Data, 2020).
* SDG 6 progress reports a [NEEDS SOURCE] 74% global coverage in safely managed water.

### Climate Adaptation

* Droughts and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, further straining these resources.
* The Sahel region is particularly vulnerable to climate-related stresses due to its high population density and limited resources.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Access**: Prioritize solar-powered renewable energy projects in off-grid regions to reduce reliance on fossil fuels (World Bank, 2023).
2. **Microgrids for Rural Clinics**: Implement microgrid systems at rural health centers to improve power supply and reliability (World Bank, 2024).
3. **Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Develop cooperatives that use climate-resilient irrigation techniques to sustain crop yields during droughts (UNDP, 2022).

## Implementation Considerations

* Secure funding through existing development programs and partnerships.
* Estimated costs for solar projects: [NEEDS SOURCE] $1.6 billion over the next five years.
* Limited technical expertise in renewable energy implementation may pose a challenge.

## Conclusion

Governments, NGOs, and international partners must collaborate on these interventions to enhance resilience and improve living standards in Sub-Saharan Africa. We urge governments to prioritize watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sahel region to safeguard freshwater ecosystems. Developing detailed project plans and seeking funding opportunities will accelerate implementation.
