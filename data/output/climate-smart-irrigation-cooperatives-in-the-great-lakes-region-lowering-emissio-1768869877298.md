# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Renewing Water Security, Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

To address Sub-Saharan Africa's critical water security challenges, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region. These cooperatives will not only enhance water security but also promote clean energy adoption and improve climate resilience. By 2024, [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population had access to safely managed drinking water, while just [VERIFY] 53.3% accessed electricity [1]. This brief presents evidence-based recommendations to improve water security, promote clean energy use, and enhance climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with severe water scarcity and limited access to modern energy sources, exacerbating the effects of climate change. The region's vulnerability to droughts and floods underscores the need for robust interventions in water security, clean energy adoption, and climate adaptation [2]. Recent data highlights the urgency of this challenge:

* Access to safely managed drinking water: 32.4% (2024) [1]
* Access to electricity: 53.3% (2023) [1]

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from inadequate sanitation infrastructure, leading to poor hygiene practices and disease outbreaks. Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, while over 50 million lack any form of improved water source [3]. Inadequate water management contributes to:

* Freshwater withdrawal: [NEEDS SOURCE]

### Energy Access

The region's electricity access rate is only [VERIFY] 53.3%, with rural areas being disproportionately affected. This disparity contributes to health risks and economic stagnation.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts, such as droughts and floods, threaten food security and livelihoods. Integrating climate-resilient agriculture and drought-resistant crop varieties into national development plans can help mitigate these effects [5].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**
	* Collaborate with local communities to establish cooperatives that promote efficient water use and adopt clean energy sources (e.g., solar-powered irrigation systems).
	* Source: UN-Water/WHO
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**
	* Invest in solar-powered desalination plants to provide safe drinking water in coastal areas where freshwater is scarce but sunshine abundant.
	* Source: World Bank Open Data
3. **Enhance Water Infrastructure Investments**
	* Implement large-scale water storage projects in arid regions, supported by international grants and local financing mechanisms.
	* Source: UN-Water/WHO

## Implementation Considerations

* Initial investment in water infrastructure could cost [NEEDS SOURCE], with ongoing maintenance estimated at $50 million annually [6].
* Renewable energy projects would require an upfront investment of [NEEDS SOURCE] to set up solar-powered desalination plants [7].

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for sustainable development. By implementing the recommended policies, governments can significantly improve living standards while reducing vulnerability to future shocks. Collaboration between international donors, national authorities, and local communities remains essential for successful implementation.
