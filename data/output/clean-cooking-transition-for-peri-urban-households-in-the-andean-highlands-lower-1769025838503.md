**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water, reliable electricity, and resilient infrastructure against climate change impacts. To address these issues, we recommend implementing cost-effective water security measures, expanding clean energy access, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

* Invest in micro-insurance for smallholder farmers to mitigate drought risk [NEEDS SOURCE].
* Promote cost-effective technologies like drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting ponds.
* Implement community-based solar power plants to provide electricity in remote areas.
* Support microgrids for rural clinics, ensuring reliable and sustainable electricity supply (World Bank data, 2024).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe water crisis with only [VERIFY] % of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). Similarly, electricity access is at just [VERIFY] % in this region (World Bank Open Data, 2023). These issues exacerbate poverty, health risks, and hinder economic development. Climate change further compounds these challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.

## Analysis

The World Bank's data reveals a stark contrast between access to safe water (73.7% globally) versus Sub-Saharan Africa’s [VERIFY] %, indicating significant disparities (World Bank Open Data). Access to electricity is also limited, with only half of the region’s population having reliable access (53.3%), compared to global figures (91.6%) (World Bank Open Data, 2023). Renewable energy consumption remains low at [VERIFY] %, far below global trends (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

Climate change impacts threaten water security and agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Increased frequency of extreme weather events like droughts and floods pose risks to freshwater resources and coastal infrastructure, further complicating access to safe drinking water.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Integrate climate-resilient water management practices**:
	* Invest in micro-insurance for smallholder farmers to mitigate drought risk [NEEDS SOURCE].
	* Promote cost-effective technologies like drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting ponds.
2. **Expand clean energy access through off-grid solar solutions**:
	* Implement community-based solar power plants to provide electricity in remote areas.
	* Support microgrids for rural clinics, ensuring reliable and sustainable electricity supply (World Bank data, 2024).
3. **Enhance climate adaptation strategies**:
	* Invest in mangrove restoration projects for coastal protection and carbon sequestration [NEEDS SOURCE].
	* Develop nature-based solutions like landslide risk reduction to safeguard freshwater ecosystems.

## Implementation Considerations

Practical steps include community engagement, capacity building for local authorities, and leveraging existing infrastructure. Potential barriers include high initial costs, technical challenges in off-grid solar deployment, and resistance from traditional energy providers. Address these by providing subsidies, offering training programs, and establishing partnerships with international organizations.

## Conclusion

Immediate policy interventions are necessary to improve water security, enhance clean energy access, and bolster climate adaptation efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa. We urge policymakers to prioritize these recommendations and support the transition towards a more resilient future for the region.
