# Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and ecologically sensitive regions worldwide, supporting a significant portion of global fisheries. Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity, increased disaster risks, and intensified poverty among vulnerable groups. This brief presents an integrated solution to address these challenges: solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.

## Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

Climate change has severe impacts on agriculture in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have reduced water availability for irrigation, affecting crop yields and food security.

*   **Water loss percentages:** [Verify] 30% evaporation and 5% seepage losses are reported.
*   Existing irrigation systems: boreholes and canals.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems are inefficient, with significant losses due to evaporation and seepage. This inefficiency exacerbates water scarcity, affecting agricultural productivity and food security.
