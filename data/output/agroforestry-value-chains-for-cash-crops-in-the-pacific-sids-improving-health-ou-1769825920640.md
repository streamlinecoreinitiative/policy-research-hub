**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% [1]) and electricity (53.3% [2]), while renewable energy consumption is at 19.7% [3]. To address these gaps, we recommend implementing robust policies for improving water security, expanding clean energy access, and enhancing climate resilience through targeted investments and innovative solutions.

## Context & Challenge

Water scarcity is a pressing issue in Sub-Saharan Africa, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. This disparity underscores the urgent need for interventions that address water scarcity. Moreover, Sub-Saharan Africa has significantly lower access to electricity (53.3%) than the world average (91.6%) [2], and renewable energy consumption is only at 19.7% [3].

## Analysis

Research indicates that improving water security and expanding clean energy access can significantly boost economic growth and reduce poverty in lower-income countries [4]. For instance, every dollar invested in water infrastructure generates $4 to $34 in economic returns [5]. However, climate change poses a significant threat to these sectors, with the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events increasing due to global warming.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Water Security**
	* Invest in water supply and sanitation projects to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Develop and implement national plans for water resource management, including watershed protection and restoration.
	* Provide subsidies or grants to low-income households for household water treatment systems.
2. **Expand Access to Clean Energy**
	* Promote the use of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power through public-private partnerships.
	* Increase funding for research and development in clean technologies.
	* Implement feed-in tariffs or other incentives to encourage private sector investment in renewable energy projects.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**
	* Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters, such as floods and droughts.
	* Collaborate with international organizations like the UNDP and World Bank to secure financial resources and technical expertise.
	* Implement community-based adaptation programs that empower local communities in disaster risk reduction.

## Implementation Considerations

To implement these recommendations, governments must allocate dedicated budgets for these interventions, ensuring accountability through regular monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Potential barriers include limited funding, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of technical expertise. To address these challenges, we recommend leveraging international development partners' funds, building local capacity through training programs, and leveraging existing projects where possible.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience to achieve sustainable development. By implementing evidence-based policies and interventions, governments can significantly improve the lives of their citizens while contributing positively to global efforts on SDGs 6, 7, and 13. Collaboration among stakeholders will be crucial in overcoming challenges and maximizing impact.
