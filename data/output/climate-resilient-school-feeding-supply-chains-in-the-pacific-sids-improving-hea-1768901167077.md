**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Pacific SIDS: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to enhance environmental resilience, specifically water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, in lower-income countries. The global percentage of people with safe drinking water access stands at 73.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2024), while in Sub-Saharan Africa it drops to 32.4% (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Access to electricity hovers around 53.3% in the region (World Bank, 2023), and renewable energy consumption is only 19.7% (World Bank, 2020). To bridge these gaps, we recommend investing in water infrastructure projects, promoting clean energy solutions, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies tailored for lower-income countries.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries are disproportionately affected by environmental challenges like water scarcity, limited access to electricity, and inadequate renewable energy consumption. These issues not only hinder economic development but also exacerbate health risks. The United Nations SDG 6 aims for universal access to safe drinking water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), yet progress remains slow in Sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, the world is far from achieving the goal of 100% electricity access by 2030.

## Analysis

### Water Security

According to World Bank data, only 53.3% of people in Sub-Saharan Africa have access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). This is significantly lower than the global average and affects water infrastructure maintenance. Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of resources worldwide (World Bank Open Data, 2021), with significant variations across regions.

### Clean Energy Access

Renewable energy consumption remains low at 19.7%, with much higher percentages seen globally (World Bank, 2020). The global population lacking safe water stands at [VERIFY] 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

### Climate Adaptation

Sub-Saharan Africa's climate resilience efforts are underdeveloped compared to other regions, as evidenced by the SDG 6 progress report indicating only 74% global coverage (UN SDG Report, 2023). Early warning systems and drought-resistant crop varieties can mitigate the impact of climate change on water resources.

## Policy Recommendations

### Water Security:

1. **Invest in building and maintaining water infrastructure projects**: Allocate funds for wells and pipelines to ensure reliable access.
2. **Implement subsidies or grants for households**: Support low-cost filtration system installations to improve drinking water quality.
3. **Promote rainwater harvesting initiatives**: Supplement existing water sources with rainwater collection systems.

### Clean Energy Access:

1. **Encourage solar-powered microgrids deployment**: Invest in rural areas where grid extension is not feasible.
2. **Provide incentives for clean energy solutions**: Support innovative projects, such as solar cold-chain systems for fisheries (Andean highlands example).
3. **Invest in renewable energy projects**: Focus on off-grid regions to increase access.

### Climate Adaptation:

1. **Develop early warning systems**: Enhance community preparedness against climate-related water scarcity.
2. **Implement drought-resistant crop varieties**: Promote sustainable agricultural practices to reduce vulnerability.
3. **Enhance community resilience through education programs**: Teach adaptation strategies and promote behavioral change.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in infrastructure projects can be substantial, but long-term benefits include improved health outcomes, economic growth, and reduced vulnerability to climate shocks. Addressing potential barriers such as political resistance, lack of funding, and technical expertise requires coordinated efforts between governments, international organizations, NGOs, and local communities.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience to ensure sustainable development and improved quality of life for their citizens. By taking targeted actions now, decision-makers can make a significant impact in enhancing environmental resilience across Sub-Saharan Africa.
