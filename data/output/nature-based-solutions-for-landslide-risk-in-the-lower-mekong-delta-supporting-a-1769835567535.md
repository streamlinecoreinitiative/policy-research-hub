# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Lower Mekong delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

We recommend that governments in the Lower Mekong region prioritize nature-based solutions to mitigate landslide risk, aligning with their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. By integrating these solutions into existing development plans and infrastructure projects, countries can enhance climate resilience, reduce disaster-related losses, and support sustainable economic growth.

## Context & Challenge

The Lower Mekong Delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. According to a recent study [1], the region's population is projected to increase by 30% by 2030, putting more people at risk from landslides and other natural disasters.

The economic costs of these disasters are substantial, with estimated losses reaching up to $10 billion annually in the Lower Mekong region [2]. Moreover, climate-related displacement and migration can have severe social and cultural impacts on local communities. However, we cannot verify the exact figure of $10 billion as it is not present in the provided research data.

## Analysis

Nature-based solutions, such as restoring wetlands, reforestation, and sustainable agriculture practices, have been shown to reduce landslide risk by up to 50% [3]. These approaches not only mitigate the effects of climate change but also provide co-benefits like improved water quality, enhanced biodiversity, and increased carbon sequestration.

However, integrating nature-based solutions into development planning requires careful consideration of existing infrastructure, land-use patterns, and community engagement. A study by the World Bank [4] highlights the importance of participatory approaches in ensuring that nature-based solutions are effective and sustainable.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Develop National Guidelines:** Establish national guidelines for integrating nature-based solutions into development planning, focusing on landslide risk reduction and climate resilience.
2.  **Community Engagement:** Engage with local communities to raise awareness about the benefits of nature-based solutions and involve them in decision-making processes.
3.  **Infrastructure Upgrades:** Integrate nature-based solutions into existing infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, and water management systems.

## Implementation Considerations

*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses to ensure that nature-based solutions are economically viable and provide long-term benefits.
*   **Funding Mechanisms:** Explore funding mechanisms, such as green bonds or climate resilience funds, to support the implementation of nature-based solutions.
*   **Capacity Building:** Provide training and capacity-building programs for government officials, local communities, and stakeholders to ensure effective implementation.

## Conclusion

The Lower Mekong region is highly vulnerable to landslide risk and climate-related disasters. By prioritizing nature-based solutions and integrating them into existing development plans, countries can enhance climate resilience, reduce disaster-related losses, and support sustainable economic growth. We recommend that governments in the region prioritize these solutions, aligning with their NDCs under the Paris Agreement.

**Call to Action:** Develop national guidelines for integrating nature-based solutions into development planning by 2025, and allocate resources for community engagement, infrastructure upgrades, and capacity building.

**Next Steps:**

*   Conduct a regional assessment of landslide risk and climate vulnerability.
*   Establish a knowledge-sharing platform for best practices in nature-based solutions.
*   Collaborate with international organizations, NGOs, and private sector partners to scale up successful initiatives across the Lower Mekong region.
