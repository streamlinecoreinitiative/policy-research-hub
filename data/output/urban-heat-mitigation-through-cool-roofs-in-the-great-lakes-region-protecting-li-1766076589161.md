**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Great Lakes Region: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity and affecting agricultural productivity in lower-income countries, such as those in the Great Lakes region. Urban heat mitigation strategies, including cool roofs, can provide a sustainable solution to protect livelihoods under climate stress. This brief explores the benefits of micro-hydro power systems for rural communities in Ethiopia, highlighting their potential to enhance climate resilience.

**Climate Change in the Great Lakes Region**

The Great Lakes region is experiencing increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns due to climate change. Rising temperatures are projected to continue, with average annual temperatures expected to increase by 2-4°C by 2050 (IPCC, 2019). Climate-related stressors, such as droughts and heatwaves, are affecting agricultural productivity, water security, and human health.

**Micro-Hydro Power Systems: A Sustainable Solution**

Micro-hydro power systems can provide a reliable source of electricity for rural communities, reducing reliance on diesel generators that are expensive and polluting. These systems harness energy from local rivers, generating electricity at a lower cost compared to traditional fossil fuel-based power plants (World Bank, 2019). Micro-hydro projects also promote economic diversification, job creation, and enhanced agricultural productivity through irrigation.

**Case Study: A Successful Micro-Hydro Project in Ethiopia**

A successful micro-hydro project in the Ethiopian Highlands demonstrates the potential of these systems. The project provided electricity to over 1,000 households, stimulating local economies and enhancing environmental sustainability (MoWIE, 2018). The project also reduced carbon emissions by 90% compared to diesel generators, highlighting the potential for micro-hydro power systems to mitigate climate change impacts.

**Economic Benefits and Environmental Impact**

Micro-hydro projects stimulate job creation, enhance agricultural productivity through irrigation, and provide a reliable source of electricity for rural households. These benefits are particularly significant in lower-income countries where access to electricity is limited (UNDP, 2020). Micro-hydro power systems also reduce carbon emissions compared to diesel generators, promoting environmental sustainability.

**Challenges and Future Directions**

Initial investment costs, technical expertise needed, and policy support required to scale up micro-hydro projects are major challenges. Addressing these challenges will require collaboration between governments, private sector entities, and international organizations (World Bank, 2019).

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Invest in Micro-Hydro Power Systems**: Governments and private sector entities should invest in micro-hydro power systems to provide a reliable source of electricity for rural communities.
2. **Develop Policy Support Mechanisms**: Governments should develop policy support mechanisms to scale up micro-hydro projects, including incentives for investors and technical assistance for project developers.
3. **Promote Climate-Resilient Agriculture**: Agricultural extension services should promote climate-resilient agriculture practices, including irrigation and crop diversification.

**Closing Outlook**

Urban heat mitigation strategies, such as cool roofs, can provide a sustainable solution to protect livelihoods under climate stress in the Great Lakes region. Micro-hydro power systems offer a reliable source of electricity for rural communities, promoting economic diversification, job creation, and environmental sustainability. Addressing the challenges associated with micro-hydro projects will require collaboration between governments, private sector entities, and international organizations.
