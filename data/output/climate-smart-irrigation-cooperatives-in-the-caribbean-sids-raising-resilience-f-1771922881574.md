# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Caribbean SIDS: raising resilience finance for communities

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in Caribbean SIDS: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water, reliable electricity, and resilient infrastructure against climate change impacts. To address these interlinked issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in microgrids for remote areas, promoting solar-powered water pumps, expanding access to clean energy, and implementing nature-based solutions for water security.

Key findings:

* Sub-Saharan Africa has limited access to clean water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), with only 19.7% of final energy consumption coming from renewable sources.
	+ [VERIFY] This claim is not supported by the provided research data, which indicates a higher global coverage for safely managed drinking water (73.7%) and access to electricity (91.6%). The actual numbers for Sub-Saharan Africa are: access to safely managed drinking water (%) - 32.4 [Source: World Bank Open Data], and access to electricity (%) - 53.3 [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* These gaps are exacerbated by climate change, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.

Recommendations:

1. **Microgrids for Remote Areas**: Implement microgrids to provide reliable electricity to remote communities. Solar-powered mini-grids can reduce reliance on diesel generators and improve energy access.

2. **Solar-Powered Water Pumps**: Deploy solar-powered water pumps to increase access to clean drinking water. This technology is cost-effective and sustainable compared to traditional borehole wells.

3. **Renewable Energy Expansion**: Invest in renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines to increase the share of clean power. This will improve overall energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Limited access to safe drinking water affects over [NEEDS SOURCE] people, while only about 50% have reliable electricity. These challenges threaten public health and economic stability, particularly in already marginalized communities.

Why it matters now:

* Climate change has intensified droughts and floods, further straining existing infrastructure.
* The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects a [NEEDS SOURCE] reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa's water resources by 2050.

## Analysis

Access to clean water is crucial for preventing diseases like cholera and dysentery (2.2 billion people lacking safe water). Inadequate electricity access hinders economic growth and exacerbates health risks during heatwaves.

Climate change has significant impacts on water resources, including:

* Freshwater withdrawal (% of resources) - World (2021): 9.2 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
* Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024): 32.4 [Source: World Bank Open Data]

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Microgrids for Remote Areas**: Implement microgrids to provide reliable electricity to remote communities.

3. **Renewable Energy Expansion**: Invest in renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines.

## Implementation Considerations

Pilot projects should be initiated first to demonstrate the viability of these solutions. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities is essential for successful implementation.

Costs:

* Initial investments are significant but can be offset by cost savings from reduced energy bills and improved health outcomes.
* Long-term benefits include economic growth and increased resilience against climate shocks.

Potential barriers:

* Political resistance to change
* Lack of funding
* Technical challenges (e.g., grid integration)

## Conclusion

By focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we can significantly improve the lives of millions. It is imperative that policymakers take decisive action now to build a more resilient future for all.
