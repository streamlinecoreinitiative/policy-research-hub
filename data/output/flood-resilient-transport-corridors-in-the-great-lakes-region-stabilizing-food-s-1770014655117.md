# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Great Lakes region: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan African countries face significant challenges in ensuring water security, promoting clean energy adoption, and building climate resilience. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing equitable access to water supply and sanitation, accelerating renewable energy deployment, and enhancing early warning systems for climate risks.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Over 30% of the population lacks safe drinking water [NEEDS SOURCE], while less than half have access to electricity [NEEDS SOURCE]. The continent's freshwater resources are under strain, with only [VERIFY] % withdrawn sustainably.

### Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption stands at just [VERIFY]% far below global averages. This shortfall impacts sustainable development efforts. Economic constraints limit investment in infrastructure; inadequate governance structures hinder equitable access to resources and services. Investing in climate-resilient water management practices, such as rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment systems, can improve both water security and energy efficiency.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
	* Implement universal piped water connections within the next decade.
	* Provide subsidies for improved sanitation facilities like toilets and septic tanks.
2. **Renewable Energy Deployment**:
	* Increase public sector investment in renewable energy projects by [VERIFY] billion annually.
	* Encourage private sector partnerships through tax incentives and regulatory reforms.
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**:
	* Establish early warning systems to predict droughts, floods, and other climate-related events.
	* Promote agroforestry practices that integrate trees into farming systems for soil conservation and carbon sequestration.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require an estimated [VERIFY] billion annually to cover infrastructure development and technology transfer. High initial costs, lack of skilled labor, and limited access to financing mechanisms such as green bonds or concessional loans are significant barriers. To mitigate these challenges, we recommend leveraging international funding through partnerships with organizations like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for cost-sharing projects.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy, and climate resilience to achieve SDG 6 (water), SDG 7 (energy), and SDG 13 (climate action). Immediate policy actions are necessary to address current gaps and promote sustainable development pathways for the region. By implementing these recommendations, we can ensure a more resilient future for Sub-Saharan Africa's communities.

- **Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024)**: 32.4 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
- **Renewable energy consumption (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2021)**: 17% [Source: World Bank Open Data]
- **Global population lacking safe water (2022)**: Over 650 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa [Source: UN-Water/WHO]

### Additional Evidence Needed

- Detailed breakdown of climate adaptation projects implemented by governments and international organizations.
- Success stories or case studies illustrating successful early warning system deployment in Sub-Saharan African countries.

Changes made:

1. Flagged numbers not present in the research data as "[VERIFY]".
2. Added source citations where missing (e.g., [NEEDS SOURCE] for population lacking safe water).
3. Removed clearly fabricated statistics (e.g., $10 billion annually for infrastructure development and technology transfer).
4. Preserved the Policy Brief format and title.

Note: The provided research data does not support some of the claims made in the original document, such as the 30% of the population lacking safe drinking water or the estimated $10 billion annual cost for implementing recommendations. These numbers should be verified through additional sources to ensure accuracy.
