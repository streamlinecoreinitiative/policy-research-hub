# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, particularly in lower-income countries where school feeding programs play a crucial role in supporting vulnerable populations. The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, with frequent droughts and floods affecting agricultural productivity.

## Climate-Resilient Water Supply Chains

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, affecting agricultural productivity and food security. Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation due to rising temperatures have led to reduced crop yields, decreased livestock productivity, and increased poverty.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the region rely heavily on boreholes and canals, which often result in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage. These inefficiencies exacerbate water scarcity, further straining agricultural production and food security.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion and improving water retention. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry systems in enhancing water availability for irrigation (e.g., [Case Study 1], [Case Study 2]).

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a cost-effective solution to reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency. By harnessing small-scale hydroelectric power, communities can generate renewable energy while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the successful integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to enhance water supply resilience. Economic analyses indicate that these integrated solutions are cost-effective, with potential for scaling up to support climate adaptation targets.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Support Adoption at Scale:** Provide subsidies, low-interest loans, and infrastructure development to encourage the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Capacity Building:** Offer training programs for farmers, technicians, and policymakers to enhance their understanding of these technologies and promote their effective implementation.
3.  **Data Collection and Monitoring:** Establish a monitoring system to track the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects in enhancing water security and supporting climate adaptation targets.

## Future Research Directions

1.  **Long-term Sustainability Assessments:** Conduct studies to evaluate the long-term sustainability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Community Engagement Strategies:** Develop strategies for engaging local communities in the planning, implementation, and maintenance of these projects.

## Actions/Recommendations List

*   Support policy makers in developing NDCs that incorporate climate-resilient water supply chains
*   Provide funding for pilot projects integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems
*   Establish partnerships with international organizations to share knowledge and best practices on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro solutions

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into school feeding supply chains offers a promising solution to enhance water security, promote clean energy, and support climate adaptation targets in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By leveraging these technologies, countries can improve irrigation efficiency, reduce reliance on diesel generators, and increase access to renewable energy.
