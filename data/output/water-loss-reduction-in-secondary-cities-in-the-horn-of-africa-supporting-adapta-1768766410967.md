Here's the revised brief:

# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa faces severe water scarcity and poverty challenges, exacerbated by climate change impacts, population growth, and unsustainable agricultural practices. This brief presents an integrated solution to address these issues through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in secondary cities.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Horn of Africa

The region is characterized by limited water resources, with average annual rainfall ranging from 200-400 mm [verify]. Climate change projections indicate a decrease in rainfall and increased frequency of droughts, exacerbating existing water scarcity issues. Population growth and unsustainable agricultural practices have further strained water resources.

## Current Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems are often inefficient, using more water than necessary due to outdated technology and poor maintenance. High operational costs and limited access to electricity for micro-hydro systems hinder the adoption of renewable energy sources. Socio-economic factors such as poverty, lack of education, and limited institutional capacity contribute to water scarcity in the region.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems

Agroforestry practices can enhance soil fertility, improve water retention, and increase crop yields while reducing water consumption [verify]. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems provides a sustainable water management solution, enhancing overall system efficiency and resilience to climate change. Case studies from the Mesoamerican Highlands demonstrate successful implementation of agroforestry-based micro-hydro projects.

## Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated approaches combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can contribute to climate resilience by:

• Drought-resistant crops
• Improved water management practices
• Enhanced soil fertility through agroforestry practices

Case studies from the Mesoamerican Highlands showcase successful implementation of climate-resilient irrigation systems. Future research directions and policy recommendations for scaling up these solutions include:

* Government policies supporting the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems
* Research on system design, cost-effectiveness, and impact
* Collaboration between stakeholders to implement these solutions on a larger scale

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Develop and implement government policies** that support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Conduct further research** on system design, cost-effectiveness, and impact to improve overall efficiency and effectiveness.
3. **Establish collaborations** between stakeholders (governments, NGOs, private sector) to scale up these solutions.

## Closing Outlook

Addressing water scarcity in secondary cities in the Horn of Africa requires an integrated approach that combines agroforestry and micro-hydro systems. By leveraging these technologies, we can reduce water loss, enhance resilience to climate change, and ensure sustainable economic benefits for local communities.

I made the following changes:

* Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
* Removed speculative claims that are not evidence-backed, such as "up to 80% more water than necessary".
* Kept length similar and preserved headings.
* Replaced generic title with a specific one consistent with the outline.
