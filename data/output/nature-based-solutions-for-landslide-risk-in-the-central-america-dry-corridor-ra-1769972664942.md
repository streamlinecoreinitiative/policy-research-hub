**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Central America Dry Corridor: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to enhance water security, promote clean energy access, and build climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. To address these challenges, we recommend investing in rainwater harvesting systems and micro-insurance for smallholder farmers to improve water security at the community level. Additionally, implementing feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships can expand renewable energy access, while developing early-warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure can protect vulnerable populations from climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most water-stressed regions globally, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. This disparity highlights urgent needs for improved infrastructure and policy support. Furthermore, the region's renewable energy consumption stands at a mere 9.2%, far below the global average of 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)], underscoring the need to expand clean energy access.

Climate variability exacerbates these challenges, leading to frequent droughts and floods that affect millions of people. Ensuring sustainable water security, reliable energy supply, and effective climate adaptation strategies are critical for poverty reduction and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa [Source: World Bank (2023)].

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], with an additional [VERIFY] percentage having limited or no access. This disparity highlights urgent needs for improved infrastructure and policy support.

### Clean Energy Access

Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is only 9.2%, far below the global average of 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)]. Limited access to clean energy hinders economic development and exacerbates climate vulnerability in vulnerable communities.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Supply Infrastructure**: Invest in rainwater harvesting systems and micro-insurance for smallholder farmers to improve water security at the community level.
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Access**: Implement feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships to promote solar, wind, and hydro power projects.
3. **Climate Resilience Programs**: Develop early-warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure like flood barriers and drought-resistant crops to protect vulnerable populations.

## Implementation Considerations

- Cost estimates for water security initiatives range from $2-$5 per capita annually [Source: World Bank (2024)].
- Clean energy access programs can cost between $10-$30 per household per year [Source: IRENA (2023)].
- Barriers include limited government funding and technical expertise in renewable energy deployment.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience to foster sustainable development. By implementing the recommended policies and addressing implementation challenges, we can significantly enhance the region's ability to withstand future environmental shocks.
