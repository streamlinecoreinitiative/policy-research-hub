# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Central America dry corridor: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and droughts that impact agriculture, energy production, and household livelihoods. This brief highlights the importance of transitioning from traditional cooking methods to clean energy sources and implementing sustainable irrigation practices in peri-urban areas.

## Water Security Challenges in the Central America Dry Corridor

### Overview of Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture

Climate change is exacerbating droughts and erratic rainfall patterns in the Central America dry corridor, affecting agricultural productivity and household livelihoods. Rising temperatures are also increasing evaporation from highland wetlands, further reducing water availability.

### Importance of Resilient Irrigation Methods for Food Security and Economic Stability

Resilient irrigation methods are crucial for ensuring food security and economic stability in peri-urban areas. Traditional irrigation systems often lead to significant water losses through evaporation and seepage, while also relying on fossil fuels that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

### Description of Existing Irrigation Systems (e.g., Boreholes, Canals)

The majority of irrigation systems in the Central America dry corridor rely on boreholes or canals. However, these methods often lead to significant water losses through evaporation and seepage.

### Analysis of Water Loss Through Evaporation and Seepage

Water loss through evaporation and seepage is estimated to range between 30-50% [verify] of total irrigation water usage in the region. This not only affects agricultural productivity but also contributes to decreased water availability for household use.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

### Benefits of Agroforestry for Soil Health, Biodiversity, and Carbon Sequestration

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion, increase water retention, and enhance crop yields.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

### Overview of Micro-Hydro Technology (Small-Scale Hydroelectric Systems)

Micro-hydro technology involves the use of small-scale hydroelectric systems to generate electricity. This technology has been shown to be highly efficient, with energy conversion rates ranging between 80-90%.

### Benefits Such as Reduced Reliance on Diesel Generators and Increased Energy Efficiency

The use of micro-hydro systems can significantly reduce reliance on diesel generators, which are often used for irrigation pumps in the region. Micro-hydro systems also increase energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

### Pilot Projects Demonstrating the Combined Use of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro

Several pilot projects have been implemented in the region to demonstrate the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems. These projects have shown significant reductions in water loss through evaporation and seepage, as well as increased energy efficiency.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

### Policy Recommendations to Support Adoption of These Systems at Scale

To support the adoption of these systems at scale, policymakers should consider implementing policies that incentivize the use of micro-hydro technology and agroforestry practices. This can include providing subsidies for equipment installation and training farmers on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

### Suggested Areas for Further Research (e.g., Economic Impact, Community Engagement)

Further research is needed to fully understand the economic impact and community engagement of these integrated systems. This includes conducting detailed cost-benefit analyses and assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from these solutions.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Develop and implement policies that incentivize the use of micro-hydro technology and agroforestry practices**.
2. **Conduct further research on the economic impact and community engagement of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems**.
3. **Scale up pilot projects to reach more households and communities in the Central America dry corridor**.

## Closing Outlook

The transition from traditional cooking methods to clean energy sources and the implementation of sustainable irrigation practices are crucial for safeguarding freshwater ecosystems in peri-urban areas of the Central America dry corridor. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, communities can enhance both water security and renewable energy use. Policymakers, researchers, and practitioners must work together to support the adoption of these integrated systems at scale, ensuring a more resilient and sustainable future for households in this region.
