**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Central America Dry Corridor: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by frequent droughts and water scarcity. This brief proposes an integrated approach combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to address water scarcity and poverty in the region.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor**

The Central America dry corridor spans across six countries, including Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity through increased evaporation rates and reduced rainfall patterns. The impacts of droughts on agriculture are severe, resulting in crop failures and economic losses for small-scale farmers.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Central America dry corridor include boreholes, canals, and rainwater harvesting systems. However, these methods often suffer from high water loss percentages due to evaporation and seepage. The exact percentage of water loss is unclear [verify].

**Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been recognized as a climate-resilient practice that improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Studies have demonstrated the potential for agroforestry systems to retain more water than traditional farming practices, but specific retention rates are not provided [verify].

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology involves the use of small-scale hydroelectric systems to generate electricity from water flow. This approach reduces reliance on diesel generators and decreases greenhouse gas emissions. However, the exact percentage improvement in irrigation efficiency is unclear [verify].

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems in improving water supply and reducing poverty. These integrated solutions can increase crop yields, improve food security, and generate income for small-scale farmers.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Policy Support:** Governments should develop policies to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale.
2. **Capacity Building:** Training programs should be established to build the capacity of farmers, extension agents, and policymakers in implementing these integrated solutions.
3. **Financing Mechanisms:** Financial mechanisms should be developed to provide affordable access to micro-hydro technology and agroforestry practices for small-scale farmers.

**Closing Outlook**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, with frequent droughts and water scarcity posing significant threats to food security and economic stability. The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to address these challenges. By adopting this approach, governments, policymakers, and stakeholders can reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups.

**Needed Evidence:**

1. **Climate Data:** Verification of rainfall patterns over the past decade in specific regions within the Central America dry corridor.
2. **Economic Analysis:** Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects in the region.
3. **Socioeconomic Studies:** Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.

**Rationale Summary:**

This proposal focuses on integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to water scarcity and poverty, ensuring economic benefits and sustainability. Key data points will validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these solutions, informed by existing research and best practices from similar regions.
