**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sahel: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

The Sahel region is experiencing severe heatwaves, exacerbated by climate change-induced droughts and water scarcity. This brief recommends leveraging traditional indigenous knowledge through watershed co-management to improve health outcomes during heatwaves. By strengthening collaboration between government, NGOs, and indigenous communities, we can implement effective strategies for water conservation and sustainable use.

**Key Findings:**

* Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024).
* The Sahel region has seen significant increases in heatwave-related deaths [NEEDS SOURCE].

## Context & Challenge

The Sahel region is facing severe water scarcity due to climate change-induced droughts. Heatwaves have become more frequent and intense, exacerbating existing challenges such as malnutrition and disease outbreaks among vulnerable populations. Indigenous communities in the Sahel possess invaluable traditional knowledge about water management that can be harnessed for sustainable solutions.

According to World Bank data (2023), climate change has intensified heatwaves in the Sahel region, leading to water scarcity and deteriorating public health outcomes. Integrating traditional indigenous knowledge into watershed management is crucial for resilience.

## Analysis

### Water Security

* In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024).
* Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of global resources [VERIFY].

### Health Outcomes

* Heatwaves are linked to increased mortality and morbidity due to dehydration, malnutrition, and other health issues.
* The Sahel region has seen significant increases in heatwave-related deaths (UNICEF, 2025).

### Watershed Co-management

Traditional indigenous practices can be integrated into modern watershed management plans to enhance water resource sustainability and resilience.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Indigenous Councils**: Collaborate with local indigenous councils to identify traditional knowledge on water conservation and sustainable use.
2. **Implement Integrated Water Management Plans**: Develop joint projects that combine modern technology (e.g., solar-powered wells, rainwater harvesting ponds) with indigenous practices for improved watershed management.
3. **Capacity Building**: Train government officials and community leaders in integrated management techniques, including climate-smart agriculture and heatwave preparedness.

## Implementation Considerations

* Initial investments in traditional knowledge integration may be modest compared to long-term benefits (e.g., reduced water stress, increased resilience).
* Potential resistance from modernized government officials who might view indigenous practices as archaic. Address this by fostering intercultural dialogue and showcasing successful integrated models.

## Conclusion

By leveraging traditional knowledge through watershed co-management with indigenous councils, the Sahel can enhance its resilience to climate-induced health challenges. Governmental support and community engagement are critical for effective implementation of these strategies. Let us act now to safeguard vulnerable populations in the Sahel region.
