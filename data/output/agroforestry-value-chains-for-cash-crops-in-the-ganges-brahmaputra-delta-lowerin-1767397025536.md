# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Resilience and Sustainability**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces significant environmental challenges due to climate change, including rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and increased water scarcity. This brief outlines a comprehensive approach to address these challenges by integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.

**I. Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

Climate change is impacting agriculture in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, reducing water availability for crops and exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers. The region's traditional irrigation systems are inefficient and costly.

**II. Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

* **Traditional Irrigation Systems:** Existing infrastructure includes boreholes and canals, which suffer from high water losses through evaporation and seepage.
* **Economic Costs:** Labor, maintenance, and fuel costs associated with traditional irrigation methods are significant economic burdens on smallholder farmers.

**III. Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, increase water retention capacity, and enhance biodiversity. Successful agroforestry projects have demonstrated improved water retention and reduced erosion.
* **Soil Health Benefits:** Improved soil structure and water retention due to vegetation cover.
* **Biodiversity Enhancement:** Increased biodiversity provides natural pest control and pollination services.

**IV. Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology can provide renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators and lowering emissions.
* **Overview of Micro-Hydro Technology:** Explain the concept and benefits of micro-hydro systems in providing renewable energy.
* **Energy Savings:** Examples of successful micro-hydro projects that have enhanced irrigation efficiency.

**V. Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems have demonstrated improved water security.
* **Integrated Systems Implementation:** Describe pilot projects where agroforestry and micro-hydro systems are integrated.
* **Economic Analysis:** Conduct a cost-benefit analysis showing the cost-effectiveness of these combined solutions.

**VI. Policy Recommendations**

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we recommend:
* **Subsidies and Grants:** Government subsidies or low-interest loans to support installation costs.
* **Infrastructure Development:** Funding for infrastructure improvements needed to facilitate implementation (e.g., roads, electricity grids).

**VII. Future Research Directions**

To ensure the long-term sustainability of these integrated systems, we suggest:
* **Long-term Sustainability Assessments:** Conduct baseline studies to monitor soil health, water retention, and community engagement over time.
* **Community Engagement Strategies:** Propose methods for engaging local communities in planning, implementation, and monitoring phases.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Develop a comprehensive policy framework supporting the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
2.  Provide funding for infrastructure development and subsidies for installation costs.
3.  Conduct long-term sustainability assessments to monitor the effectiveness of these integrated systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is at a critical juncture, facing unprecedented environmental challenges. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water security and promote sustainable agricultural practices. This brief provides a roadmap for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to work together towards a more resilient future for this critical region.
