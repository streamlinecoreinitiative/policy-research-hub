**Rainwater Harvesting Ponds as a Critical Adaptation Strategy for Drought-Prone Villages in East African Highlands**

Executive Summary:

The East African highlands face severe water scarcity exacerbated by climate change, posing significant challenges to rural communities' livelihoods and food security. Rainwater harvesting ponds offer a low-cost, locally accessible solution that can improve water security in these regions. This brief highlights the benefits of rainwater harvesting ponds, presents case studies from successful implementations, and provides policy recommendations for scaling up this adaptation strategy.

**Climate Challenges and Water Scarcity in East African Highlands**

The East African highlands are characterized by a semi-arid climate with limited rainfall, resulting in severe water scarcity. According to the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the region's average annual rainfall is significantly lower than the global average (FAO, 2020). Climate change further exacerbates these conditions, altering rainfall patterns and soil moisture levels (World Bank, 2019).

**Rainwater Harvesting Ponds: A Sustainable Water Management Solution**

Rainwater harvesting ponds are a sustainable water management tool that can collect and store rainwater for use during dry periods. The benefits of these ponds include:

• Reduced reliance on traditional water sources
• Improved crop yields due to consistent water supply
• Enhanced food security for rural communities
• Economic benefits through reduced transportation costs and increased agricultural productivity

**Case Studies and Success Stories**

Several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of rainwater harvesting ponds in East African highlands. For instance:

• In Kenya's Nyeri County, a community-led project implemented rainwater harvesting ponds, resulting in a 30% increase in maize yields (EAC, 2018)
• In Tanzania's Dodoma Region, a similar initiative improved water security for over 1,000 households, reducing reliance on distant water sources (FAO, 2020)

**Policy Recommendations and Next Steps**

To scale up rainwater harvesting ponds as an adaptation strategy:

• Governments should establish policies supporting the adoption of rainwater harvesting ponds, including incentives for community-led projects
• Collaboration between local communities, NGOs, and governments is essential in implementing these projects
• Data collection and monitoring are crucial to assess the long-term impact and effectiveness of rainwater harvesting ponds

Actions/Recommendations:

1. Establish a regional policy framework supporting rainwater harvesting ponds.
2. Provide training and capacity-building programs for community leaders and implementers.
3. Conduct comprehensive data collection and monitoring to assess project outcomes.

Closing Outlook:

Rainwater harvesting ponds offer a critical adaptation strategy for drought-prone villages in East African highlands. With the right policies, support, and collaboration, these low-cost, locally accessible solutions can improve water security, enhance food production, and ensure sustainable livelihoods for rural communities.
