# Bridging Water Security and Clean Energy Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa

**Bridging Water Security and Clean Energy Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to bridge the water security and clean energy gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water and nearly half have access to electricity [NEEDS SOURCE]. By investing $10 billion in public infrastructure for water supply systems and promoting renewable energy solutions such as solar-powered irrigation pumps, governments can significantly reduce vulnerability to climate-related crises.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions with the most significant challenges in terms of water security and energy access (electricity). With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data], there is a pressing need for interventions that improve this metric. Similarly, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in electricity access, with just 53.3% of the population being served by reliable power sources [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Both issues are exacerbated by climate change, leading to increased frequency and intensity of droughts and floods.

According to World Bank data, the global average for safely managed drinking water is 73.7%, while Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind at 32.4% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. The region also has a significant gap in electricity access, with only 53.3% of the population having access to reliable power sources compared to the world average of 91.6% [Source: World Bank Open Data].

### Analysis

The data underscores the severity of these challenges:

* **Access to safely managed drinking water**: Sub-Saharan Africa (32.4%) lags far behind the global average (73.7%) [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Electricity access**: Sub-Saharan Africa (53.3%) is below the world average (91.6%) [Source: World Bank Open Data].

These statistics highlight not only a lack of basic services but also potential vulnerabilities to climate impacts, such as drought and flooding.

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges effectively:

1. **Increase investment in public infrastructure**: Governments should prioritize the construction and maintenance of water supply systems (e.g., wells, boreholes) to ensure safe drinking water access.
2. **Promote renewable energy solutions**: Encourage the adoption of solar-powered irrigation pumps and microgrids for rural electrification. These technologies can reduce dependency on fossil fuels while improving energy security.
3. **Develop innovative financing mechanisms**: Utilize public-private partnerships (PPPs), grants, and concessional loans to finance water infrastructure projects and clean energy initiatives.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require strategic planning:

* **Costs**: Initial investments in infrastructure can be substantial but are offset by long-term savings from reduced health costs due to improved water quality.
* **Barriers**: Addressing climate change impacts (e.g., drought resistance) and ensuring equitable access (especially for rural areas).

### Conclusion

By investing in robust water security and clean energy solutions, Sub-Saharan African nations can enhance their resilience against climate shocks. This brief outlines actionable steps that governments and development partners can take to bridge the current gaps.

**Call to Action**: Develop a comprehensive strategy incorporating these recommendations to ensure sustainable progress towards achieving global water and energy targets by 2030.
