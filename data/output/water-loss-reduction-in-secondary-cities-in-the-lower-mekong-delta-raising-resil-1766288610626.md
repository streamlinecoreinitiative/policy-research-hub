# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Lower Mekong Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the world's most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and poverty. This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to address immediate water scarcity issues and contribute to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Delta

The Lower Mekong delta is characterized by:

* **Climate change impacts:** Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns leading to droughts and floods.
* **Water scarcity:** Limited access to clean water for agriculture, industry, and households.
* **Poverty:** High levels of poverty among rural communities, exacerbating the challenges.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Lower Mekong delta include:

* **Boreholes:** [Verify] water loss due to evaporation and seepage.
* **Canals:** [Verify] water loss due to seepage and leakage.

These inefficiencies exacerbate water scarcity, affecting food security and economic stability.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to:

* **Improve soil health:** Enhancing water retention and reducing erosion.
* **Increase biodiversity:** Supporting ecosystem services and resilience.
* **Sequester carbon:** Mitigating climate change impacts.

Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving water retention and reducing erosion, highlighting its potential for climate resilience.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers:

* **Reduced reliance on diesel generators:** Lowering energy costs and emissions.
* **Increased energy efficiency:** Maximizing water use while minimizing waste.

Pilot projects showcasing the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro demonstrate the potential for scaling up this integrated approach.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems:

* **Enhances water retention:** Reducing evaporation and seepage.
* **Increases energy efficiency:** Maximizing water use while minimizing waste.
* **Supports economic stability:** Ensuring food security and reducing poverty.

Economic analysis highlights the cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up this integrated approach.
