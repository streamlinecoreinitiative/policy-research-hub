# microgrids for rural clinics in the Andean highlands: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Andean Highlands: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), it is essential that governments and development partners invest in infrastructure projects that enhance clean water access and sanitation facilities. We recommend prioritizing renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and increase climate resilience. Furthermore, implementing early warning systems and improving data collection will enable better climate adaptation planning.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 60% of the world's freshwater resources (World Bank Open Data, 2021), yet struggles with access due to poor infrastructure and inadequate funding. The region faces significant challenges in meeting its SDG 6 targets related to water security and clean energy access. Climate change intensifies these challenges by increasing vulnerability to extreme weather events and altering precipitation patterns.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe water scarcity, with only [VERIFY] % of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) compared to a global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This disparity is exacerbated by inadequate sanitation facilities.

### Clean Energy Access

Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa remains low at [VERIFY] %, compared to the world's 19.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2020). Despite potential, current investments are insufficient to meet climate resilience goals.

### Climate Adaptation

The region is increasingly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, which threaten water security and energy access.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**:
	* Develop and finance projects that improve sanitation facilities and clean water access.
	* Implement rainwater harvesting ponds to supplement groundwater resources during dry periods.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**:
	* Invest in renewable energy infrastructure such as wind turbines and solar panels.
	* Establish policies that incentivize private sector investment in clean energy projects, including tax breaks and subsidies.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Planning**:
	* Develop early warning systems for climate-related hazards like droughts and floods to minimize loss of life and property.
	* Increase data collection on climate patterns and water resources to inform more effective adaptation strategies.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Funding**: Mobilize international aid, domestic budgets, and private sector investments through targeted grants and concessional loans.
2. **Capacity Building**: Train local communities and government officials in sustainable water management practices and renewable energy technologies.
3. **Regulatory Frameworks**: Establish clear regulatory frameworks to guide the deployment of new infrastructure projects.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa urgently needs targeted interventions to address its pressing challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. By implementing evidence-based policies and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, it is possible to create a more resilient future for millions of people living in poverty. We recommend prioritizing the development of microgrids for rural clinics in the Andean highlands as a critical step towards improving water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience.
