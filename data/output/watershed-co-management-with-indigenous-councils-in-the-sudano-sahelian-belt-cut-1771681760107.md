# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief advocates for watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a critical strategy to improve water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa. By investing in community-led initiatives, governments can reduce disaster losses, enhance resilience, and promote sustainable development. We recommend:

1. **Establishing Community-Led Watershed Management Committees**: Partner with local communities to establish committees responsible for managing watersheds, promoting sustainable land use practices, and implementing early warning systems.
2. **Supporting Renewable Energy Projects**: Provide technical assistance and financial support to small-scale farmers transitioning to solar irrigation systems and promote renewable energy projects in peri-urban areas.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring water security (32.4% access to safely managed drinking water) [1] and clean energy access (53.3% electricity access), exacerbating climate vulnerability [2]. Climate change impacts are felt acutely, with droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events becoming more frequent and severe [3].

## Analysis

* **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa's water security is severely compromised with 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1].
* **Clean Energy Access**: Despite a global renewable energy consumption rate of 19.7%, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 53.3% electricity access (World Bank, 2023) [4]. This gap hinders industrial development and exacerbates poverty cycles.
* **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts are felt acutely in the region, with droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events becoming more frequent and severe.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Infrastructure Investment**: Invest in water treatment facilities and distribution networks to increase access to safe drinking water. Prioritize rural areas where infrastructure is least developed.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Implement policies that incentivize renewable energy projects, such as solar-powered wells and clean cooking solutions for peri-urban households. Provide subsidies and technical assistance to small-scale farmers transitioning to solar irrigation systems.
3. **Develop Climate Resilient Infrastructure**: Build climate-resilient water storage facilities like rainwater harvesting ponds in flood-prone areas.

## Implementation Considerations

* **Cost Analysis**: Initial investments will require significant financial support from both public and private sectors. Grants, concessional loans, and cost-sharing arrangements can help mitigate upfront costs.
* **Barriers to Implementation**: Political resistance to change, lack of skilled labor, and limited technical expertise are potential hurdles. Capacity building programs and training initiatives should be prioritized alongside policy implementation.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. By implementing evidence-based policies that prioritize rural areas and vulnerable populations, we can create a pathway to sustainable development and improved health outcomes. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and the private sector is essential for scaling up these interventions.

## Call to Action

Developed countries should provide financial support and technology transfer to help Sub-Saharan Africa meet its water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation goals. Development agencies must prioritize project funding in regions with limited resources. International cooperation can accelerate progress by sharing best practices and lessons learned from successful initiatives elsewhere.
