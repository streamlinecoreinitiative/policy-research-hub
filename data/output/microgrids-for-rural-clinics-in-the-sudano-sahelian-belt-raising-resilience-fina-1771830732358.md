**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to strengthen environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa by addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation simultaneously. The region faces unprecedented challenges due to climate change, with significant gaps in access to safe drinking water [NEEDS SOURCE] and electricity [NEEDS SOURCE]. To address these issues, we recommend implementing cost-effective, renewable energy solutions and prioritizing climate-resilient infrastructure projects like solar-powered wells and clean cooking systems.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, leading to frequent droughts and floods. The region's limited access to safe drinking water [NEEDS SOURCE] and electricity [NEEDS SOURCE] threatens public health, economic stability, and social cohesion. Climate-induced shocks further strain already fragile systems.

## Analysis

### Water Security Challenges

* Over 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water [Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022].
* Sub-Saharan Africa's access to safely managed drinking water is only 32.4% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024].

### Renewable Energy Gap

* Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is only 19.7% of total final energy consumption worldwide [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020].
* The global average for renewable energy consumption is 19.7%, with a significant gap in Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Climate Impacts

* Global temperature has risen by +1.1°C since pre-industrial levels [Source: IPCC AR6].
* Sub-Saharan Africa experiences more frequent and severe weather events, exacerbating water scarcity and infrastructure challenges.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase access to clean water**: Invest in solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting systems that can be installed at a lower cost than traditional infrastructure projects.
2. **Promote renewable energy adoption**: Implement subsidies for off-grid solar power systems, providing affordable electricity solutions that reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
3. **Enhance climate resilience**: Develop early warning systems for extreme weather events using satellite data and local meteorological stations. Implement sustainable land use practices to protect water sources and mitigate soil erosion.

## Implementation Considerations

* Estimated costs: [VERIFY] $1 billion over three years for solar-powered well installation in Sub-Saharan Africa, with potential savings from reduced energy costs.
* Potential barriers: Political resistance to change; limited financial resources; technical challenges in scaling renewable energy solutions. Address these by engaging stakeholders, securing funding partnerships, and training local technicians.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation through targeted interventions that build resilience against future shocks. By taking decisive action now, governments can create a more sustainable and prosperous future for their populations.
