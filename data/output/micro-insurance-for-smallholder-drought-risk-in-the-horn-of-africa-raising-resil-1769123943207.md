# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Horn of Africa: raising resilience finance for communities

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing investment in water infrastructure to improve access to safe drinking water. Specifically, governments and development partners should allocate funds for water infrastructure projects such as wells, pipelines, and purification facilities.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the world's poorest regions, with a significant population lacking basic services such as safe drinking water and electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Only 32.4% of the subregion has access to safely managed drinking water, while 53.3% have access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing drought frequency and intensity, further threatening water security and clean energy access.

### Analysis

Recent data from the World Bank shows that only 73.7% of the global population has access to safely managed drinking water, with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind at 32.4% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. In terms of electricity access, while 91.6% of the world population has access, this figure drops to 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Renewable energy consumption as a percentage of total final energy consumption is 19.7 globally, but only 8.6% in Sub-Saharan Africa [Source: World Bank Open Data].

### Policy Recommendations

To address the urgent needs of Sub-Saharan Africa, governments and development partners should prioritize the following interventions:

1. **Investment in Water Infrastructure**: Allocate funds for water infrastructure projects such as wells, pipelines, and purification facilities.
2. **Renewable Energy Expansion**: Support renewable energy projects such as solar, wind, and hydropower to increase electricity access. [VERIFY] A $3 million grant can power up to 20 villages, providing reliable electricity to approximately 1,000 people. [NEEDS SOURCE]
3. **Climate Resilience Programs**: Implement climate-resilient agricultural practices, early warning systems, and disaster preparedness plans to mitigate the impacts of droughts and floods.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning and coordination:

* Secure adequate funding from international donors, NGOs, and national budgets to support infrastructure development.
* Foster collaboration between government agencies, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and local communities in project implementation.
* Train local technicians and community leaders on maintenance and operation of new water and energy systems.

### Conclusion

Addressing the water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for improving health outcomes, boosting economic growth, and enhancing resilience. By investing in sustainable infrastructure and implementing climate-resilient programs, policymakers can create a brighter future for millions of people living in poverty.
