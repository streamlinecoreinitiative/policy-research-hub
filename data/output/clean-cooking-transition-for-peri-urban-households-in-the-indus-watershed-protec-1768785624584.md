# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Indus Watershed: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

This brief highlights the importance of addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, with a focus on peri-urban households in the Indus watershed. The proposed solution integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems to provide sustainable irrigation solutions for agriculture, thereby protecting livelihoods under climate stress.

## Introduction

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in many regions worldwide, including the Indus watershed. Peri-urban households are particularly vulnerable to climate-related shocks due to their reliance on traditional energy sources and limited access to clean water. This brief outlines a comprehensive approach to address these challenges through integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

### Current Irrigation Practices

Traditional irrigation methods in the region rely heavily on borehole pumps, which consume significant amounts of energy (10-20 kWh/day) [verify] and result in substantial losses due to evaporation and seepage. Canal systems also experience significant water loss through these processes.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Local surveys and case studies are needed to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from agroforestry practices.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide a sustainable and renewable energy source for irrigation. These systems can generate power ranging from 10-50 kW per system, with an energy efficiency of 70-80% [verify]. Economic analysis is needed to compare the costs and benefits of micro-hydro systems.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated solutions that combine agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective outcomes. Total project costs per hectare range from $10,000-$25,000 [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Subsidies for farmers, grid integration with micro-hydro systems, and infrastructure development are key recommendations.

### Needed Evidence

1.  **Climate Data**
    - NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Indus watershed (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).

2.  **Economic Analysis**
    - Economic analysis of traditional irrigation costs.
    - Economic analysis of micro-hydro systems.

3.  **Socioeconomic Studies**
    - Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct local surveys and case studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from agroforestry practices.
2.  Develop economic analysis of traditional irrigation costs and micro-hydro systems.
3.  Implement policy measures, such as subsidies for farmers and grid integration with micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

Addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries requires a comprehensive approach that integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems. By protecting livelihoods under climate stress, these solutions can help ensure food security and promote sustainable development in the Indus watershed. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of these interventions and inform policy decisions.
