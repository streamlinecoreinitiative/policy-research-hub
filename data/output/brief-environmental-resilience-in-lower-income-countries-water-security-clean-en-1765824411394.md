# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

**Executive Summary**

Environmental resilience is critical for lower-income countries to ensure sustainable development, reduce poverty, and improve human well-being. This brief highlights the key challenges and opportunities in three essential areas: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. It also emphasizes the importance of financing, policy frameworks, and community engagement in achieving environmental resilience.

**Section 1: Water Security Challenges**

Water scarcity is a pressing issue in many lower-income countries, affecting millions of people worldwide. Understanding the critical need for sustainable water management is essential given the scarcity of freshwater resources.

* **Key Data Points Needed:**
	+ Percentage of population lacking access to safe drinking water (estimated at around 844 million people globally).
	+ Annual average rainfall and its variability in key regions (data available from World Bank, "Water Supply and Sanitation").
* **Sources to Consult:**
	+ World Bank, "Water Supply and Sanitation"
	+ United Nations, UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Water and Development Indicators (GLAAS)

**Section 2: Clean Energy Solutions for Lower-Income Countries**

Access to clean energy is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and improving health outcomes. However, many lower-income countries still lack access to electricity.

* **Key Data Points Needed:**
	+ Proportion of households with access to electricity (estimated at around 87% globally).
	+ Installed renewable energy capacity per capita (data available from International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook).
* **Sources to Consult:**
	+ International Energy Agency (IEA), World Energy Outlook
	+ United Nations, Sustainable Development Goals Report

**Section 3: Climate Adaptation Strategies in Lower-Income Countries**

Effective climate adaptation strategies are necessary for mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, many lower-income countries lack the resources and capacity to implement such strategies.

* **Key Data Points Needed:**
	+ Number of people affected by extreme weather events annually (estimated at around 143 million people globally).
	+ Percentage of land area at risk from desertification and droughts (data available from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Special Report).
* **Sources to Consult:**
	+ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Special Report
	+ World Bank, "Climate Change Adaptation"

**Section 4: Financing for Environmental Resilience Initiatives**

Securing adequate funding is critical for implementing environmental resilience projects. However, many lower-income countries face significant financing gaps.

* **Key Data Points Needed:**
	+ Total public and private investment in climate-related projects (estimated at around $500 billion annually).
	+ Cost-effectiveness ratios of different adaptation measures.
* **Sources to Consult:**
	+ OECD, Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Database
	+ World Bank, "Financing Climate Change Adaptation"

**Section 5: Policy Frameworks for Environmental Resilience**

Establishing robust policy frameworks is essential for guiding sustainable development efforts. However, many lower-income countries lack effective policy frameworks.

* **Key Data Points Needed:**
	+ Number of countries with climate change adaptation policies in place (estimated at around 120 countries globally).
	+ Proportion of national budgets allocated to environmental protection and resilience.
* **Sources to Consult:**
	+ United Nations, Global Environment Outlook
	+ OECD, Environmental Performance Reviews

**Section 6: Community Engagement and Local Ownership**

Involving local communities is vital for ensuring the sustainability and effectiveness of environmental initiatives. However, many lower-income countries lack effective mechanisms for community engagement.

* **Key Data Points Needed:**
	+ Percentage of community-led projects that are successful in achieving their goals (estimated at around 50% globally).
	+ Levels of public participation in decision-making processes related to environmental policies.
* **Sources to Consult:**
	+ Local Ministries, Case Studies
	+ United Nations, Sustainable Development Goals Report

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Conduct a thorough review of existing data and research to identify specific regions or countries where data is most lacking.
2. Collaborate with international organizations to fill these gaps through research projects, data collection initiatives, and knowledge sharing platforms.
3. Develop targeted policy frameworks and programs to support environmental resilience in lower-income countries.
4. Establish mechanisms for community engagement and local ownership in environmental initiatives.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience is critical for lower-income countries to ensure sustainable development, reduce poverty, and improve human well-being. By addressing the key challenges and opportunities outlined in this brief, policymakers can develop effective strategies to support water security, clean energy access, climate adaptation, financing, policy frameworks, and community engagement.
