# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Sahel: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy Adoption, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend implementing a micro-insurance program for smallholder drought risk. This initiative will provide financial protection to farmers against crop failure due to droughts, enabling them to invest in climate-resilient agricultural practices. By targeting rural areas with limited access to safe drinking water and electricity, this program can help bridge the critical gaps in water security, clean energy adoption, and climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with severe water scarcity ([VERIFY] 32.4% of the population lacking access to safely managed drinking water) [1] and high rates of energy poverty ([VERIFY] 53.3% of the population lacking electricity access) [2]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods [3]. The region's limited resources for water supply and energy generation are further strained by climate variability.

## Analysis

The region consumes ([VERIFY] 9.2% of total freshwater withdrawal globally) while hosting approximately one-third of the world’s population without reliable access to safe drinking water or electricity [4]. Renewable energy consumption is only ([VERIFY] 19.7%), far below global averages [5].

## Policy Recommendations

To strengthen water security, clean energy adoption, and climate resilience in sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend the following specific actions:

1. **Expand Water Supply Infrastructure**: Invest in desalination plants and advanced water purification technologies to improve access to safe drinking water. Targeted investments should focus on rural areas where infrastructure is most lacking.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the use of solar panels and small wind turbines for off-grid communities. Implement feed-in tariffs to incentivize private investment in renewable energy projects, particularly in remote regions.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Measures**: Build early warning systems for floods and droughts. Develop climate-resilient agricultural practices such as agroforestry and intercropping that can withstand changing weather patterns.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require substantial funding from both public and private sectors. Governments should consider leveraging international development funds and partnerships with foreign entities to finance infrastructure projects. NGOs and community-based organizations play a crucial role in grassroots initiatives, providing technical assistance and direct support to communities.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa urgently needs robust policies that enhance water security, promote clean energy adoption, and bolster climate resilience. By adopting these actionable recommendations, stakeholders can make significant strides towards improving the lives of millions living in poverty and vulnerability.
