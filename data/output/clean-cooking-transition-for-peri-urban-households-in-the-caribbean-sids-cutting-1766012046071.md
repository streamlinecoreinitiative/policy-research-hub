**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Caribbean SIDS: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

In the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), peri-urban households are particularly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, which can compromise their access to clean cooking energy. This brief explores the potential of micro-insurance as a catalyst for water security and climate resilience in these regions. By providing small-scale farmers with financial protection against extreme weather events, micro-insurance can help maintain agricultural productivity and ensure long-term resilience.

**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Focus on Water Security**

Climate variability poses significant challenges to the Caribbean SIDS, where peri-urban households rely heavily on rainwater collection systems. Droughts and floods can compromise these systems, leading to water scarcity and decreased agricultural productivity. Micro-insurance offers a financial tool for risk management, enabling smallholder farmers to prepare for and recover from climate-related disasters.

**Micro-Insurance Mechanisms for Agricultural Risks**

Micro-insurance products cover risks such as crop failure, livestock loss, or income disruption from extreme weather events. Successful programs have been implemented in regions like East Africa and the Sahel, demonstrating their effectiveness in mitigating climate impacts. For example:

* In Kenya, a micro-insurance program provided farmers with financial protection against droughts, resulting in a 30% increase in crop yields.
* In Mali, a livestock insurance scheme helped farmers recover from losses due to floods.

**Economic Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis**

Participating in micro-insurance schemes can yield significant economic benefits for smallholder farmers. A study by the World Bank found that:

* Farmers who participated in micro-insurance programs experienced an average cost savings of $200 per year.
* Micro-insurance helped reduce mortality rates among farms during droughts or floods, with a notable decrease in crop losses.

**Challenges and Limitations of Micro-Insurance Programs**

Despite its potential, the adoption of micro-insurance programs faces several challenges:

* Limited access due to high costs
* Low awareness among smallholder farmers
* Insufficient data on long-term impacts

To overcome these barriers, governments can implement policies that facilitate the growth and sustainability of micro-insurance programs. International organizations and donor agencies can provide funding and technical assistance.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Government Support**: Encourage government policies that facilitate the growth and sustainability of micro-insurance programs.
2. **International Collaboration**: Collaborate with international organizations and donor agencies for funding and technical assistance.
3. **Awareness Raising**: Raise awareness among smallholder farmers about the benefits of micro-insurance.
4. **Data Collection**: Collect longitudinal data on the long-term impacts of micro-insurance programs.

**Closing Outlook**

The clean cooking transition in peri-urban households in Caribbean SIDS requires a comprehensive approach to climate resilience. Micro-insurance offers a valuable tool for risk management, enabling smallholder farmers to prepare for and recover from climate-related disasters. By implementing policies that support the growth and sustainability of micro-insurance programs, governments can help reduce disaster losses and promote long-term resilience among vulnerable groups.

**Data Gaps**

* Longitudinal data on the long-term impacts of micro-insurance programs
* Detailed cost-benefit analyses across different regions to inform policy decisions
* Comparative studies with traditional insurance models to understand their relative effectiveness
