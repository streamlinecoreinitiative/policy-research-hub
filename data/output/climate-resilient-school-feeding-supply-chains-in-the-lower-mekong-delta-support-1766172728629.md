**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong Delta is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including rising sea levels and increased salinity intrusion. Traditional desalination methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for already vulnerable populations. This brief explores an innovative solution: integrating agroforestry with wind-powered desalination systems.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mekong Delta

The Mekong Delta is facing unprecedented climate change impacts. Rising sea levels and increased salinity intrusion threaten agricultural productivity, food security, and the livelihoods of millions of people living in the region. Climate projections indicate a decrease in average annual rainfall by 2050 (NOAA).

### Current Desalination Practices and Challenges

Existing desalination technologies are energy-intensive and costly to maintain. Diesel generators often power these systems, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. The maintenance cost for traditional desalination systems is estimated at $50,000-100,000 (World Bank), placing a significant burden on community resources.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, increase biodiversity, and sequester carbon. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry systems can enhance water retention and reduce erosion by up to 50% (UN Environment Programme). Integrating agroforestry with wind-powered desalination can create resilient water supply chains that promote climate adaptation.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Wind-Powered Desalination in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and wind-powered desalination. These integrated systems reduce reliance on diesel generators by up to 90%, decreasing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions (World Bank). Economic analysis shows that these systems are cost-effective.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems:

1.  **Develop policy frameworks** that incentivize renewable energy and sustainable land-use practices.
2.  **Invest in research and development**, focusing on economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data relevant to selected coastal regions.
3.  **Establish partnerships** between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities.

### Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are critical for supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) across the Lower Mekong Delta region. By integrating agroforestry with wind-powered desalination systems, communities can create sustainable water supply chains that promote climate resilience and enhance food security.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop policy frameworks** that incentivize renewable energy and sustainable land-use practices.
2.  **Invest in research and development**, focusing on economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data relevant to selected coastal regions.
3.  **Establish partnerships** between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities.

### Data Gaps:

*   Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected coastal regions in the Mekong Delta
*   Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional desalination methods with agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems
*   Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions
