# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing severe droughts and heatwaves that impact agricultural productivity and food security. The school feeding program, serving millions of children across the region, is particularly susceptible to these effects. This brief explores integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into climate-resilient irrigation supply chains for school feeding programs in the Horn of Africa.

## Addressing Water Scarcity and Poverty through Integrated Solutions

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Horn of Africa

Climate change exacerbates droughts and heatwaves in the region, leading to severe water scarcity and poverty. Rising temperatures reduce crop yields, while changing precipitation patterns disrupt irrigation systems. The consequences are far-reaching, affecting millions with food insecurity, malnutrition, and decreased economic stability.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems rely heavily on diesel generators and boreholes, which are often inefficient and prone to water loss. Studies indicate that a significant portion of water is lost through evaporation and seepage into the ground, wasting precious resources and increasing energy consumption and costs.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into farming systems, farmers can reduce erosion, retain water, and increase crop yields.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for irrigation efficiency in the Horn of Africa. These small-scale hydroelectric systems harness energy from rivers and streams to power irrigation pumps, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient water supply. These integrated approaches improve irrigation efficiency while enhancing soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

### Key Recommendations:

1.  **Support policy frameworks** that encourage the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in school feeding programs.
2.  **Develop training programs** to build capacity among farmers, extension agents, and policymakers on integrated climate-resilient agriculture practices.
3.  **Invest in research and development** to improve the efficiency and scalability of micro-hydro technology.

### Closing Outlook

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security and human health in the Horn of Africa. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into school feeding supply chains, we can improve water security, reduce food losses, and enhance health outcomes for children. It is essential that policymakers, practitioners, and researchers work together to support the adoption of these integrated approaches at scale.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop a regional policy framework** to promote agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in school feeding programs.
2.  **Establish a knowledge-sharing platform** for farmers, extension agents, and policymakers to exchange experiences and best practices.
3.  **Conduct further research** on the economic impact of integrated climate-resilient agriculture practices.

### Needed Evidence:

1.  **Climate Data:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Horn of Africa (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2.  **World Bank Reports:**
    *   "Renewable Energy Consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa" focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).
    *   "Access to Electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa," providing data on electricity access (% of population).
