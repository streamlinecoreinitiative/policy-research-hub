**Enhancing Environmental Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), the region is at a critical juncture where immediate and targeted interventions are needed. This policy brief recommends prioritizing investments in infrastructure improvements for water security and renewable energy sources while integrating climate adaptation measures.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with limited access to clean drinking water compared to global averages, highlighting a critical health disparity (World Bank, 2024). Climate change exacerbates existing challenges, including droughts and floods, which threaten both water security and energy systems. The region's renewable energy consumption stands at just [VERIFY] % globally in 2020.

### Analysis

The analysis reveals that:

* Only [53.3%] of the Sub-Saharan African population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), leaving millions without reliable power sources.
* Renewable energy remains underutilized despite its potential for sustainable development, with a global consumption rate of 19.7% in 2020 (World Bank, 2021).
* Climate change necessitates robust adaptation strategies, given the increased frequency and intensity of weather events.

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Expand Water Supply Infrastructure**
	* Develop and implement plans to construct or rehabilitate water supply systems in underserved areas.

2. **Promote Renewable Energy Access**
	* Encourage private sector investments through tax incentives and subsidies for renewable energy projects, particularly in rural and remote regions.

3. **Strengthen Climate Resilience Measures**
	* Invest in early-warning systems to mitigate the impact of climate events on water supply and energy infrastructure.

### Implementation Considerations

Estimated investments required for water supply projects range from $1-$3 billion, with renewable energy initiatives costing approximately [VERIFY] per project. Limited financial resources and resistance to change by local communities may hinder implementation.

### Conclusion

Policymakers must prioritize these interventions as they are crucial for improving water security, ensuring reliable access to clean energy, and enhancing climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. Developing comprehensive plans with clear timelines and allocating necessary resources will ensure successful implementation of recommended policies.
