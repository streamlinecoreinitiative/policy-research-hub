**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sahel: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region faces severe environmental challenges, including water scarcity and heatwaves, which exacerbate health issues among peri-urban households. This brief highlights the importance of transitioning to clean cooking practices using agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in Ethiopia**

The Ethiopian Highlands are a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change. Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from highland wetlands have significant impacts on agriculture. Traditional irrigation methods exacerbate poverty among smallholder farmers by being energy-intensive and costly. The World Bank reports that renewable energy adoption is crucial for Africa's economic growth, with a focus on solar and wind power (World Bank, 2020).

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Ethiopian Highlands include boreholes and canals. However, these methods result in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage. A study by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found that inefficient irrigation practices lead to substantial water losses (UNEP, 2019). The average annual rainfall in selected highland regions of Ethiopia is [verify].

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience and Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Agroforestry systems improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies have shown that agroforestry systems can improve water retention and reduce erosion (Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture, 2020). Micro-hydro technology is a small-scale hydroelectric system that reduces reliance on diesel generators and increases energy efficiency.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. Economic analysis has shown cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up (World Bank, 2020). However, detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems are needed.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

1. **Support policy frameworks that promote the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation systems**.
2. **Develop training programs for farmers on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro practices**.
3. **Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia**.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sahel region's transition to clean cooking practices using agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation is crucial for improving health outcomes in heatwaves. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro technology, smallholder farmers can enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop a comprehensive policy framework to support the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation systems**.
2. **Establish training programs for farmers on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro practices**.
3. **Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and long-term climate data relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia**.
