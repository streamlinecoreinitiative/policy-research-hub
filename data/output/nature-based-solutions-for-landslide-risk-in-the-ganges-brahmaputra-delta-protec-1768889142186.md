# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and ecologically sensitive regions in the world, facing significant climate-related challenges. Rising sea levels, increased precipitation, and land subsidence have exacerbated landslide risk, threatening the livelihoods of millions of people. To address this crisis, we recommend investing in nature-based solutions that integrate green infrastructure into existing development projects.

## Context & Challenge

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is home to over 150 million people, with an estimated 40% living below the poverty line [1]. Climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including landslides, floods, and cyclones. According to NASA's Earth Observatory, the region experienced a significant increase in landslide incidence between 2010 and 2020, but the exact percentage is unclear [2].

## Analysis

The current approach to managing landslide risk relies heavily on engineering-based solutions, which often displace communities and destroy ecosystems. In contrast, nature-based solutions can provide multiple benefits while minimizing social and environmental impacts. For example:

*   Planting mangroves along coastlines can reduce wave energy by up to 90% [3].
*   Restoring wetlands can increase groundwater recharge by up to 30% [4].

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance landslide resilience in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, we recommend:

1.  **Integrate Green Infrastructure into Development Projects**: Incorporate nature-based solutions into existing infrastructure projects, such as coastal protection walls and flood control systems.
2.  **Establish Community-Led Ecosystem Restoration Programs**: Support community-led initiatives to restore degraded ecosystems, including mangroves, wetlands, and forests.
3.  **Develop Climate-Resilient Land Use Planning**: Encourage climate-resilient land use planning that balances economic development with environmental conservation.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a multi-stakeholder approach involving government agencies, NGOs, private sector entities, and local communities. Initial costs for infrastructure development may be substantial but can be offset by long-term benefits such as reduced disaster risk, improved livelihoods, and enhanced ecosystem services.

## Conclusion

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is facing unprecedented climate-related challenges that threaten the livelihoods of millions of people. By investing in nature-based solutions that integrate green infrastructure into existing development projects, we can reduce landslide risk, enhance ecosystem resilience, and promote sustainable development.
