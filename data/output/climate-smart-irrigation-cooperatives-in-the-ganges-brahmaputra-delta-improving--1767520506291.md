**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, with millions of people relying on agriculture for their livelihood. Climate change poses significant threats to food security and public health due to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. This brief outlines a proposal for establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, leveraging agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems to improve water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity**

Climate change is having a profound impact on agriculture in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and increased frequency of heatwaves. The region experiences significant precipitation variability, with average annual rainfall ranging from 800-1200 mm [verify]. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, but specific data on their efficiency is lacking.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Climate Resilience**

Traditional irrigation practices in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta are often unsustainable and inefficient. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution, improving soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while providing sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation. However, specific benefits such as increased soil organic matter (2-8%), biodiversity increase (15-30 native species), and carbon sequestration (3-7 tons/ha/year) require verification.

**Section 3: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective solutions for climate-resilient water supply. However, the total project costs per hectare ($10,000-$25,000) and return on investment (ROI: 3-5 years) are unsubstantiated claims that require verification.

**Section 4: Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives. Key policy recommendations include:

* Subsidies for farmers to encourage the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure development, including roads, storage facilities, and other improvements

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts on agriculture in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
2. Develop a detailed plan for establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, including agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
3. Provide subsidies and incentives to farmers to encourage adoption of these integrated systems.
4. Invest in grid integration and infrastructure development to enhance reliability and efficiency.

**Closing Outlook**

The establishment of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta has the potential to improve health outcomes, increase food security, and promote sustainable agriculture practices. By leveraging agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we can address severe water scarcity, provide clean energy access, and enhance climate adaptation in this critical region.
