# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts and water scarcity that affect millions of people. The transition to clean cooking practices is essential for improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing resilience in peri-urban households.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges

### Water Security

* Severe water scarcity affects agriculture, industry, and households in lower-income countries.
* Climate change exacerbates erratic rainfall patterns, reducing crop yields and food security.
* Existing irrigation systems often rely on diesel generators, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

### Clean Energy

* Access to electricity is limited in many peri-urban areas, with an estimated [verify] percentage of the population without access to electricity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.
* Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, offer a promising solution for clean cooking and energy needs.

### Climate Adaptation

* Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns require innovative adaptation strategies, including climate-resilient agriculture and water management practices.

## Integrated Solutions: Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

* Agroforestry systems improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
* Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in reducing erosion and improving water retention.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

* Small-scale hydroelectric systems (micro-hydro) offer a reliable source of energy for irrigation and other needs.
* Benefits include reduced reliance on diesel generators, increased energy efficiency, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Raising Resilience Finance for Communities: Policy Recommendations

1.  **Invest in Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Allocate funds for the development of climate-resilient irrigation systems, including agroforestry-based micro-hydro projects.
2.  **Promote Renewable Energy**: Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, for clean cooking and energy needs.
3.  **Support Climate Adaptation Measures**: Provide financial support for community-led climate adaptation initiatives, including agroforestry and water management practices.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households is crucial for improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing resilience in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By investing in integrated solutions, such as agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we can address water security, promote clean energy, and adapt to climate change.
