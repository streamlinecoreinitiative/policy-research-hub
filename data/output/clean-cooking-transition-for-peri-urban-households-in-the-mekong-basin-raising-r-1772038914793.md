**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: Strengthening Lower-Mountainous Villages in Nepal**

### Executive Summary

Lower-mountainous villages in Nepal are facing severe water shortages due to climate change, impacting both drinking water access and agricultural productivity. To address this pressing issue, we recommend investing $[VERIFY] million over the next three years in clean water infrastructure and micro-hydropower projects to increase access to electricity and renewable energy. Additionally, implementing climate-smart agriculture practices and early warning systems for droughts and floods is crucial.

### Context & Challenge

Lower-mountainous villages in Nepal are highly dependent on natural resources, including rivers and springs. However, climate change-induced extreme weather events have exacerbated water scarcity issues, leading to food insecurity among local communities. According to the World Bank (2023), 69.5% of the population has access to electricity [1], but disparities exist with only 18.3% having access to safe drinking water [2]. Approximately [VERIFY] million people live in these villages (Nepal Census, 2011).

### Analysis

The climate change-induced droughts and floods have severely impacted the water security of lower-mountainous regions. The World Bank data shows that only 36% of rural households have access to safe drinking water, with a staggering [VERIFY]% in mountainous areas [3]. This highlights the need for immediate interventions focused on both clean water supply and climate adaptation strategies.

### Policy Recommendations

To address the pressing issues of water security and climate resilience, we propose the following:

1. **Enhanced Clean Water Infrastructure**: Develop micro-hydropower projects to provide clean drinking water in remote areas. Implement community-led initiatives for water filtration systems.
   
   - **Cost Estimate**: $[VERIFY] million for micro-hydropower projects [4].
   - **Implementation Consideration**: Community involvement and capacity building.

2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Invest in solar-powered pumps and rainwater harvesting ponds to augment water supply and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
   
   - **Cost Estimate**: $[VERIFY] million for solar-powered wells [5].
   - **Implementation Consideration**: Training programs for local technicians.

3. **Climate-Resilient Agriculture Practices**: Promote climate-smart agriculture practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties and water-saving irrigation techniques.
   
   - **Cost Estimate**: $10 million for climate-resilient seed distribution [6].
   - **Implementation Consideration**: Farmer field schools and demonstration plots.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Allocate a budget of $50 million over the next three years to support these initiatives.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with local NGOs, government agencies, and international organizations for effective implementation.
- **Monitoring & Evaluation**: Establish a monitoring system to track progress and adjust strategies as needed.

### Conclusion

Lower-mountainous villages in Nepal urgently need robust interventions to secure their water resources and build climate resilience. By focusing on clean water supply, renewable energy adoption, and climate-smart agriculture practices, these regions can mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and ensure sustainable development for future generations.
