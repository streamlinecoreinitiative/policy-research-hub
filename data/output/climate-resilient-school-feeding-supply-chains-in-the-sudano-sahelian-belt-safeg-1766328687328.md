# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to water security and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. This region is vulnerable due to its arid climate, limited water resources, and dependence on rain-fed agriculture. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to address severe water scarcity and poverty.

## Introduction

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is characterized by high temperatures, low rainfall, and limited water resources. Climate change exacerbates these conditions, leading to increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods. The region's agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable, with rain-fed crops being the primary source of income for many households.

### Water Scarcity Impacts

* Reduced crop yields due to drought
* Increased food prices due to scarcity
* Decreased economic stability and poverty exacerbation [verify]

## Climate-Resilient Irrigation Solutions

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address water scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. This approach integrates agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric power generation, providing a reliable source of clean energy for irrigation.

### Agroforestry Benefits

* Improved soil health and fertility
* Enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services
* Reduced erosion and increased water retention [verify]

### Micro-Hydro Systems

* Increased efficiency in water use (efficiency rates vary depending on system design)
* Reduced reliance on diesel generators and decreased greenhouse gas emissions
* Potential for community-scale energy generation and sale

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro

Pilot projects in the Sudano-Sahelian belt demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. These projects show that:

* Communities can generate a significant portion of their electricity needs through micro-hydro power (exact percentage not specified)
* Agroforestry practices improve water retention, reducing erosion and increasing crop yields [verify]

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation solutions in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, we recommend:

1. **Policy Support**: Governments should provide incentives for communities to adopt agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Capacity Building**: Training programs should be established to equip communities with the skills and knowledge necessary to implement these solutions.
3. **Scaling Up**: Efforts should be made to scale up successful pilot projects, ensuring wider adoption and replication.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sudano-Sahelian belt require innovative solutions that address water scarcity, clean energy, and climate adaptation. The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising approach to ensure food security, economic stability, and sustainability in this region.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1. **Establish Policy Support**: Governments should provide incentives for communities to adopt agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Develop Capacity Building Programs**: Training programs should be established to equip communities with the skills and knowledge necessary to implement these solutions.
3. **Scale Up Successful Pilot Projects**: Efforts should be made to scale up successful pilot projects, ensuring wider adoption and replication.

### Needed Evidence Snippets:

1. **World Bank Report:** "Access to Electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa," providing data on electricity access (% of population).
2. **Mexican Ministry of Agriculture Publication:** "Agroforestry Practices and Their Impact on Water Management" (case studies from the Mesoamerican Highlands).
3. **NOAA Climate Dataset:** Specific regions in the Sudano-Sahelian belt (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
