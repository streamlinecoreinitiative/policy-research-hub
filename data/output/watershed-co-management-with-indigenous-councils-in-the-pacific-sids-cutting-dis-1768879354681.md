**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Pacific SIDS: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**
Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With only 32.4% of the region's population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), and less than half accessing electricity (World Bank Open Data), urgent action is needed to improve these critical areas. This policy brief recommends investing in water infrastructure, promoting clean energy adoption, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies to strengthen resilient societies.

**Context & Challenge**

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with severe challenges in accessing safe drinking water ([VERIFY] 32.4%) and electricity ([VERIFY] 53.3%) (World Bank Open Data). These deficiencies threaten health, economic stability, and climate resilience. In contrast, [NEEDS SOURCE] of the world has access to safely managed drinking water, highlighting a significant gap in Sub-Saharan Africa.

**Analysis**

### Water Security Challenges

* Limited safe drinking water availability: Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data).
* Poor sanitation infrastructure leading to waterborne diseases: Freshwater withdrawal accounts for [VERIFY] % of resources globally (World Bank Open Data).

### Clean Energy Status

* Low renewable energy consumption: Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% globally, but only [NEEDS SOURCE] in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank Open Data).
* High dependence on fossil fuels for electricity generation: The global population lacking safe water is estimated to be [NEEDS SOURCE] people (UN-Water/WHO).

### Climate Adaptation Needs

* Vulnerability to climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods: SDG 6 progress indicates that only [NEEDS SOURCE]% of the global coverage has safely managed water (UN SDG Report 2023).

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Invest in piped water supply, sanitation facilities, and hygiene education**: Allocate $10 billion over 5 years for water security investments.
2. **Promote rainwater harvesting and decentralized water treatment systems**: Support community-based initiatives to increase access to safe drinking water.
3. **Increase public investment in renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind power**: Invest [NEEDS SOURCE] in clean energy over the next 5 years.
4. **Implement feed-in tariffs to encourage private sector participation in clean energy generation**: Provide incentives for private companies to invest in renewable energy.
5. **Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters using satellite imagery and IoT sensors**: Enhance community-based disaster risk reduction programs with [NEEDS SOURCE] over the next 5 years.

**Implementation Considerations**

* Costs: Estimated $10 billion over 5 years for water security investments, [NEEDS SOURCE] for clean energy, and [NEEDS SOURCE] for adaptation measures.
* Potential barriers: High upfront costs, limited access to financing, resistance from traditional power sectors.
* Overcoming challenges: Utilize grants, concessional loans, and partnerships with international organizations.

**Conclusion**
Governments must prioritize water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. By scaling up these interventions, Sub-Saharan Africa can build a more resilient future for its people.
