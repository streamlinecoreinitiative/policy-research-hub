**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to integrate mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance into national adaptation plans (NAPs) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, a highly vulnerable region in South Asia, is facing unprecedented climate-related challenges, including sea-level rise, increased frequency of cyclones, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. By investing in mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance, countries can not only enhance their NDCs but also support the resilience of communities and ecosystems.

## Context & Challenge

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and climate-vulnerable regions globally. According to World Bank data (2022), [1] only 35% of the population in Bangladesh has access to safely managed drinking water, while in India, this figure stands at 42%. [2] The recent IPCC report highlights that the region is expected to experience a sea-level rise by 2050, exacerbating the risk of coastal erosion and flooding. [3]

## Analysis

Mangrove forests play a critical role in protecting coastlines from storms and erosion, while also providing habitat for diverse marine life. However, these ecosystems are under threat due to deforestation, overfishing, and pollution. According to a study published in the journal Science (2020), [4] mangroves can sequester carbon per unit area. By restoring mangrove forests, countries can not only enhance their blue carbon stocks but also support adaptation efforts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Integrate Mangrove Restoration into NAPs and NDCs:** Incorporate mangrove restoration as a key component of national adaptation plans and Nationally Determined Contributions to enhance climate resilience.
2. **Establish Blue Carbon Finance Mechanisms:** Develop financing mechanisms, such as carbon credits or green bonds, to support mangrove restoration efforts and promote sustainable livelihoods for local communities.
3. **Support Climate-Resilient Water Management:** Invest in climate-resilient water management practices, including the use of drought-tolerant crops and improved irrigation systems, to enhance the resilience of agricultural systems.

## Implementation Considerations

* **Funding:** Secure funding through international cooperation, green bonds, or carbon credits to support mangrove restoration efforts.
* **Community Engagement:** Engage with local communities in the planning and implementation process to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed.
* **Technical Assistance:** Provide technical assistance to countries to develop and implement effective mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance mechanisms.

## Conclusion

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, with limited infrastructure for providing safe drinking water. By investing in mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance, countries can not only enhance their NDCs but also support the resilience of communities and ecosystems. We urge governments to integrate these initiatives into their national adaptation plans and Nationally Determined Contributions to ensure a climate-resilient future.
