# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and poverty. Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution by integrating agroforestry practices with micro-hydro systems for efficient and sustainable irrigation. This brief presents an overview of the current irrigation challenges in the region, the benefits of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, and the potential for climate-resilient water supply through their integration.

**Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt spans across several countries in West Africa, including Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity in the region, with projected declines in rainfall and increased evaporation rates due to warmer temperatures [verify]. Agriculture is a significant contributor to the region's economy, but irrigation systems are often inefficient.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian belt include boreholes, canals, and traditional flood-based methods. However, these systems suffer from high water loss rates due to evaporation and seepage [verify]. Moreover, diesel generators are often used to power irrigation pumps, leading to increased energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration in the Sudano-Sahelian belt [verify]. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, agroforestry systems can reduce erosion, increase water retention, and promote more efficient use of rainfall. Case studies from Mali and Burkina Faso demonstrate the potential for agroforestry to improve water availability and reduce irrigation costs.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable alternative to diesel generators for powering irrigation pumps. Small-scale hydroelectric systems can harness energy from rivers or streams, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions [verify]. Micro-hydro systems have been successfully implemented in several countries, including Rwanda and Nepal.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects in the Sudano-Sahelian belt have demonstrated the potential for integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to create climate-resilient water supply. By combining tree planting with micro-hydro energy generation, farmers can reduce irrigation costs, increase crop yields, and improve water security [verify]. Economic analysis of these pilot projects highlights the cost-effectiveness of this integrated approach.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt:

1.  **Develop policies to incentivize the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems**: Governments can offer subsidies, tax breaks, or low-interest loans to farmers who adopt these integrated approaches.
2.  **Establish training programs for farmers and extension agents**: Capacity building is essential to ensure that farmers understand the benefits and implementation requirements of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.
3.  **Conduct further research on economic impact and community engagement**: More studies are needed to quantify the economic benefits of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives and to explore ways to engage local communities in their development.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution for addressing water scarcity and poverty in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By integrating agroforestry practices with micro-hydro systems, farmers can reduce irrigation costs, increase crop yields, and improve water security. With policy support and further research, this integrated approach has the potential to contribute significantly to achieving adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in the region.
