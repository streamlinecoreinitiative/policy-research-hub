# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Andean Highlands: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant threats to food security, livelihoods, and human well-being in lower-income countries. The Andean highlands are particularly vulnerable due to their fragile ecosystems, limited resources, and reliance on climate-sensitive agriculture. This brief highlights the importance of integrating environmental resilience into school feeding supply chains in this region.

## Climate Change Impacts and Existing Irrigation Systems

Climate change is exacerbating droughts, floods, and temperature fluctuations in the Andean highlands, affecting agricultural productivity and household livelihoods. Traditional irrigation systems are often inefficient and reliant on diesel generators, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions [verify].

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration (e.g., [Case Study 1], [Case Study 2]). By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion, increase water retention, and promote more resilient crops.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution to reduce water loss from traditional irrigation systems. By harnessing local water resources, micro-hydro systems can provide clean energy for pumping water, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing overall efficiency [verify].

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential for combining agroforestry with micro-hydro technology to create climate-resilient irrigation systems. These integrated approaches can reduce water scarcity, promote sustainable agriculture, and enhance food security for rural communities.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of these integrated solutions at scale:

1.  **Develop policy frameworks** that incentivize agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Invest in capacity building** for farmers, extension services, and local governments to promote knowledge sharing and best practices.
3.  **Support research** on economic impact, community engagement, and scaling up these integrated approaches.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Andean highlands require a holistic approach that integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation efficiency. By leveraging these integrated solutions, we can reduce water scarcity, promote sustainable agriculture, and enhance food security for rural communities.

Changes made:

- Removed speculative claim about 30% evaporation and 5% seepage rates as it lacks a source.
- Kept the title as it is specific to the topic.
- Flagged numbers lacking sources with "[verify]".
- Preserved length and structure.
