# microgrids for rural clinics in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Farmers: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems in the Mekong Basin**

Executive Summary:

The Mekong Basin is one of the most critical freshwater ecosystems globally, supporting over 60 million people and numerous endangered species. However, smallholder farmers in this region face significant climate-related risks, including droughts, floods, and water scarcity, which threaten their livelihoods and the ecosystem's resilience. This brief explores the potential of micro-insurance as a tool to safeguard freshwater ecosystems by protecting smallholder farmers from these risks.

**Climate Change Vulnerability in Lower-Income Countries: A Global Perspective**

Lower-income countries are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change impacts due to limited resources, infrastructure, and institutional capacity. The Sudano-Sahelian belt, which spans across West Africa, is one of the most affected regions globally. Climate-related events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves have severe consequences for rural communities, including water scarcity, food insecurity, and loss of livelihoods.

**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

In the context of the Sudano-Sahelian belt, microgrids can play a critical role in supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Microgrids are decentralized energy systems that provide reliable and sustainable power to remote communities. By integrating renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power with energy storage solutions, microgrids can:

• **Ensure water security**: Pumping groundwater for irrigation and drinking water
• **Provide clean energy**: Powering healthcare facilities, schools, and community centers
• **Support climate adaptation**: Enabling early warning systems for extreme weather events

**Success Stories from the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

Several initiatives in the region have successfully integrated microgrids with rural clinics to improve access to clean energy and water. For example:

• The _Solar Home System_ initiative in Mali provides solar-powered lighting, phone charging, and radio communication to rural communities
• The _Renewable Energy for Rural Health Care_ project in Burkina Faso installs solar-powered healthcare facilities, including water treatment systems

**Key Data Points Needed:**

To further develop microgrid solutions for rural clinics in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, the following data points are needed:

• **Population density of communities served by microgrids**: To estimate the scale of impact
• **Average annual energy savings per household**: To quantify the economic benefits of microgrid adoption
• **Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions**: To assess the climate mitigation potential of microgrid solutions

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop a regional framework for microgrid development**: Encourage collaboration among governments, NGOs, and private sector actors to establish standards and best practices for microgrid implementation.
2.  **Invest in capacity building and training**: Support local communities and healthcare workers with the necessary skills to operate and maintain microgrids.
3.  **Pilot large-scale microgrid projects**: Demonstrate the feasibility of microgrid solutions for rural clinics, focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

**Closing Outlook:**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change impacts. Microgrids can play a critical role in supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs by providing reliable and sustainable power to remote communities. By investing in microgrid development, we can safeguard freshwater ecosystems, improve access to clean energy and water, and support climate resilience in lower-income countries.
