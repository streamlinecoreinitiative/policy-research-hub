**Protecting Livelihoods in Drylands: Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience through Integrated Approaches**

## Executive Summary

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where over [VERIFY] % of the population lives in dryland areas facing severe water scarcity and climate-induced shocks, enhancing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is crucial for sustainable development. This policy brief recommends implementing microgrids for rural clinics, promoting solar cold-chain for fisheries, and investing in nature-based solutions for landslide risk to bolster these critical sectors.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate shocks due to its arid conditions. Water scarcity affects millions, leading to food insecurity and health issues (World Bank Open Data). Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are depleting natural water resources faster than they can be replenished (UN-Water/WHO).

## Analysis

Evidence shows that [VERIFY] % of the world has access to safely managed drinking water, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, this drops to just 32.4% (World Bank Open Data). Climate change and poor infrastructure exacerbate this disparity. Increased frequency and intensity of droughts have led to reduced groundwater recharge and surface water availability (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Promote Microgrids for Rural Clinics**
	* Deploy solar-powered microgrids in rural clinics, providing reliable electricity for health services (e.g., refrigeration).
	* Evidence: Solar energy can significantly improve healthcare outcomes by ensuring uninterrupted power supply.
	* Implementation Considerations: Cost ($100-$200 per clinic), potential regulatory approvals required, and need for local maintenance.

2. **Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries**
	* Implement solar-powered cold-chain systems to preserve fish during transportation from catch to market (e.g., refrigerated trucks).
	* Evidence: Solar power can extend shelf life of perishable goods by reducing temperature fluctuations.
	* Implementation Considerations: Initial investment cost ($10,000 per truck), need for local solar panel installation and maintenance.

3. **Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk**
	* Develop and implement nature-based solutions (e.g., reforestation, landslide stabilization structures) in high-risk areas.
	* Evidence: Natural ecosystems can reduce the risk of landslides by absorbing excess water and stabilizing soil.
	* Implementation Considerations: Cost ($20-$50 per tree), need for local community engagement and capacity building.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Microgrids: $100-$200 per clinic; Solar cold-chain systems: $10,000 per truck; Nature-based solutions: $20-$50 per tree.
* Potential Barriers: Limited financial resources, regulatory hurdles for implementing solar technology, and community resistance to nature-based solutions.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in dryland regions is essential for sustainable development. By adopting these integrated approaches, governments and NGOs can improve livelihoods while mitigating the impacts of climate change. Collaboration between stakeholders will be key to successful implementation.

**Recommendation:** Governments and NGOs should prioritize implementing microgrids for rural clinics, promoting solar cold-chain for fisheries, and investing in nature-based solutions for landslide risk to bolster water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in dryland regions.
