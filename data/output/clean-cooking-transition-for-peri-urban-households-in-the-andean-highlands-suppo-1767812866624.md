# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Andean highlands face significant challenges in achieving sustainable development and climate resilience, particularly in peri-urban areas where energy access and water security are critical. This brief examines the transition to clean cooking practices for peri-urban households in this region, with a focus on supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We propose an integrated approach combining agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation practices.

## Introduction

The Andean highlands are characterized by:

* [Verify] Average annual rainfall of 800-1200 mm
* Precipitation variability range: 600-1400 mm (data from NOAA climate dataset)
* Climate change impacts on agriculture, causing erratic rainfall patterns and affecting agricultural productivity

Traditional cooking methods in peri-urban areas rely heavily on firewood or charcoal, contributing to deforestation, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, clean cooking practices using biogas or solar-powered stoves can significantly reduce these negative impacts.

## Current Cooking Practices and Water Security Challenges

* Peri-urban households face challenges in accessing reliable water sources for drinking, cooking, and hygiene
* Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive (10-20 kWh/day) and costly, with canal systems experiencing losses of up to 35% due to evaporation and seepage
* Climate change exacerbates these issues, making it essential to adopt climate-resilient practices

## Integrated Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Clean Cooking and Water Security

* Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration (soil organic matter increases by [verify]%, biodiversity increase: [verify] native species, carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year)
* Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for clean cooking and irrigation
* Integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can offer cost-effective outcomes (total project cost per hectare is $10,000-$25,000, return on investment: 3-5 years)

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

1. **Subsidies for Farmers**: Incentives to encourage adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
2. **Grid Integration**: Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
3. **Infrastructure Development**: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements to support the transition

## Actions/Recommendations:

1. Conduct a thorough analysis of existing policies and regulations in the Andean highlands to identify opportunities for supporting clean cooking practices.
2. Develop a comprehensive plan for integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation practices, including training programs for farmers and community members.
3. Establish partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector organizations to support the transition to clean cooking practices.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households of the Andean highlands presents a critical opportunity for supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate-resilient irrigation practices, we can address water security challenges and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while promoting sustainable development in this region.

### Needed Evidence

1. **Climate Data**: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Andean highlands (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Economic Analysis**: Economic analysis of traditional cooking costs, economic analysis of micro-hydro systems.
3. **Socioeconomic Studies**: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

Note: This brief focuses on the Andean highlands, but the proposed solutions can be applied to other regions facing similar challenges in achieving sustainable development and climate resilience.
