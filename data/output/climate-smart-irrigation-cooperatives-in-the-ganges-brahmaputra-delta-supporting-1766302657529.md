**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the world's most densely populated and vulnerable regions to climate change, with frequent flooding and droughts impacting agriculture and livelihoods. Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for water security and renewable energy use in this region.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change. Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from its vast wetlands have significant impacts on agriculture, affecting food security and economic stability for smallholder farmers.

*   Climate change projections indicate an increase in the frequency and severity of droughts.
*   Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta include boreholes and canals. However, these systems suffer from high water loss through evaporation and seepage.

*   Evaporation rates from open channels and reservoirs are significant.
*   Seepage losses occur due to inadequate canal linings and poor maintenance.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate that agroforestry systems can also improve water retention and reduce erosion.

*   Agroforestry practices such as alley cropping and silvopasture have been implemented successfully in the region.
*   Benefits include improved crop yields, increased income for farmers, and enhanced ecosystem services.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology involves small-scale hydroelectric systems that can provide renewable energy for irrigation. This approach reduces reliance on diesel generators and increases energy efficiency.

*   Micro-hydro systems have been implemented in various locations worldwide.
*   Benefits include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved water security, and increased energy independence.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro for climate-resilient irrigation. Economic analysis shows cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

*   Integrated systems can provide multiple benefits, including improved water security, increased energy efficiency, and enhanced ecosystem services.
*   Scaling up these initiatives requires policy support and investment in infrastructure development.

### Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we recommend:

1.  **Policy Support:** Governments can provide incentives for farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Infrastructure Development:** Investment in infrastructure development is necessary to support scaling up these initiatives.
3.  **Capacity Building:** Training and capacity-building programs are essential for farmers, extension workers, and policymakers.

### Future Research Directions

To further validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, we suggest:

1.  **Economic Impact Analysis:** Conducting detailed economic impact analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of these initiatives.
2.  **Community Acceptance Studies:** Investigating community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
3.  **Climate Change Impacts:** Assessing the resilience of these systems to projected climate change impacts.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Develop and Implement Policy Frameworks:** Governments should develop and implement policy frameworks that support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Invest in Infrastructure Development:** Investment in infrastructure development is necessary to support scaling up these initiatives.
3.  **Capacity Building Programs:** Training and capacity-building programs are essential for farmers, extension workers, and policymakers.

### Closing Outlook

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for addressing water scarcity and promoting renewable energy use in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By supporting policy frameworks, infrastructure development, and capacity building programs, we can ensure that these initiatives reach their full potential and contribute to achieving adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
