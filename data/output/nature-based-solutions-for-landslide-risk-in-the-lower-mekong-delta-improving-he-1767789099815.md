# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Lower Mekong Delta: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, experiencing frequent heatwaves and landslides that pose significant risks to human health. This brief highlights the importance of nature-based solutions in addressing these challenges.

## Introduction

### Context of Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Delta

The region's agricultural sector relies heavily on irrigation systems, which are often inefficient and unsustainable. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, leading to reduced crop yields, economic instability, and increased vulnerability to climate variability.

### Current Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation methods in the Lower Mekong delta are largely dependent on surface water and rain-fed systems, which are prone to inefficiencies and sustainability issues. Farmers rely heavily on these methods due to limited access to reliable irrigation systems, leading to reduced crop yields and economic instability.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

### Benefits of Integrating Agroforestry Practices

Agroforestry practices can improve water retention and recharge through increased vegetation cover, enhancing ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, and carbon sequestration. Successful projects in similar climates or contexts demonstrate the potential for agroforestry to increase agricultural productivity due to improved soil health and water management.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems can reduce water usage compared to traditional methods, offering cost savings through reduced energy consumption. These systems are typically lower-cost than large-scale hydro systems, with installation costs and maintenance considerations that support long-term sustainability.

## Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can enhance resilience by reducing environmental degradation through integrated management practices. This approach increases water security by diversifying water sources, reducing the risk of crop failure due to climate variability.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

### Key Policies Needed for Implementation

Public-private partnerships, regulatory frameworks, and collaborative efforts with local communities and organizations are crucial for successful implementation. Stakeholder involvement in decision-making processes is essential for policy adoption and implementation strategies.

### Areas of Research that Can Further Support this Initiative

Economic feasibility studies, long-term impact assessments, and lessons learned from successful projects can further support the initiative. Collaboration with local communities and organizations can facilitate replication and scaling up to other regions.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** that supports public-private partnerships, regulatory frameworks, and collaborative efforts with local communities and organizations.
2.  **Conduct economic feasibility studies** to assess the viability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in the Lower Mekong delta.
3.  **Establish a monitoring and evaluation system** to track the long-term impacts of these nature-based solutions on agricultural productivity, water security, and climate resilience.

## Closing Outlook

The implementation of nature-based solutions, such as agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, can significantly enhance the resilience of the Lower Mekong delta to climate change. By addressing water scarcity, improving irrigation efficiency, and promoting sustainable agriculture practices, these initiatives can improve health outcomes in heatwaves and reduce the risks associated with landslides.
