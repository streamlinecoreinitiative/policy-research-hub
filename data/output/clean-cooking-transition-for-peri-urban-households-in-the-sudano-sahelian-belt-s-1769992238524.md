# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries: A Comprehensive Strategy**

### Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring access to clean water, reliable electricity, and resilient infrastructure against climate change. To bridge this gap, we recommend implementing targeted policies that prioritize clean cooking solutions, promote agroforestry value chains, and enhance watershed co-management with indigenous councils.

**Key Findings:**

* Lower-income countries lag significantly in access to safe drinking water ([VERIFY] 32.4%)[1], electricity (53.3%)[2], and renewable energy ([VERIFY] 19.7%)[3].
* These gaps are critical for sustainable development, as highlighted by the need to achieve global development goals like SDG 6 (Water) and SDG 7 (Energy).

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces the most severe water scarcity issues, with only [32.4%][1] of its population having access to safely managed drinking water[1]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, leading to increased variability in rainfall patterns and rising temperatures that threaten existing infrastructure and livelihoods.

**Water Security:**

* Despite progress, only 73.7% of the world has access to safely managed drinking water[4].
* In Sub-Saharan Africa, this drops to a mere [32.4%][1], highlighting the urgent need for interventions[1].

**Clean Energy Access:**

* While global renewable energy consumption stands at [19.7%][3], in Sub-Saharan Africa it is only 53.3%[2], underscoring the necessity of scaling up clean energy solutions.

### Analysis

Recent research highlights the importance of addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to achieve sustainable development goals. For instance:

* The global population lacking safe water stands at [2.2 billion people][5].
* SDG 6 progress shows that only 74% of the world has safely managed water coverage[6].

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Supply Infrastructure**: Invest in desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and groundwater management projects in arid regions to improve access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration**: Increase subsidies for solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to reduce costs for rural households and communities.
3. **Support Clean Cooking Solutions**: Implement programs that provide access to affordable stoves and fuels such as biogas digesters or LPG cylinders to improve indoor air quality and reduce deforestation.

### Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in infrastructure can be substantial but yield long-term benefits, including improved health outcomes and economic growth. Overcoming political resistance, securing funding from international donors, and ensuring equitable distribution of resources are key challenges that require collaboration between governments, NGOs, and the private sector.

### Conclusion

Lower-income countries must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to achieve sustainable development goals. By adopting evidence-based policies and integrating community participation, these nations can build resilient societies capable of adapting to changing conditions while promoting economic growth and social equity.
