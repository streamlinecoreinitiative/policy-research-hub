# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Mekong basin: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt faces severe water scarcity challenges due to climate change and erratic rainfall patterns. This brief explores integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for irrigation, leveraging existing research and best practices from similar regions.

**Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt spans across 10 countries in West Africa. Climate change has led to erratic rainfall patterns, resulting in severe water scarcity. The region's agricultural sector is vulnerable, with crop yields affected by droughts.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems suffer from high water loss percentages: [verify] evaporation, seepage, and inefficiencies. Reliance on diesel generators exacerbates energy consumption.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate that agroforestry can enhance water retention and reduce erosion.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology reduces reliance on diesel generators and increases energy efficiency by [verify]%. Integrating micro-hydro with agroforestry creates a climate-resilient irrigation system.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have successfully integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for irrigation, demonstrating cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support adoption at scale:

1.  **Develop policies to incentivize the use of micro-hydro systems in agriculture**.
2.  **Provide training programs for farmers on agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies**.
3.  **Conduct further research on economic impact, community acceptance, and scaling up initiatives**.

### Needed Evidence Snippets

1.  **World Bank Report:** "Renewable Energy Consumption in West Africa" (latest report), focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).
2.  **Local Survey Data:** Results from surveys conducted within the Sudano-Sahelian belt to measure community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

### Needed Evidence

1.  **NOAA Climate Dataset:** Rainfall patterns over the past decade for specific regions within the Sudano-Sahelian belt (e.g., Nigeria, Chad).
2.  **World Bank Reports:** Renewable energy adoption in countries with similar climatic conditions (e.g., West Africa), focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).

### Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to address water scarcity and climate change impacts in the Sudano-Sahelian belt.
