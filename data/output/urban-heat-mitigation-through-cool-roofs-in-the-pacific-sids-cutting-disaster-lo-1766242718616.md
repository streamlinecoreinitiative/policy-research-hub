**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Pacific SIDS: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

**Executive Summary**

This brief focuses on addressing severe water scarcity in lower-income countries by integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, specifically in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt. The proposal aims to provide a comprehensive solution to climate change impacts through resilient irrigation methods, food security, and economic stability.

**Addressing Water Scarcity with Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems**

### **Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

Climate change is having a profound impact on water availability in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns. This has severe implications for food security and economic stability in the region.

### **Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt include boreholes and canals. However, these systems experience significant water loss due to evaporation and seepage. Improving the efficiency of these systems is crucial for addressing water scarcity.

### **Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has numerous benefits for soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate that agroforestry improves water retention and reduces erosion, making it an essential component of climate-resilient irrigation systems.

### **Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology is a small-scale hydroelectric system designed to reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency. Integrating micro-hydro with agroforestry can significantly improve the resilience of water supply systems in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

- **Supportive Policies:** Governments should implement policies that support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, including incentives for farmers and investors.
- **Research Priorities:** Further research is needed to understand the economic impact of these solutions on local communities and to identify areas for scaling up.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  Conduct a thorough analysis of existing irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt to determine water loss percentages [verify].
2.  Develop case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in improving water retention and reducing erosion.
3.  Establish partnerships with local governments, farmers, and investors to support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to address severe water scarcity in lower-income countries. By addressing immediate water scarcity issues and contributing to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption, this approach can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations.
