# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Caribbean SIDS: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in Caribbean SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges with water security, energy access, and climate adaptation. To address these issues, we recommend implementing climate-resilient water supply systems that incorporate renewable energy solutions. This approach can enhance both energy accessibility and water management in the region, ensuring sustainable development under a changing climate.

Key findings from recent data underscore the urgency of this issue:

* Sub-Saharan Africa has only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024).
* The region also lags behind in electricity access with just 53.3% of the population having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's natural environment is characterized by arid conditions, frequent droughts, and unpredictable rainfall patterns. These factors severely impact freshwater availability. Climate change has intensified these challenges, making traditional water supply systems increasingly vulnerable.

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity and affects agricultural productivity, leading to food insecurity. Implementing resilient water supply systems that integrate renewable energy solutions can mitigate these impacts.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a dire situation with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This statistic underscores the critical need for improved water supply systems.

### Energy Access

While 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), this figure is woefully inadequate given the high energy demands associated with climate-resilient infrastructure. Renewable integration can help bridge this gap.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change affects agricultural productivity and leads to food insecurity. Implementing resilient water supply systems that integrate renewable energy solutions can mitigate these impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Climate-Resilient Water Supply Systems**:
   - Develop cost-effective, climate-resilient water infrastructure such as rainwater harvesting and desalination plants.

2. **Integrate Renewable Energy Solutions**:
   - Promote the use of solar-powered pumps and microgrids to ensure reliable energy supply for water treatment and distribution systems.

3. **Enhance Community Participation**:
   - Engage communities in planning, implementation, and maintenance of climate-resilient water supply projects to ensure sustainability.
   - Research suggests successful community involvement leads to higher project success rates (World Bank, 2024).

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing climate-resilient water systems can be expensive but offers long-term savings through reduced energy costs and improved efficiency. Potential barriers include:

* Limited financial resources: Governments may struggle to fund such projects.
* Infrastructure challenges: Existing infrastructure often needs renovation or integration with new solutions.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize climate-resilient water supply systems that integrate renewable energy solutions to address its pressing water and energy security issues. By adopting these policies, we can enhance both the energy accessibility and water management in the region, ensuring sustainable development under a changing climate.
