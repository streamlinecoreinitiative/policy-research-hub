# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Andean highlands: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Enhancing Environmental Resilience: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief emphasizes the urgent need for Sub-Saharan African countries to address water security (32.4% access to safely managed drinking water) [1] and electricity access (53.3%) challenges. The region lags behind global averages in renewable energy consumption at 9.2%. To bridge this gap, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Andean highlands as a model for sustainable water management and renewable energy integration.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental resilience challenges due to historical underinvestment and natural resource limitations [2]. The region has the lowest access to safely managed drinking water among all regions worldwide, with over 100 million people lacking safe water sources. Moreover, only about half of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity, leaving millions in darkness.

## Analysis

### Water Security

* Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024): 32.4 [1]
* Freshwater withdrawal (% of resources) - World (2021): 9.2 [3]

### Energy Access

* Access to electricity (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2023): 53.3 [4]
* Global access to electricity (%) - World (2023): 91.6 [5]

### Renewable Energy Consumption

* Renewable energy consumption (%) - World (2020): 19.7 [6]
* Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is significantly lower at [VERIFY] 9.2% [7]

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Governments should invest in climate-resilient water management systems, such as irrigation cooperatives that integrate solar-powered pumps and drip irrigation systems.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Projects**: Encourage investment in solar, wind, and hydro projects to increase renewable energy consumption. Collaborate with international partners for technology transfer and financing mechanisms.
3. **Implement Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure such as flood barriers and drought-resistant crops to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

* Funding Mechanisms: Establish dedicated funds from both domestic and international sources, including grants and loans, for water security and renewable energy projects.
* Community Engagement: Engage local communities in planning and maintenance activities to ensure sustainability. Provide training on climate resilience practices and sustainable resource management.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address its water security, energy access, and climate adaptation challenges through targeted interventions supported by robust policy frameworks. By establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a model for sustainable water management and renewable energy integration, the region can pave the way for sustainable economic growth and improved living standards for millions of people.
