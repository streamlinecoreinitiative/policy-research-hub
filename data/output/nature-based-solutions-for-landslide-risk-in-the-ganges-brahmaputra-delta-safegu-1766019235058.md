**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

**Executive Summary**

The Indian subcontinent faces significant water security challenges due to climate change, severe water scarcity, and pollution issues that threaten agricultural productivity and public health. Climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives offer a collaborative approach to mitigate these challenges while fostering economic growth. This brief highlights the importance of promoting climate-smart irrigation practices in the region, focusing on the benefits of cooperative models, key interventions needed for climate-resilient irrigation, policy recommendations, and support mechanisms.

**I. Introduction to Water Security Crisis**

The Indian subcontinent is experiencing a severe water security crisis due to:

* **Water scarcity**: The average annual rainfall in India has decreased by 10% over the past few decades (Source: Ministry of Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation, Government of India).
* **Pollution issues**: Over 70% of India's surface water bodies are polluted, posing significant risks to human health and agriculture (Source: National Institute of Rural Development, NIRD).
* **Agricultural productivity**: Water scarcity affects over 60% of India's agricultural land, resulting in crop losses worth billions of dollars annually (Source: World Bank, "Agriculture Sector Assessment for India").

**II. Current Irrigation Practices & Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods, such as flood irrigation and sprinkler systems, are:

* **Inefficient**: Only 30-40% of applied water is absorbed by crops, while the remaining water evaporates or runs off (Source: World Bank, "Agriculture Sector Assessment for India").
* **High-cost**: Traditional irrigation methods consume significant amounts of energy and resources, leading to high costs for farmers.
* **Environmentally degrading**: Excessive use of water and chemicals harms freshwater ecosystems, contributing to soil salinization and land degradation.

**III. Climate-Resilient Irrigation Cooperatives**

Climate-resilient cooperative models offer a collaborative approach to irrigation management, with benefits including:

* **Improved water efficiency**: Cooperative members share knowledge, resources, and costs, leading to increased water savings.
* **Enhanced crop yields**: Climate-resilient crops and farming techniques increase agricultural productivity while reducing environmental impact.
* **Economic growth**: Cooperative models foster economic growth by providing farmers with access to finance, technology, and markets.

**IV. Key Interventions Needed for Climate-Smart Irrigation**

To promote climate-smart irrigation practices in the Indian subcontinent:

* **Climate-resilient crops**: Planting drought-tolerant and disease-resistant crops suitable for the region's climate conditions.
* **Farming techniques**: Implementing conservation agriculture, mulching, and cover cropping to reduce soil erosion and retain moisture.
* **Technology adoption**: Integrating drip irrigation, smart water management systems, and precision agriculture to optimize water use.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Establish a national program to promote climate-resilient cooperative models in the Indian subcontinent.
2. Develop policy frameworks to support cooperative formation and provide financial incentives for farmers adopting climate-smart practices.
3. Collaborate with local governments, NGOs, and international organizations to share knowledge, resources, and best practices.

**Closing Outlook**

Safeguarding freshwater ecosystems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta requires a collaborative approach to irrigation management. Climate-resilient cooperative models offer a promising solution to address water security challenges while fostering economic growth. By promoting climate-smart irrigation practices, we can ensure sustainable development in lower-income countries like India and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

**Data Gaps:**

* Detailed breakdown of water usage efficiency within different types of irrigation systems.
* Specific climate-resilient crops suitable for various regions in the Indian subcontinent.
* Quantitative data on financial and social impacts of cooperative models.
