# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong basin: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Mekong Basin: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts. To enhance environmental resilience, we recommend prioritizing investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation measures. Specifically, governments and development partners should allocate more resources to improve access to safe drinking water through improved sanitation facilities, water purification systems, and community-based water management programs [1]. Additionally, policies that encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines for off-grid communities, should be implemented to address energy poverty [2].

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries often lack the financial resources and infrastructure to meet basic needs like safe drinking water and electricity. These regions are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. The United Nations SDG 6 targets indicate only 74% of global population has access to safely managed water [3], with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging at 32.4% [1].

## Analysis

### Water Security

Despite significant progress (73.7% globally), Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with only 32.4% access to safe drinking water [1]. Water scarcity and contamination pose severe risks, leading to high rates of waterborne diseases. Improved sanitation facilities, water purification systems, and community-based water management programs can help address these challenges.

### Clean Energy Access

Only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity [2]. This disparity not only hampers economic development but also exacerbates climate vulnerability through increased reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation. Renewable energy sources, such as solar PV panels and wind turbines, can help bridge this gap.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change projections suggest an increase in extreme weather events, which threaten water security and clean energy infrastructure. Without adequate adaptation measures, the impacts of these changes will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Security**: Allocate more resources to improve access to safe drinking water through improved sanitation facilities, water purification systems, and community-based water management programs.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Access**: Implement policies that encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar PV panels and wind turbines for off-grid communities. Provide subsidies or grants to households and businesses to offset initial costs.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Develop early warning systems, build climate-resilient infrastructure, and support adaptation initiatives that integrate traditional knowledge with modern solutions.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in water security projects can range from $10-$20 per capita for improved sanitation facilities [4]. Political resistance to renewable energy policies and funding constraints are common challenges. Addressing these requires strong political will, public-private partnerships, and innovative financing mechanisms.

## Conclusion

By focusing on water security, promoting clean energy access, and enhancing climate resilience, lower-income countries can build sustainable infrastructures that protect their populations from environmental shocks. This not only improves health outcomes but also fosters economic growth and social stability. Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must collaborate to implement these recommendations effectively.
