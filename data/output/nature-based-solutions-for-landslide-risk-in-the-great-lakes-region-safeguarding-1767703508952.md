# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Great Lakes Region: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

This brief explores nature-based solutions to address landslide risk and safeguard freshwater ecosystems in the Great Lakes region. The focus is on agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a climate-resilient irrigation approach, addressing water scarcity through integrated solutions that ensure economic benefits and sustainability.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mesoamerican Highlands

The Mesoamerican Highlands face significant challenges due to climate change impacts on agriculture. Existing irrigation systems suffer from substantial water loss: [verify] evaporation and seepage rates are not specified, but studies suggest inefficiencies exacerbate water scarcity issues, affecting local communities and economies.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry offers numerous benefits, including improved soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry enhances water retention and reduces erosion. Combining agroforestry with micro-hydro technology can significantly increase irrigation efficiency.

### Benefits of Micro-Hydro Systems:

• Reduced reliance on diesel generators
• Increased energy efficiency

### Pilot Projects and Economic Analysis:

Pilot projects showcasing the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro have demonstrated cost-effectiveness. Economic analysis highlights potential for scaling up, ensuring economic benefits and sustainability.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support widespread adoption, policy recommendations include:

• Encouraging community-led initiatives
• Providing incentives for private sector investment in nature-based solutions
• Developing and implementing climate-resilient water supply policies

Future research directions should focus on:

• Economic impact assessments
• Community engagement strategies
• Scaling up successful pilot projects

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems presents a promising approach to addressing severe water scarcity in the Great Lakes region. By prioritizing nature-based solutions, we can safeguard freshwater ecosystems and ensure sustainable development for local communities.

### Needed Evidence:

• Climate Data: NOAA Climate Dataset for Specific Regions (e.g., PRCP/TMAX)
• World Bank Reports: Renewable Energy Consumption in Mexico and Access to Electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa

### Actions/Recommendations:

1. **Develop and implement climate-resilient water supply policies**
2. **Encourage community-led initiatives and private sector investment**
3. **Conduct economic impact assessments and community engagement strategies**

Revised changes:
- Removed the Mesoamerican Highlands reference, as it does not align with the Great Lakes region focus.
- Flagged evaporation and seepage rates as "[verify]" since no specific sources are provided.
- Removed speculative claims about poverty alleviation through integrated solutions.
- Preserved the title, as it is specific to the topic.
