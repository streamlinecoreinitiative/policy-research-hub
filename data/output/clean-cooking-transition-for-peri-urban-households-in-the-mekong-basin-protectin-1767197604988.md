# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Mekong Basin: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The clean cooking transition is crucial for peri-urban households in the Mekong basin, where climate stress and environmental degradation pose significant challenges to livelihoods. This brief explores the integration of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies to support sustainable development in this region.

## Introduction to Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity, affecting agricultural productivity, and increasing vulnerability to extreme weather events in lower-income countries. The Mekong basin, with its rich biodiversity and cultural heritage, is particularly vulnerable to these impacts. Addressing environmental resilience requires a comprehensive approach that integrates water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies.

### Key Challenges

* Severe water scarcity due to climate change
* Limited access to clean energy and cooking fuels
* Increased vulnerability to extreme weather events
* Environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges in the Mekong Basin

Traditional irrigation methods in the Mekong basin are often inefficient, relying on fossil fuel-based pumps and canal systems. These practices lead to significant water losses through evaporation and seepage.

### Case Studies

* Borehole pumps in rural areas: Energy consumption of [verify] kWh/day
* Canal systems: Water loss due to evaporation and seepage

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

* Soil organic matter: [verify]%
* Biodiversity increase: [verify]%
* Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year
* Case studies from similar regions (e.g., West Africa, East Africa)

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions for irrigation. Key data points include:

* Power generation: [verify] kW per system
* Energy efficiency: [verify]%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective, sustainable outcomes. Key estimates include:

* Total project cost: $[verify]-$[verify] per hectare
* Return on investment (ROI): [verify] years
* Long-term sustainability assessments

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Supportive policy environments are crucial for the adoption of sustainable solutions. Recommendations include:

### Actions/Recommendations

1. **Incentivize farmers**: Subsidies, low-interest loans, and tax breaks can encourage agroforestry-micro-hydro adoption.
2. **Grid integration**: Micro-hydro systems should be integrated with the national grid to ensure a stable energy supply.
3. **Infrastructure development**: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure are necessary for efficient irrigation and energy distribution.

## Closing Outlook

The clean cooking transition in peri-urban households of the Mekong basin requires a comprehensive approach that integrates water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies. By adopting agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, communities can protect livelihoods under climate stress while promoting sustainable development.
