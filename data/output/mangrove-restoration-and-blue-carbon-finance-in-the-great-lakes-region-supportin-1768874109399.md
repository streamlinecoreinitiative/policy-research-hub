**Renewing Water Security, Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the pressing need to address water scarcity in sub-Saharan Africa by leveraging clean energy solutions and climate adaptation strategies. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), we must act swiftly to enhance water security and reduce vulnerability. Our primary recommendation is to implement solar-powered water pumps and improve renewable energy consumption for electricity generation and heating.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity, with only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This region also lacks sufficient renewable energy consumption, at just 9.2% of total final energy consumption (World Bank, 2021). The World Bank data shows that global population lacking safe water is estimated to be 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), with sub-Saharan Africa being one of the most affected regions.

## Analysis

Water scarcity in sub-Saharan Africa is exacerbated by limited freshwater resources and a lack of sustainable management practices. The region's energy mix severely underutilizes renewable sources like solar and wind, which could provide sustainable alternatives for electricity generation and heating (World Bank, 2021). According to UN SDG Report 2023, global coverage for safely managed water is at [VERIFY] 74%, with sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind.

## Policy Recommendations

To address the pressing challenges in sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend:

* **Implement solar-powered wells**: Deploy solar-powered water pumps to reach remote communities that currently lack access to clean drinking water.
	+ Implementation Steps: Identify suitable sites, secure funding, and train local technicians.
	+ Costs: Estimated cost per pump: $10,000 – $25,000 (based on current market prices).
* **Promote renewable energy consumption**: Increase investment in solar and wind energy to boost renewable energy consumption.
	+ Implementation Steps: Establish policies promoting clean energy investments, subsidize installation costs for households and businesses.
	+ Costs: Estimated subsidies per household: [VERIFY] $50 – $100 annually (based on current subsidy rates).

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure successful implementation:

* **Geographic focus**: Target high-risk regions with severe water scarcity issues.
* **Training & capacity building**: Provide training programs to ensure sustainable maintenance and operation of solar-powered systems.

## Conclusion

Addressing the pressing challenges in sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted efforts to enhance access to clean drinking water through solar-powered solutions. By promoting renewable energy consumption, we can help mitigate climate change impacts. We urge governments and NGOs to invest in clean energy infrastructure and implement targeted programs for safe drinking water.
