# microgrids for rural clinics in the Great Lakes region: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Great Lakes Region: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends implementing microgrid systems in rural clinics across the Great Lakes region to enhance water security and energy access while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By leveraging renewable energy sources, such as solar power, and energy storage technologies, these microgrids can provide reliable electricity and clean water for critical healthcare services. We urge governments and NGOs to prioritize this initiative, investing $10 million in the next fiscal year to establish 50 pilot microgrid projects.

## Context & Challenge

The Great Lakes region faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity, particularly in rural areas. According to the World Bank, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, while 53.3% lack electricity [1]. Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing droughts and floods, which can contaminate water sources and disrupt power generation.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: In the Great Lakes region, a significant portion of freshwater withdrawals are for agriculture (World Bank). However, only 32.4% of the population has access to safe drinking water [1]. Climate change impacts, such as erratic rainfall and rising temperatures, threaten the reliability of water sources.
- **Clean Energy Access**: While 91.6% of the world's population has access to electricity [2], this drops significantly in the Great Lakes region (53.3%) [1]. The region relies heavily on fossil fuels for energy generation, leading to air pollution and health risks.
- **Climate Adaptation Needs**: With climate change, water scarcity and power outages will become more frequent. For instance, the World Bank projects that by 2050, up to a significant portion of the Great Lakes' population could be at risk from severe droughts [3].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Microgrid Systems**:
   - Collaborate with local healthcare providers to identify priority clinics for microgrid installations.
   - Invest in solar panels and energy storage systems to ensure reliable electricity supply.
   - Implement water harvesting and filtration systems to provide clean drinking water.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Analysis**: Initial investments will be significant but yield long-term benefits. For example, a solar-powered well project could cost $10,000 per installation [4], with return on investment through reduced maintenance costs over 5 years.
- **Barriers and Solutions**:
   - Political resistance to new policies can be addressed by engaging local stakeholders in planning processes.
   - Technological challenges are manageable with current innovations. For instance, solar-powered energy storage solutions like batteries have improved significantly in recent years.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and clean energy access in the Great Lakes region requires strategic policy interventions that prioritize climate-resilience. By implementing microgrid systems and promoting renewable energy integration, governments can enhance resilience to future climate shocks while improving public health outcomes and economic stability for vulnerable communities.

**Next Steps**: Engage policymakers in developing pilot projects and monitor their effectiveness to inform broader implementation strategies. Collaborate with international partners to secure additional funding and expertise needed for large-scale deployment.
