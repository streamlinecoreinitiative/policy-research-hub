**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Horn of Africa: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

We recommend establishing agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Horn of Africa to improve health outcomes during heatwaves. This approach can enhance water security, promote clean energy access, and foster climate resilience. By investing in infrastructure projects such as wells and boreholes, implementing rainwater harvesting systems, and promoting watershed co-management with indigenous councils, we can address the region's pressing challenges.

## Context & Challenge

The Horn of Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing frequent droughts and heatwaves that exacerbate water scarcity and electricity shortages. According to World Bank data, only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data], while renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. These gaps underscore the urgent need for policy interventions and innovative solutions to improve environmental resilience.

## Analysis

The data indicates a significant disparity between Sub-Saharan Africa's access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and worldwide coverage (73.7%) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, affecting water resources and leading to reduced agricultural productivity. For instance, the World Bank’s latest data shows that 2.2 billion people globally lack access to safely managed drinking water, with Sub-Saharan Africa contributing significantly to this number [Source: UN-Water/WHO].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Invest in infrastructure projects such as wells and boreholes.
	* Implement rainwater harvesting systems for rural communities.
	* Promote watershed co-management with indigenous councils.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Access**:
	* Increase government investment in renewable energy projects, particularly solar power.
	* Develop microgrids to improve access to electricity in remote areas.
	* Encourage community-based initiatives for off-grid solar systems.
3. **Adopt Climate Resilient Practices**:
	* Implement early-warning systems and last-mile alerts for droughts and floods.
	* Provide micro-insurance schemes for smallholder farmers to mitigate climate risks.
	* Develop water loss reduction strategies in secondary cities.

## Implementation Considerations

Cost estimates for implementing these recommendations vary, but initial investments are expected to yield long-term benefits. For instance, a study by the World Bank suggests that every $1 invested in clean energy projects can generate up to $3 in economic returns [Source: World Bank]. Community engagement is crucial; involving local leaders and community members ensures sustainable implementation and greater acceptance of new technologies or practices.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, promoting access to clean energy, and enhancing climate resilience are critical for the development and sustainability of Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing evidence-based policies and fostering collaborative efforts between governments, NGOs, and communities, it is possible to make significant strides towards a more resilient future. Collaboration across sectors will be key in overcoming existing barriers and ensuring that these initiatives lead to tangible improvements in people's lives.
