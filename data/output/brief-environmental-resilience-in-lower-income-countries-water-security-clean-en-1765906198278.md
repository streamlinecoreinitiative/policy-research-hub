# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Harnessing Renewable Energy to Secure Water Supplies in Rural Communities of Sub-Saharan Africa**

**Executive Summary:**
Sub-Saharan African regions face significant water scarcity challenges, exacerbated by climate change. Integrating renewable energy solutions can enhance water security and improve livelihoods for rural communities. This brief highlights the potential of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to pump water or desalinate seawater, using Kenya's successful Solar-Powered Desalination Plant in Mombasa as a case study. We analyze the economic impacts of renewable energy on water security, discuss current barriers, and suggest policy recommendations to support renewable energy projects.

**Challenges Faced by Sub-Saharan African Countries**

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 44% of the world's poorest countries, with many facing severe water scarcity challenges (UN World Water Development Report). Climate change has exacerbated these issues, leading to reduced rainfall and increased evaporation rates. The region's rural communities are disproportionately affected, with an estimated 70% lacking access to clean drinking water (World Bank's Climate Change and Development Knowledge Portal).

**Renewable Energy Solutions for Water Security**

Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can be used to pump water or desalinate seawater, providing a reliable source of fresh water. Solar-powered systems are particularly suitable for rural areas with abundant sunlight.

* **Solar-Powered Pumping:** Solar panels can power pumps to extract groundwater or surface water from rivers and lakes.
* **Wind-Powered Desalination:** Wind turbines can generate electricity to power desalination plants, providing fresh drinking water from seawater.
* **Hydroelectric Power:** Hydroelectric dams can generate electricity to pump water or power desalination plants.

**Case Study: Kenya's Solar-Powered Desalination Plant**

The Mombasa-based project uses solar energy to provide 100,000 liters of fresh drinking water per day. The plant has improved water security for local communities and created jobs in the region (IRENA).

* **Cost:** Initial investment costs were approximately $1 million.
* **Benefits:**
	+ Improved water security for rural communities
	+ Created jobs in the region
	+ Reduced reliance on fossil fuels

**Economic Impacts of Renewable Energy on Water Security**

Renewable energy projects can have significant economic benefits, including:

* **Job Creation:** Local employment opportunities in project development and maintenance.
* **Cost Savings:** Reduced fuel costs for water pumping and desalination.
* **Increased Economic Growth:** Improved water security can boost agricultural productivity and local economic growth.

**Challenges and Limitations**

Current barriers to widespread adoption of renewable energy solutions include:

* **Initial Investment Costs:** High upfront costs for project development and infrastructure.
* **Technological Limitations:** Limited scalability and efficiency of current technologies.
* **Policy Frameworks:** Inadequate policy support for renewable energy projects in water security initiatives.

**Policy Recommendations**

To support the integration of renewable energy solutions into water security initiatives, we recommend:

1. **Investment in Renewable Energy Infrastructure:** Governments should provide funding for infrastructure development and project implementation.
2. **Policy Frameworks:** Establish clear policies to support renewable energy projects, including tax incentives and streamlined permitting processes.
3. **Capacity Building:** Provide training and capacity-building programs for local communities and project developers.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Invest in renewable energy infrastructure to support water security initiatives.
2. Develop policy frameworks that support the integration of renewable energy solutions into water security projects.
3. Provide capacity-building programs for local communities and project developers.

**Closing Outlook:**
Harnessing renewable energy can significantly enhance water security in rural Sub-Saharan African communities. By investing in renewable energy infrastructure, developing supportive policies, and building local capacity, we can improve livelihoods and create economic opportunities for millions of people.
