**Climate Resilient Water Security and Clean Energy in Sub-Saharan Africa: Bridging Gaps for Sustainable Development**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and sustainable energy sources. With less than 50% of the region's population having access to clean water and only about [53.3%] with access to electricity [1], there is an urgent need for policy interventions that not only address immediate needs but also promote long-term resilience against climate shocks. To bridge this gap, we recommend:

* Expanding access to clean water by investing in building wells, boreholes, and other water supply systems to increase access to safe drinking water.
* Accelerating the deployment of renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind turbines, and small hydroelectric plants.
* Implementing integrated water management strategies that combine surface water, groundwater, and rainwater harvesting.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces one of the highest percentages of population lacking safe drinking water (32.4%) compared to the world average [73.7%] [2]. Similarly, only 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity, making energy access a critical issue [1]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, leading to more frequent and severe droughts and floods, which further strain water resources and power grids.

## Analysis

Despite significant improvements in safe drinking water over recent years (from 27.1% in 2015 to 32.4% in 2024) [3], Sub-Saharan Africa still struggles with access to clean water [2]. The region lags behind the world average for electricity access, with only about half of its population having reliable power. This disparity is even more pronounced in remote and underserved communities.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Water Infrastructure**: Invest $10-50 million per year in building wells, boreholes, and other water supply systems to increase access to safe drinking water. Prioritize rural areas where infrastructure is most needed.
2. **Renewable Energy Initiatives**: Accelerate the deployment of renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind turbines, and small hydroelectric plants. Provide subsidies or grants for households and businesses to adopt cleaner technologies.
3. **Integrated Water Management Systems**: Implement integrated water management strategies that combine surface water, groundwater, and rainwater harvesting to ensure sustainable water supply during droughts.

## Implementation Considerations

Costs: Estimated costs range from $10 million to $50 million per year for expanding water infrastructure in rural areas and deploying renewable energy systems. Potential barriers include lack of funding, technical expertise, or political support. Address these by partnering with international organizations, NGOs, and private sector entities.

## Conclusion

To achieve sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa, immediate action must be taken to enhance water security and promote clean energy access. By implementing the recommended policies and considering practical implementation steps, the region can build a more resilient future against climate-related challenges.
