# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Caribbean SIDS: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Caribbean SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including increased frequency and severity of natural disasters such as landslides. This brief explores the potential for integrating nature-based solutions with traditional infrastructure to manage landslide risk.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mekong Delta**

The Mekong Delta is a region facing significant climate change impacts, including rising sea levels and increased salinity intrusion. Climate change affects agriculture in the region by altering precipitation patterns, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.

* Climate change impacts on agriculture in the Mekong Delta:
	+ Rising temperatures: [verify] 1-2°C increase since 1960s
	+ Changes in precipitation patterns: more frequent droughts and floods
	+ Increased salinity intrusion: affecting agricultural productivity and food security

**Section 2: Current Desalination Practices and Challenges**

Traditional desalination technologies, such as solar distillation and reverse osmosis, are energy-intensive and costly. These methods have significant environmental impacts.

* Existing desalination technologies:
	+ Solar distillation: uses sunlight to evaporate seawater
	+ Reverse osmosis: uses pressure to force seawater through a semi-permeable membrane

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. These benefits can also enhance water retention and reduce erosion.

* Benefits of agroforestry for:
	+ Soil health: improved fertility and structure
	+ Biodiversity: increased species richness and abundance
	+ Carbon sequestration: storing atmospheric CO2 in vegetation and soil

**Section 4: Wind-Powered Desalination Systems**

Wind-powered desalination technology uses small-scale wind turbines to generate electricity, which is then used to power desalination systems.

* Overview of wind-powered desalination technology:
	+ Small-scale wind turbines (1-5 kW) generating electricity
	+ Electricity powering desalination systems (reverse osmosis or solar distillation)

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Wind-Powered Desalination in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and wind-powered desalination systems.

* Pilot projects demonstrating the combined use of agroforestry and wind-powered desalination:
	+ Research on integrated agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems in Southeast Asia
	+ Case studies showing cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Support policy frameworks**: Develop policies that encourage the adoption of nature-based solutions, such as agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems.
2. **Invest in research and development**: Fund further research on the integration of agroforestry and wind-powered desalination systems to improve their efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
3. **Engage with local communities**: Support community-led initiatives to develop and implement nature-based solutions that meet local needs and priorities.

**Closing Outlook**

The Caribbean SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including increased frequency and severity of natural disasters such as landslides. The integration of nature-based solutions with traditional infrastructure can provide a more resilient approach to managing landslide risk. Further research and development are needed to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems.

**Key Data Points Needed**

* Average annual rainfall in selected coastal regions of the Mekong Delta.
* Specific water loss percentages from existing desalination systems.
* Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-wind-powered desalination projects.

**Official Sources**

* UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
* World Bank
* ASEAN Secretariat

**Data Gaps**

* Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected coastal regions in the Mekong Delta.
* Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional desalination methods with agroforestry-wind-powered desalination systems.
* Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
