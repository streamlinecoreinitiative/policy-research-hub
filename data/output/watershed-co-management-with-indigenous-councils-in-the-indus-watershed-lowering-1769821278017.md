# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Indus watershed: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water insecurity, low electricity access, and inadequate renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in large-scale solar-powered wells to increase access to clean drinking water. This solution can be scaled up with minimal additional investment and leverages existing solar technology.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan African countries face significant disparities in basic services such as drinking water and electricity. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], while just over half have access to electricity (53.3%) [2]. This stark disparity underscores the urgent need for policy interventions that address these critical gaps.

## Analysis

The region's limited renewable energy consumption of 19.7% [3] highlights a pressing need for greater investment in solar and other clean energy sources to reduce carbon emissions and improve economic resilience. Climate change exacerbates water scarcity issues, with droughts becoming more frequent and severe [4]. These conditions necessitate robust adaptation strategies that include improved water management practices such as rainwater harvesting.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Implement large-scale solar-powered wells to increase access to clean drinking water in rural areas where traditional boreholes are unreliable or non-existent.
2. **Promote Solar-Powered Energy Solutions**: Invest in small-scale solar energy systems, particularly for off-grid communities. Provide subsidies or grants for households to install solar panels, thereby reducing their dependence on expensive and unreliable diesel generators.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods using satellite imagery and local weather data. Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices like agroforestry value chains in dry regions to improve water retention and soil health.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Analysis**: Initial costs for solar-powered wells range from $300-$500 per well, with ongoing maintenance at approximately $25-$40 annually [5]. Subsidies or grants can significantly reduce the upfront cost.
- **Barriers to Implementation**: Limited financial resources and political will are major barriers. Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and international development partners is crucial for successful implementation.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Regular audits of water quality and energy consumption should be conducted to ensure sustainable use of these solutions.

## Conclusion

Addressing water insecurity, promoting clean energy access, and enhancing climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa requires targeted, evidence-based policies. By investing in solar-powered wells, solar energy systems, and climate adaptation measures, governments can significantly improve the lives of their citizens while fostering long-term sustainability. We urge policymakers to take action and invest in these critical sectors to build a more resilient future for all.
