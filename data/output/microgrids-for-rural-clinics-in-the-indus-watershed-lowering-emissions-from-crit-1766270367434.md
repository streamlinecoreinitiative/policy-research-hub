# Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian Belt is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, facing severe impacts on food security and economic stability due to climate change. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems as a solution to address water scarcity in this region.

## Addressing Water Scarcity with Integrated Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt through erratic rainfall patterns, affecting agriculture and food security. Resilient irrigation methods are essential for economic stability and poverty reduction.

*   Climate change impacts on the region include:
    *   Erratic rainfall patterns
    *   Increased evaporation rates due to higher temperatures
    *   Decreased water availability for irrigation

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt, such as boreholes and canals, face significant challenges:

*   Water loss percentages from these systems: [verify]
    *   Evaporation
    *   Seepage
    *   High energy consumption for pumping water

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support adoption at scale, policy recommendations include:

*   Encouraging private sector investment in micro-hydro technology
*   Providing training for farmers on agroforestry practices
*   Developing policies to promote renewable energy consumption

Future research directions include:

*   Economic impact analysis of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
*   Community acceptance and benefits derived from these systems

## Key Data Points Needed

To validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro solutions, key data points are needed:

*   Average annual rainfall in selected regions (e.g., Nigeria, Chad)
*   Specific water loss percentages from existing irrigation systems: [verify]
*   Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects

## Needed Evidence Snippets

To support the proposal, evidence snippets include:

*   World Bank Report: "Renewable Energy Consumption in West Africa" (latest report), focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)
*   Local survey data: Results from surveys conducted within the Sudano-Sahelian belt to measure community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
*   NOAA Climate Dataset: Rainfall patterns over the past decade for specific regions within the Sudano-Sahelian Belt (e.g., Nigeria, Chad)

## Needed Evidence

To further validate the proposal, additional evidence is needed:

*   NOAA Climate Dataset: Specific regions in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt (e.g., Nigeria, Chad), focusing on rainfall patterns over the past decade
*   World Bank Reports: Renewable energy adoption in countries with similar climatic conditions (e.g., West Africa), focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)

## Rationale

The proposal focuses on integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to water scarcity and poverty. Key data points will validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these solutions, ensuring they are informed by existing research and best practices from similar regions.

### Closing Outlook

Addressing water scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt requires innovative solutions that balance economic viability with environmental sustainability. Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems offer a promising approach to achieve climate resilience while promoting renewable energy adoption and reducing poverty.
