# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Andean highlands: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces critical challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1] and a mere 53.3% accessing electricity (World Bank, 2023) [2], decisive action is needed to bridge these gaps and improve resilience. This policy brief recommends implementing resilient water management systems, promoting renewable energy adoption, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 1.3 billion people (UN Population Data) with vast geographical diversity and limited resources. The region faces high population growth rates, low access to water and electricity, and frequent climate-related shocks like droughts and floods. These issues threaten economic development, social stability, and environmental sustainability.

### Analysis

#### Access to Water Security:

* Sub-Saharan Africa has only 32.4% of the population with safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1].
* This low access rate is a result of inadequate infrastructure, financial constraints, and political instability.
* In contrast, the global average for safely managed drinking water access is 73.7% (World Bank, 2024) [1].

#### Access to Clean Energy:

* Only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023) [2].
* High costs and limited government investment are major barriers.
* Globally, 91.6% of the population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023) [2].

#### Climate Adaptation:

* The region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as erratic rainfall patterns and rising temperatures.
* Limited resources for early warning systems and disaster preparedness exacerbate these vulnerabilities.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Security Programs**: Invest in infrastructure projects like boreholes, water tanks, and sanitation facilities. Utilize existing funding mechanisms from international organizations to ensure sustainability.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage public-private partnerships for solar power mini-grids and community-based renewable energy initiatives to increase access to electricity.
3. **Climate Adaptation Initiatives**: Develop early warning systems and disaster risk reduction strategies, integrating climate change projections into planning processes.

### Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Initial investments in water management and renewable energy projects can be substantial but are justified by long-term benefits.
* Barriers: Political resistance to change, lack of skilled personnel, and high maintenance costs may hinder implementation.
* Solutions: Mobilize public-private partnerships for sustainable financing; train local communities on maintenance and operation.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must take decisive action to secure water resources, ensure clean energy access, and build climate resilience. By implementing evidence-based policies and fostering collaborative efforts among stakeholders, the region can achieve significant progress towards achieving SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and align with other sustainable development goals.

* **Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024)**: 32.4 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
* **Access to electricity (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2023)**: 53.3 [Source: World Bank Open Data]

**Additional Evidence Needed:**

* Detailed cost-benefit analyses for various water security and clean energy projects.
* Success stories of successful climate adaptation initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa to inform local implementation strategies.
* Comparative studies on the effectiveness of different renewable energy models (e.g., mini-grids vs. centralized solar power) in different regions.

This policy brief aims to provide actionable insights and data-driven recommendations for policymakers and practitioners aiming to enhance resilience in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation across Sub-Saharan Africa.
