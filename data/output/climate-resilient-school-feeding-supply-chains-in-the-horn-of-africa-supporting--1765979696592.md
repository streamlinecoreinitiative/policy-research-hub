**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe droughts and water scarcity. The school feeding sector plays a critical role in supporting food security and nutrition for millions of children in these countries. However, traditional supply chains are often inefficient and unsustainable, exacerbating the region's vulnerability to climate-related shocks. This brief argues that establishing climate-resilient school feeding supply chains is essential for achieving adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

**Climate Change Impacts on West African Drylands**

West Africa's drylands cover approximately [X]% of the region, with arid land areas expanding due to climate change. The average annual rainfall variation over the last decade has been significant, with some areas experiencing a decrease of up to [X]%. This increased aridity and reduced rainfall have severe consequences for agriculture, water security, and food production.

**Traditional Irrigation Systems' Limitations**

Existing irrigation systems in West Africa are often inefficient and unsustainable. Traditional methods consume large amounts of energy and water, leading to significant economic and environmental costs. These systems also perpetuate inequality, as small-scale farmers often lack access to resources and infrastructure. The inefficiency of these systems contributes to food insecurity and economic hardship for local communities.

**Promising Intervention: Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution to address the challenges faced by West African drylands. These cooperatives promote collective action, efficient resource management, and renewable energy sources for pumping water. By pooling resources and expertise, members can reduce costs, improve water use efficiency, and increase crop yields. Successful case studies from regions like Senegal and Mali demonstrate the potential of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives to enhance local communities' resilience to droughts and improve food security.

**Case Studies and Challenges**

Several case studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in West Africa:

* In Senegal, a cooperative system reduced water consumption by [X]% and increased crop yields by [X]%.
* In Mali, a similar initiative improved household incomes by [X]% and enhanced community resilience to droughts.

However, challenges remain, including:
	+ Initial investment costs for setting up cooperative systems
	+ Community buy-in and acceptance of new technologies
	+ Government support and international aid

**Policy Recommendations for Scaling Up**

To promote climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a sustainable strategy for ensuring water security in West African drylands, we recommend the following policy frameworks:

1.  National governments should establish policies and regulations to support the development of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.
2.  Regional organizations should provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for cooperative members.
3.  International donors and aid agencies should allocate resources to support the establishment and maintenance of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis comparing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives with traditional systems.
2.  Develop long-term economic impact studies on cooperative operations.
3.  Gather detailed community feedback and acceptance rates for these interventions.
4.  Establish partnerships between governments, international organizations, and local communities to support the scaling up of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Horn of Africa are essential for achieving adaptation targets outlined in NDCs under the Paris Agreement. By promoting climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, we can enhance water security, improve energy efficiency, and support sustainable agricultural practices in these vulnerable regions. With the right policy frameworks and international support, we can help West African drylands build resilience to climate-related shocks and achieve food security for millions of children.

**Data Gaps**

The following data gaps need verification:

* Specific cost-benefit analyses comparing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives with traditional systems
* Long-term economic impact studies on cooperative operations
* Detailed community feedback and acceptance rates for these interventions
