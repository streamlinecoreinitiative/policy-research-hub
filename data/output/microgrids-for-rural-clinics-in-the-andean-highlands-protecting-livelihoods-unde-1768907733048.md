**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Andean Highlands: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the pressing need to address water security, energy access, and climate adaptation challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. We recommend prioritizing investments in clean cooking solutions, expanding renewable energy infrastructure, and enhancing water management practices to ensure sustainable development. By doing so, decision-makers can significantly enhance resilience and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and National Determined Contributions (NDCs).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring universal water security and electricity access. According to World Bank data (2024), only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, while renewable energy consumption remains low at [VERIFY]%. These deficiencies not only threaten the health and well-being of millions but also impede economic growth and climate resilience.

## Analysis

The region's limited water security is a major obstacle to development. With less than one-third of the population having access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024), waterborne diseases remain prevalent, affecting health outcomes and productivity. Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in electricity generation, with only about half of the population having access (53.3% access rate, World Bank, 2023). This disparity contributes significantly to economic disparities and environmental degradation due to reliance on fossil fuels.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Clean Cooking Solutions**: Invest in clean cooking technologies such as biogas digesters and improved cookstoves to reduce indoor air pollution and improve health outcomes.
2. **Enhance Renewable Energy Infrastructure**: Prioritize the development of renewable energy projects like solar farms, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants. Provide subsidies for off-grid solutions and support community-based initiatives.
3. **Improve Water Management Practices**: Implement watershed co-management programs with indigenous councils to enhance water resources management and conservation efforts.

## Implementation Considerations

Addressing these challenges will require overcoming political resistance, lack of funding, and technical expertise gaps. We recommend developing a comprehensive plan for clean cooking transition that includes pilot projects, training programs, and market incentives. Similarly, outline strategies for renewable energy deployment including policy support and financial mechanisms.

## Conclusion

Decision-makers must prioritize investments in clean cooking solutions, renewable energy infrastructure, and water management practices to ensure sustainable development. By doing so, they can significantly enhance resilience and contribute to achieving the SDGs and NDCs. We urge governments, NGOs, and the private sector to work together to address these pressing challenges.
