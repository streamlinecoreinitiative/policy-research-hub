**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Lower Mekong Delta: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and erratic rainfall patterns. The school feeding supply chains in this region are susceptible to these impacts, threatening food security and livelihoods for millions of people. This brief outlines a comprehensive approach to building climate-resilient school feeding supply chains through the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Delta

The Lower Mekong delta is a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change. Erratic rainfall patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events have led to reduced crop yields, decreased food security, and increased poverty among smallholder farmers. Traditional irrigation methods exacerbate these issues by being energy-intensive and costly.

### Key Statistics:

* [Verify] Average annual rainfall in the Lower Mekong delta
* [Verify] Specific water loss percentages from existing irrigation systems

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

The current irrigation practices in the Lower Mekong delta rely heavily on diesel generators, which are expensive to operate and contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. These systems also suffer from high water losses through evaporation and seepage.

### Description of existing irrigation systems:

* Boreholes: [Verify]
* Canals: [Verify]

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water retention and reduce erosion.

### Case studies demonstrating the benefits of agroforestry:

* [Verify]

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology is a small-scale hydroelectric system that provides renewable energy for irrigation. This approach reduces reliance on diesel generators, decreases energy costs, and increases energy efficiency.

### Benefits of micro-hydro systems:

* Reduced greenhouse gas emissions
* Increased energy efficiency
* Decreased energy costs

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. These integrated approaches improve water security, enhance food production, and support sustainable livelihoods.

### Pilot project examples:

* [Verify]

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, we recommend the following policy actions:

1. **Develop and implement policies to promote agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems**: Governments should establish incentives for farmers to adopt these integrated approaches.
2. **Invest in renewable energy infrastructure**: Governments and development partners should invest in micro-hydro technology and other renewable energy solutions.
3. **Support capacity building and training programs**: Farmers, communities, and school feeding officials should receive training on the benefits and implementation of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

### Future research directions:

* Economic impact analysis
* Community acceptance studies

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are critical for protecting livelihoods in the Lower Mekong delta. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water security, improve food production, and support sustainable livelihoods.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Develop and implement policies to promote agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. Invest in renewable energy infrastructure.
3. Support capacity building and training programs for farmers, communities, and school feeding officials.
