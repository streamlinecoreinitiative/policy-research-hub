**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased temperatures. This brief focuses on enhancing environmental resilience through integrated agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation in lower-income countries, specifically targeting school feeding supply chains in the Great Lakes region.

**Introduction to Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts**

Climate change is characterized by erratic rainfall patterns, which severely impact agriculture in the Great Lakes region. [Verify] Average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm, with precipitation variability between 600-1400 mm. Traditional irrigation systems experience significant water loss due to evaporation and seepage.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Their Limitations**

Traditional methods are energy-intensive and costly, consuming a significant amount of energy (no specific data provided). The economic impact assessment reveals that the cost per hectare for traditional methods is [verify] $100-$200.

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Specific benefits include:

* Soil organic matter increases by 2-8% (source: [insert source])
* Biodiversity increase by 15-30 native species (source: [insert source])
* Carbon sequestration by 3-7 tons/ha/year (source: [insert source])

Case studies from other regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in enhancing climate resilience.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy. Specific data includes:

* Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system (no specific data provided)
* Energy efficiency is at [verify] 70-80%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

Benefits of micro-hydro systems include cost savings, energy efficiency, and reduced environmental impact.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects can provide cost-effective solutions. Specific data includes:

* Total project cost per hectare is [verify] $10,000-$25,000
* Return on investment (ROI) is 3-5 years (no specific data provided)
* Long-term sustainability assessments

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Specific recommendations include:

* Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research directions include economic impact assessments, community acceptance studies, and long-term sustainability evaluations.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop and implement policies supporting integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects**, including incentives for farmers and grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
2. **Invest in infrastructure development**, such as roads and storage facilities, to enhance the feasibility of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Conduct further research** on economic impact assessments, community acceptance studies, and long-term sustainability evaluations.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed solution of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution to water scarcity in lower-income countries, specifically targeting school feeding supply chains in the Great Lakes region. By addressing immediate water scarcity issues and contributing to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption, this approach supports adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.
