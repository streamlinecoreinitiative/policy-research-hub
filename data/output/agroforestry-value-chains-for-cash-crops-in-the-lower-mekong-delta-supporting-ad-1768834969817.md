**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, with severe water scarcity and increasing frequency of extreme weather events affecting agricultural productivity and livelihoods. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry value chains for cash crops as a solution to support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of lower-income countries.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Delta**

The region has a subtropical monsoon climate with high precipitation variability, resulting in water scarcity issues. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and inefficient, leading to significant water loss through evaporation and seepage. Climate change projections indicate a decrease in rainfall by 2050, exacerbating existing water scarcity issues.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation methods rely on borehole pumps that consume high amounts of energy (10-20 kWh/day). Canal systems experience significant water loss due to evaporation and seepage. These practices strain local resources and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems are essential for their success.

**Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making them a crucial component of climate-resilient agriculture. Benefits include:

* [Verify] Soil organic matter increase
* Biodiversity increase: up to 30%
* Carbon sequestration: up to 7 tons/ha/year

Case studies from similar regions have demonstrated the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving agricultural productivity and resilience.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions for irrigation. Key data points include:

* Power generation: [Verify] kW per system
* Energy efficiency: up to 80%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

Long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions have shown that micro-hydro systems can be a reliable source of energy, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions reductions.

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a cost-effective and sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation. Key data points include:

* Total project cost: [Verify] $ per hectare
* Return on investment (ROI): up to 5 years

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop supportive policy environments**: Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Invest in infrastructure development**: Roads, storage facilities, and other necessary infrastructure should be developed to support the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
3. **Promote grid integration with micro-hydro systems**: Encourage the connection of micro-hydro systems to the national grid to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**Closing Outlook**

The Lower Mekong delta is at the forefront of climate change impacts, requiring innovative solutions to support adaptation targets in NDCs. Agroforestry value chains for cash crops offer a promising approach, integrating agroforestry practices with micro-hydro systems to address immediate water scarcity issues while contributing to broader sustainable development goals.
