**Bridging Water Security Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa through Renewable Energy and Climate Resilience**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the pressing need to address water security challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa by promoting renewable energy integration and climate resilience. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), it is crucial that governments prioritize investments in renewable energy projects to meet the SDG target of 50% consumption by 2030 (Policy Recommendation 1). By implementing these strategies, we can accelerate progress towards SDG 6 goals and build resilient communities better equipped to withstand future climate shocks.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with water scarcity and limited access to electricity, posing significant health and economic challenges. The region suffers from extreme weather events and inadequate infrastructure, exacerbating existing water scarcity issues (World Bank Open Data, 2021). Only [VERIFY] % of Sub-Saharan Africa's population enjoys electricity, compared to 91.6% globally (World Bank Open Data, 2023). Renewable energy consumption is only at 19.7%, far short of the SDG target of 50% (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

## Analysis

The region faces a dual challenge—water scarcity and limited access to clean energy. Improved water security can help reduce disease transmission, while renewable energy solutions can provide sustainable power alternatives. For instance, solar-powered desalination plants could significantly increase freshwater availability in arid regions (World Bank Open Data, 2021), complemented by microgrids for remote communities.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration**: Governments should prioritize investments in renewable energy projects to meet the SDG target of 50% consumption by 2030.
2. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**: Develop and finance water purification facilities, including solar-powered desalination plants, to improve access to safe drinking water.
3. **Support Community-Based Initiatives**: Encourage local community groups to manage water resources sustainably through education and capacity-building programs.

## Implementation Considerations

- Initial costs for renewable energy projects can be substantial but are offset by long-term savings on traditional energy subsidies (World Bank Open Data, 2021).
- Microgrids require upfront capital investment but can lead to cost-effective, decentralized power solutions.
- Community engagement is crucial; local leaders must be involved in planning and implementation processes to ensure sustainability.

## Conclusion

Addressing water scarcity and energy poverty simultaneously through renewable energy investments presents a win-win scenario for Sub-Saharan Africa. By aligning these efforts with SDG 6 goals, we can build resilient communities better equipped to withstand future climate shocks. It is imperative that governments prioritize these initiatives to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
