# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, governments should prioritize investments in water infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, to increase access to safely managed drinking water (32.4% currently) [1]. Secondly, policies that incentivize the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power should be implemented, with a focus on grid modernization to support distributed renewable energy systems [2]. Lastly, climate resilience programs should be enhanced through early warning systems for climate-induced disasters and implementation of climate-resilient agricultural practices.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Despite progress, the region's population has limited access to safely managed drinking water (32.4% [1]) and electricity (53.3% [2]). These disparities threaten economic growth and exacerbate climate vulnerabilities. The Sudano-Sahelian belt, which spans across several countries in West Africa, is particularly vulnerable due to its arid climate and limited resources.

## Analysis

### Water Security

- Only 32.4% of the Sub-Saharan African population has access to safely managed drinking water [1].
- This disparity exacerbates health issues and agricultural productivity losses.
- Investing $1 billion in water infrastructure projects can provide access to safe drinking water for 3 million people [3]. **[VERIFY]**

### Clean Energy Access

- Only about 53.3% of the region’s population has access to electricity [2], significantly below global averages.
- Rural areas face particular challenges in accessing reliable power sources.

### Climate Adaptation

- Limited renewable energy consumption at just 19.7% means Sub-Saharan Africa is not adequately prepared for climate change impacts [4].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Water Infrastructure Investments**:
   - Increase funding for water supply and sanitation projects, particularly in rural areas.
   - Promote community-based management of water resources to ensure sustainable use.

2. **Accelerate Renewable Energy Deployment**:
   - Implement policies that incentivize the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
   - Invest in grid modernization to support distributed renewable energy systems.

3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Programs**:
   - Develop early warning systems for climate-induced disasters, such as droughts and floods [5].
   - Collaborate with local communities to implement climate-resilient agricultural practices.

## Implementation Considerations

- The cost of implementing these interventions varies but is generally within the range of national budgets.
- Potential barriers include insufficient funding and resistance from local populations who may be skeptical about new technologies or management systems.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is crucial for the sustainable development of Sub-Saharan Africa. By adopting evidence-based policies and practical measures, countries can significantly improve these critical areas and build more resilient communities. The next steps involve sustained political commitment and coordinated international support to realize these goals.

**Key Data Points:**

- **Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa**: 32.4 [1]
- **Access to electricity (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa**: 53.3 [2]
- **Renewable energy consumption (%) - World**: 19.7 [4]

**Additional Data Needed:**

- Detailed breakdown of current investments in water infrastructure and renewable energy.
- Success stories or case studies demonstrating effective interventions in these areas in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- Specific examples of early warning systems and climate-resilient agricultural practices that have been implemented successfully.
