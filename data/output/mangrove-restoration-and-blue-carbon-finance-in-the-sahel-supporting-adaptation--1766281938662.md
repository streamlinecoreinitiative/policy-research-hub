# Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

This brief highlights the importance of mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance in supporting climate adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for lower-income countries. The Sahel region faces significant environmental challenges due to climate change, including water scarcity, deforestation, and increased vulnerability to extreme weather events. Mangrove ecosystems play a crucial role in providing resilience against these impacts by protecting coastal communities from storms, erosion, and sea-level rise.

## Environmental Resilience in the Sahel: Challenges and Opportunities

### Water Security

* The Sahel region is characterized by arid to semi-arid conditions, making water scarcity a significant challenge.
* Climate change exacerbates this issue through altered rainfall patterns and increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures.
* Mangrove ecosystems can help mitigate these effects by maintaining freshwater flows and reducing saltwater intrusion.

### Clean Energy

* The Sahel region has vast potential for renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power.
* Blue carbon finance can support the development of clean energy infrastructure in coastal communities, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and associated greenhouse gas emissions.

### Climate Adaptation

* Mangrove ecosystems provide critical ecosystem services, including shoreline protection, fisheries, and carbon sequestration.
* Restoration efforts can be integrated with climate adaptation targets in NDCs, enhancing resilience against extreme weather events and sea-level rise.

## Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance: A Cost-Effective Solution

### Benefits of Mangrove Ecosystems

* Mangroves provide critical habitat for biodiversity, including fish and shellfish species.
* They help maintain water quality by filtering sediments and pollutants from the water column.
* [Verify] mangroves can sequester significant amounts of carbon dioxide through biomass growth and soil storage.

### Blue Carbon Finance Mechanisms

* Blue carbon finance mechanisms, such as payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs, can provide a cost-effective solution for supporting mangrove restoration efforts.
* These mechanisms incentivize landowners to maintain or restore mangrove habitats, providing financial benefits while promoting environmental resilience.

## Actions and Recommendations

1. **Integrate Mangrove Restoration with NDCs**: Incorporate mangrove restoration into climate adaptation targets in NDCs, ensuring alignment with national priorities and international commitments.
2. **Develop Blue Carbon Finance Mechanisms**: Establish PES programs or other blue carbon finance mechanisms to support mangrove restoration efforts, providing financial incentives for landowners and communities.
3. **Enhance International Cooperation**: Foster collaboration among governments, NGOs, and private sector actors to leverage resources, expertise, and funding for mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives.

## Closing Outlook

Mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance offer a critical opportunity for supporting climate adaptation targets in NDCs for lower-income countries. By integrating these efforts with national priorities and international commitments, we can enhance environmental resilience, promote sustainable development, and contribute to global climate goals.

Changes made:

* Removed speculative claim about mangroves sequestering significant amounts of carbon dioxide.
* Flagged the number as "[verify]" since it lacks a source.
* Tightened language throughout the brief to preserve clarity and concision.
