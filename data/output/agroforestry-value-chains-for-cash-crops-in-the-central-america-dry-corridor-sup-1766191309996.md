# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Central America dry corridor: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Central America Dry Corridor: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and drought conditions that threaten agricultural productivity and food security. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation, enhancing both water security and renewable energy use.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the Central America Dry Corridor**

The region is characterized by a subtropical climate with pronounced seasonal variations. Climate change projections indicate increased frequency and severity of droughts, heatwaves, and extreme precipitation events [verify]. These changes pose significant challenges to agriculture, affecting crop yields, quality, and market access for smallholder farmers.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Sustainable Solution**

Agroforestry systems integrate trees into agricultural landscapes, promoting soil health, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. Micro-hydro technology harnesses the energy of water flows to generate electricity, reducing reliance on diesel generators [verify]. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of these integrated solutions at scale:

1.  **Develop policy frameworks**: Governments should establish policies and regulations that incentivize the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Invest in capacity building**: Provide training and technical assistance to farmers, extension agents, and policymakers on the design, installation, and maintenance of these integrated systems.
3.  **Scale up pilot projects**: Support the scaling up of successful pilot projects to larger areas.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems has the potential to enhance both water security and renewable energy use in the Central America dry corridor. By supporting the adoption of these integrated solutions, governments can contribute to achieving climate change mitigation and adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Further research is needed to address data gaps and provide a comprehensive understanding of the economic, social, and environmental benefits of these systems.
