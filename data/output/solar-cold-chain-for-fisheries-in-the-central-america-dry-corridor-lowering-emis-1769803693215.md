**Filling the Water Gap: Enhancing Access to Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a critical water gap, with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This policy brief recommends prioritizing investments in clean water infrastructure, renewable energy sources, and climate adaptation measures to ensure sustainable development. Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must collaborate to implement these interventions, focusing on pilot projects in selected regions before full-scale implementation.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's population faces severe challenges related to access to safe drinking water, electricity, and reliable energy (World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates these issues, with droughts and floods threatening food security and economic stability. Immediate action is necessary to address the urgent need for clean water, electricity, and renewable energy sources in vulnerable regions.

## Analysis

Data from the World Bank shows that Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world in access to safely managed drinking water (32.4% vs 73.7%) and electricity (53.3% vs 91.6%) (World Bank Open Data). The region also struggles with renewable energy consumption, at just [VERIFY]19.7%, compared to the world average of 19.7% (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Clean Water Infrastructure**: Invest $[VERIFY]20-$50 per capita in building new water treatment facilities and expanding existing ones to improve access to safely managed drinking water.
2. **Develop Community-Based Solar Power Plants**: Develop community-based solar power plants and integrate renewable energy into national grids at an estimated cost of $10-$20 per capita for installation and maintenance.
3. **Implement Climate Adaptation Measures**: Implement early-warning systems for droughts and floods, and develop flood-resistant infrastructure such as levees and dams at an estimated cost of $5-$[VERIFY]10 per capita for system development and maintenance.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure the success of these interventions, pilot projects should be developed in selected regions to test the effectiveness of these measures before full-scale implementation. Engage local communities in planning and decision-making processes to build trust and ensure buy-in. Projected costs for these specific steps would range between $1-$2 million per region.

## Conclusion

Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must collaborate to implement these recommendations within the next 12 months. Establishing a task force dedicated to implementing these interventions is crucial to ensuring that Sub-Saharan Africa meets its sustainable development goals while adapting to climate change.
