**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Indus Watershed: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

Immediate action is required to address the triple threat of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability facing Sub-Saharan Africa. To bolster resilience in water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation, we recommend:

* Enhancing public-private partnerships to fund infrastructure development, such as rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants.
* Investing heavily in solar energy infrastructure for rural areas where access is limited.
* Supporting climate-resilient agriculture through the promotion of drought-resistant crops, improved irrigation systems, and early warning systems.

These interventions can significantly improve living standards and environmental resilience for millions of people. We must act now to ensure a sustainable future for Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a critical juncture in its development trajectory. With over 624 million people [1], the region struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), exacerbating existing challenges such as droughts, floods, and landslides [2]. Climate change intensifies these natural disasters, threatening livelihoods and infrastructure [3].

The region's limited resources amplify these challenges, necessitating urgent policy interventions to secure sustainable development. We must prioritize water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation to ensure a resilient future for Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Analysis

Evidence shows that 73.7% of the global population has access to safely managed drinking water [4], but in Sub-Saharan Africa, this drops to 32.4% [5]. The region faces a stark disparity due to inadequate funding, infrastructure breakdowns, and unreliable energy supply.

Renewable energy consumption in the world stands at 19.7%, with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind at 9.2% [6]. This underutilization not only hinders economic growth but also exacerbates climate change impacts such as droughts and floods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security:**
	* Strengthen public-private partnerships to fund and implement water projects, including rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants in arid regions.
	* Invest in infrastructure development to improve access to safe drinking water for vulnerable communities.
2. **Clean Energy:**
	* Invest heavily in solar energy infrastructure, particularly for rural areas where access is limited.
	* Implement policies that mandate renewable energy targets and subsidies for clean energy adoption.
3. **Climate Adaptation:**
	* Support climate-resilient agriculture through the promotion of drought-resistant crops, improved irrigation systems, and early warning systems to mitigate natural disasters.

## Implementation Considerations

Specific actions should be tailored to local contexts, ensuring they are feasible within existing budgets and institutional frameworks. Potential barriers include resistance from traditional power sources, lack of skilled labor, and insufficient funding for large-scale projects [7]. Address these challenges through targeted training programs and innovative financing mechanisms.

## Conclusion

To build a sustainable future in Sub-Saharan Africa requires immediate action on water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation. By implementing the recommended policies and addressing identified barriers, decision-makers can significantly improve living standards and environmental resilience for millions of people.
