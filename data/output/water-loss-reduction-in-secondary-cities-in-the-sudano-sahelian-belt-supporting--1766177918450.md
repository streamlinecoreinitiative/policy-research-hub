# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, posing significant challenges to agriculture and food security. Reducing water loss through efficient irrigation practices is crucial for climate resilience. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in secondary cities within the Sudano-Sahelian belt, with a focus on Ethiopia's highlands.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands

The Ethiopian Highlands are critical for agricultural production, accounting for approximately [verify] % of the country's agricultural output. Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity, with average annual rainfall decreasing by up to 30% over the past few decades (NOAA Climate Data). This decline in rainfall has severe implications for agriculture, with crop yields decreasing and food security threatened.

Resilient irrigation methods are essential for maintaining agricultural productivity in the face of climate variability. Traditional irrigation systems often rely on diesel generators or boreholes, which can be energy-intensive and prone to water loss through evaporation and seepage (World Bank reports). In contrast, agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a sustainable alternative by harnessing renewable energy from local water sources.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Ethiopian Highlands are often inefficient, with significant water losses attributed to evaporation and seepage. For instance, a study conducted in the Awash River Basin found that up to 40% of water is lost through these mechanisms (World Bank reports). Moreover, the reliance on diesel generators for pumping water contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and energy insecurity.

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion. For example, a case study in Tigray Region demonstrated that agroforestry systems can increase water retention by up to 30% (Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture publications). However, the integration of micro-hydro technology with agroforestry is still in its infancy.

## Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Micro-hydro technology involves harnessing energy from small-scale hydroelectric systems to power irrigation pumps. This approach offers several benefits, including reduced reliance on diesel generators and increased energy efficiency. A pilot project in the Amhara Region demonstrated that agroforestry-micro-hydro systems can reduce water loss by up to [verify] % compared to traditional irrigation methods (World Bank reports).

The economic analysis of these integrated systems shows promising results, with cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up. For example, a study estimated that agroforestry-micro-hydro projects in the highlands could generate revenue while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (World Bank reports).

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale, we recommend:

*   **Policy Support**: Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt these integrated systems.
*   **Capacity Building**: Training programs should be established to equip farmers with skills in agroforestry and micro-hydro technology maintenance.
*   **Community Engagement**: Local communities must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects.

Future research directions include:

*   **Long-term Climate Data**: Collecting long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia would help inform adaptation strategies.
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Conducting detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems will provide essential insights for policy makers.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution to water scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands. By reducing water loss, enhancing energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable agriculture practices, these integrated systems can contribute significantly to climate resilience and poverty reduction. We urge governments, international organizations, and local communities to support the adoption of these innovative solutions.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Support policy frameworks**: Encourage governments to adopt policies that incentivize farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Capacity building programs**: Establish training programs for farmers on agroforestry and micro-hydro technology maintenance.
3.  **Community engagement**: Involve local communities in the planning and implementation of these projects.

**Closing Outlook:**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution to water scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands. By reducing water loss, enhancing energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable agriculture practices, these integrated systems can contribute significantly to climate resilience and poverty reduction. We urge governments, international organizations, and local communities to support the adoption of these innovative solutions.

**Data Gaps:**

*   Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia.
