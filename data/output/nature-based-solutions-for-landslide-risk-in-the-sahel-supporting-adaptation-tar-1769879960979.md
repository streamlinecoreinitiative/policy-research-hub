**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. Despite substantial progress globally, these issues remain acute within the region. To address this, we recommend investing in renewable energy sources to increase electricity access (currently at 53.3% of the population), implementing watershed co-management programs involving indigenous communities to enhance water security, and promoting agroforestry value chains for climate resilience.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is the least electrified region globally, with only [VERIFY] % of its population having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). This lack of energy access severely hampers economic development and exacerbates poverty. Furthermore, water challenges are equally pressing: only [VERIFY] % of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, leaving millions without reliable sources (World Bank, 2024).

Climate change is a critical driver affecting both sectors: increased frequency of droughts and floods impacts water availability and quality, while rising temperatures affect agricultural productivity and energy demand. The region's vulnerability to climate-related disasters is evident in the Sahel, where landslides pose significant risks to communities and infrastructure.

### Analysis

Evidence shows that Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in both energy and water security metrics compared to the global average. Renewable energy consumption stands at only [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption (World Bank, 2021), significantly below the world's [VERIFY] %. Climate change is a critical driver affecting both sectors: increased frequency of droughts and floods impacts water availability and quality, while rising temperatures affect agricultural productivity and energy demand.

### Policy Recommendations

We recommend the following interventions to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa:

1.  **Invest in Renewable Energy**: Expand renewable energy projects to increase access to electricity. For instance, solar-powered mini-grids can provide sustainable power solutions for remote communities.
    *   Initial investment costs: $100 million - $500 million per project
    *   Project duration: 5-10 years
2.  **Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Communities**: Engage local indigenous councils in managing water resources and implementing climate-resilient practices such as agroforestry value chains.
    *   Collaboration mechanism: Establish partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector partners to support co-management initiatives.
3.  **Promote Agroforestry Value Chains**: Support smallholder farmers transitioning to more resilient agricultural systems that enhance soil health, biodiversity, and water management.
    *   Technical assistance: Provide training and capacity-building programs for smallholder farmers on agroforestry practices.

### Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in renewable energy projects can be substantial but yield long-term savings through reduced dependency on fossil fuels and increased energy security. Collaborative efforts between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector partners can help overcome challenges such as limited funding, lack of skilled personnel, and resistance from traditional power structures.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience remain critical gaps in development. By implementing targeted interventions like renewable energy projects, watershed co-management with indigenous communities, and agroforestry value chains, the region can significantly improve its sustainability trajectory while fostering inclusive growth.
