**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in West Africa: Strengthening Resilient Societies**

## Executive Summary

West African countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and renewable energy. To address this critical issue, we recommend that policymakers implement targeted policies focusing on improving water security through infrastructure development, expanding clean energy access, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

Specifically, we propose investing $10 billion over the next 5 years to rehabilitate boreholes, improve sanitation facilities, and promote rainwater harvesting systems. This investment will ensure that at least [VERIFY] % of the population in West Africa has access to safely managed drinking water by 2030.

## Context & Challenge

West African countries are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods (IPCC, 2022). Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world in terms of accessing safe drinking water, with only [32.4%] (World Bank Open Data, 2024) of the population having access to safely managed drinking water compared to [73.7%] globally (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This exacerbates health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.

The region's reliance on traditional water sources like boreholes and rivers, coupled with inadequate sanitation facilities, leads to high rates of waterborne diseases (WHO/UNICEF, 2019). Moreover, only [53.3%] (World Bank Open Data, 2023) of Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, limiting the ability to harness renewable energy for climate adaptation.

## Analysis

The evidence suggests that addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for ensuring food security, public health, and economic stability in West Africa. Climate impacts such as increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events threaten agricultural productivity, water availability, and public health infrastructure (IPCC, 2022).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Invest [NEEDS SOURCE] over the next 3 years to rehabilitate boreholes, improve sanitation facilities, and promote rainwater harvesting systems.
	* Implement a community-led approach to identify areas of need and develop targeted interventions.
	* Collaborate with local governments and NGOs to ensure sustainable management and maintenance of water infrastructure.
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Access**: Invest [NEEDS SOURCE] over the next 5 years to increase solar power installations and develop small-scale hydropower projects.
	* Develop a regional energy plan to meet electricity demands while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
	* Provide training and capacity-building programs for local communities to manage and maintain renewable energy systems.
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Invest [NEEDS SOURCE] over the next 5 years to implement early warning systems for climate-related disasters, build flood-resilient infrastructure, and support agroforestry value chains.

## Implementation Considerations

* Costs: Estimated investment of $10 billion over 5 years to achieve these goals.
* Potential barriers: Limited funding, technical expertise, and community participation in planning and implementation processes.
* Solutions: Mobilize public-private partnerships, leverage international development assistance, and engage local communities in decision-making processes.

## Conclusion

To build resilient societies in West Africa, policymakers must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. By doing so, they can mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and improve the well-being of their populations now and into the future. We urge stakeholders to take immediate action to address these critical challenges and ensure a sustainable future for West African communities.
