# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Improving Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Comprehensive Approach**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief outlines a comprehensive approach to improve water security, enhance clean energy access, and build climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our primary recommendation is to invest in micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk, which can lower emissions from critical sectors by promoting sustainable agricultural practices and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. Recent data show that 32.4% of people have access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)] and only 53.3% have access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)]. Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data (2020)], with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, including increasing frequency of droughts and floods.

## Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's water security is severely compromised due to inadequate infrastructure and management practices. Only 73.7% of the world population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this figure drops significantly to 32.4%, highlighting a stark disparity in access across different regions. The region's reliance on renewable energy sources is also minimal.

Climate change further compounds these challenges by increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. These environmental shifts have led to water scarcity, exacerbated food insecurity, and disrupted agricultural productivity [Source: IPCC (2018)]. The lack of reliable clean energy sources in Sub-Saharan Africa exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, particularly for vulnerable populations who rely on traditional biomass fuels for cooking and heating.

## Policy Recommendations

To address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience, we recommend the following:

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Invest in sustainable water management practices such as rainwater harvesting systems, groundwater recharge projects, and community-based irrigation schemes.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Access**: Increase access to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power by incentivizing private sector investment with subsidies, tax breaks, and grants.
3. **Build Climate Resilience**: Strengthen early warning systems to better predict climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a multi-faceted approach involving collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and the private sector. Key steps include:

* Establish dedicated funds for water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience projects through partnerships with international donors and domestic financing mechanisms.
* Train local communities and professionals in sustainable water management techniques, renewable energy technologies, and climate adaptation strategies to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Conclusion

Improving water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for sustainable development. By adopting a comprehensive approach that includes enhanced infrastructure, renewable energy deployment, and climate adaptation measures, governments can significantly improve the lives of millions of people while contributing to broader global goals.

**Next Steps**: Encourage continued research into effective interventions and best practices in water management, clean energy access, and climate resilience. Advocate for increased international support through partnerships with donor countries and regional organizations.
