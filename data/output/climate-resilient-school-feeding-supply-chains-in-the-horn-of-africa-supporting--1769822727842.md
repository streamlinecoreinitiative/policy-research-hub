**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a triple challenge of water scarcity, electricity shortages, and increasing climate vulnerability. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies tailored for the region. Specifically, governments and development partners should:

* Invest $[VERIFY] billion in rainwater harvesting systems and small-scale desalination plants to expand access to safe drinking water.
* Implement feed-in tariffs and subsidies for solar, wind, and hydro projects to promote renewable energy integration.
* Build flood defenses and levees in high-risk areas to enhance climate resilience infrastructure.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, suffering from limited access to freshwater resources. Only 32.4% of its population has safe drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank Open Data, 2024). The region's current energy landscape relies heavily on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to carbon emissions and environmental degradation.

Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing variability in rainfall and temperatures. In the Horn of Africa, droughts and famines have become more frequent, threatening food security and human well-being (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe health risks from contaminated sources like surface water and groundwater. With only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water, the region struggles to meet basic human needs (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Investing in rainwater harvesting systems and small-scale desalination plants can help address this issue.

### Clean Energy

Despite a global renewable energy consumption rate of 19.7%, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with just 53.3% electricity access (World Bank Open Data, 2023). This disparity impacts economic productivity and exacerbates poverty. Implementing feed-in tariffs and subsidies for solar, wind, and hydro projects can promote renewable energy integration.

### Climate Adaptation

Increased frequency of droughts, floods, and extreme weather events threatens agricultural yields and water resources. Enhancing climate resilience infrastructure through flood defenses and levees in high-risk areas is crucial to mitigate the impact of these events.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
	* Invest $[VERIFY] billion in rainwater harvesting systems and small-scale desalination plants.
	* Support community-led initiatives for hand-dug wells and boreholes using appropriate technology.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration**:
	* Implement feed-in tariffs and subsidies for solar, wind, and hydro projects.
	* Develop off-grid renewable energy solutions suitable for rural areas.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Infrastructure**:
	* Build flood defenses and levees in high-risk areas.
	* Invest in early warning systems to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimated investments range from $2 billion for water security projects to $[VERIFY] billion for renewable energy integration. Access to concessional financing is crucial to address these challenges. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and the private sector is essential to overcome limited technical expertise, inadequate governance structures, and funding constraints.

## Conclusion

By integrating water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies, Sub-Saharan Africa can achieve sustainable development while mitigating climate impacts. Immediate action is needed to address existing gaps and lay a foundation for long-term resilience. We urge governments and development partners to prioritize these recommendations and invest in the region's future.
