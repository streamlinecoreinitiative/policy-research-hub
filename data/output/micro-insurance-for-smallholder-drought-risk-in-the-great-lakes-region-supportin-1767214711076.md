**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

Executive Summary:

The Great Lakes region is highly vulnerable to drought, posing significant risks to smallholder farmers and their livelihoods. Climate change exacerbates these risks, making it essential to develop innovative solutions that support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This brief explores the potential of micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk management.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Great Lakes Region**

The Great Lakes region is characterized by high water scarcity due to climate change impacts on precipitation patterns. Agriculture is a significant contributor to the regional economy, but it is also heavily reliant on rainfall. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable to drought, as they often lack access to insurance and other risk management tools.

* Climate change projections indicate increased frequency and severity of droughts in the region [verify].
* Water scarcity affects not only agriculture but also human consumption, industry, and ecosystems.
* Smallholder farmers face significant economic losses due to drought-related crop failures.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Great Lakes region are often inefficient and prone to water loss. Boreholes and canals are common methods of irrigation, but they result in significant water waste through evaporation and seepage.

* Water loss percentages from existing irrigation systems: [verify] (evaporation) and [verify] (seepage)
* Inefficient irrigation practices exacerbate water scarcity and increase energy consumption.
* Smallholder farmers often lack access to modern irrigation technologies, making them more vulnerable to drought.

**Section 3: Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offer promising solutions for climate-resilient irrigation in the Great Lakes region. These approaches not only improve water retention but also provide economic benefits through increased energy efficiency and reduced reliance on diesel generators.

* Benefits of agroforestry:
	+ Soil health improvement
	+ Biodiversity enhancement
	+ Carbon sequestration
* Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry improves water retention and reduces erosion.
* Micro-hydro systems offer significant energy savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

**Section 4: Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk, policy recommendations include:

* Developing and implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices
* Investing in micro-hydro and agroforestry infrastructure
* Providing training and capacity-building programs for farmers on micro-insurance and climate-resilient agriculture

Future research directions should focus on:

* Economic impact analysis of micro-insurance on smallholder farmers
* Community engagement and participation in micro-insurance design
* Scaling up micro-hydro and agroforestry systems

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Develop climate-resilient agricultural practices and policies that support adaptation targets in NDCs.
2. Invest in micro-hydro and agroforestry infrastructure to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water waste.
3. Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers on micro-insurance and climate-resilient agriculture.

**Closing Outlook:**

The Great Lakes region faces significant challenges related to drought and water scarcity. Micro-insurance offers a promising solution for smallholder farmers, providing financial protection against drought-related losses. By investing in climate-resilient agriculture and infrastructure, we can support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs and build more resilient communities.
