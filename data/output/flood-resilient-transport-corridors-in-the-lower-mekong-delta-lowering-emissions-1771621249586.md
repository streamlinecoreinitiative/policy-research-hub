# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Lower Mekong delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in flood-resilient transport corridors as a critical sector. This policy brief highlights the urgency of addressing these gaps, which are essential for sustainable development and inclusive economic growth.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, electricity, and renewable energy. According to World Bank data (2024), only 32.4% of the region's population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], while 53.3% lacks reliable access to electricity [2]. Furthermore, less than 19.7% of total final energy consumption is from renewable sources in Sub-Saharan Africa [3]. These statistics underscore the urgent need for policy interventions aimed at improving water security and promoting sustainable energy solutions.

### Analysis

The current situation highlights significant disparities in access to safe drinking water and electricity across Sub-Saharan Africa. The data indicates that only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, which is far below global averages (73.7%) [1]. Similarly, just 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity, compared to 91.6% globally [2]. These figures are exacerbated by regional disparities; for example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 48% of urban areas have access to safely managed drinking water versus 27% in rural areas (World Bank, 2024).

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges effectively, we propose the following actionable policy recommendations:

1. **Enhance Water Security**: Invest in infrastructure projects such as improved water supply systems and sanitation facilities. Prioritize community-led initiatives that involve local stakeholders, including women's groups, to ensure sustainable management [Source: UN-Water/WHO]. Additionally, support the implementation of rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge projects to enhance resilience against climate variability.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**: Encourage the deployment of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro. Provide subsidies for households and businesses to adopt these technologies, especially in rural areas where access is most critical [Source: IEA World Energy Outlook 2023]. Establish robust regulatory frameworks that ensure fair distribution of benefits from renewable projects.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Implement early-warning systems and disaster preparedness plans. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure such as flood barriers, water storage facilities, and irrigation systems. Conduct regular climate risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and prioritize interventions accordingly [Source: IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 2007].

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning and coordination among various stakeholders including governments, NGOs, and the private sector. Key considerations include securing adequate funding through grants, public-private partnerships, and innovative financing mechanisms such as green bonds.

### Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted efforts from all sectors. By implementing these policy recommendations and addressing potential barriers through robust planning and stakeholder engagement, we can accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 6 (water), SDG 7 (energy), and SDG 13 (climate action).
