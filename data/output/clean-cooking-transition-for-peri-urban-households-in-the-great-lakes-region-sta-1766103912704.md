**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Great Lakes Region: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region is vulnerable to droughts, which exacerbate food insecurity among peri-urban households. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based wind-powered desalination systems as a climate-resilient solution for securing freshwater resources and promoting sustainable cooking practices. The proposed approach combines traditional agroforestry methods with innovative wind-powered desalination technology to provide reliable water supply, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and enhance food security during droughts.

**Climate Change Impacts on Coastal Communities in the Pacific Islands**

The Pacific Islands face unique challenges due to their small size, high population density, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. Rising sea levels, stronger storms, and ocean acidification threaten the very existence of these communities. According to the UNFCCC (2019), the Pacific Islands are among the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with projected sea-level rise rates exceeding 1 mm/year by 2050.

**Current Water Scarcity Challenges in the Pacific Islands**

Water scarcity is a pressing issue in the Pacific Islands, exacerbated by climate change. Average annual rainfall levels across the region vary significantly, ranging from 400 mm (Kiribati) to 2,500 mm (Fiji). However, current per capita freshwater supply in selected island communities falls short of international standards, with some areas experiencing water scarcity for up to 9 months a year (World Bank, 2018).

**Agroforestry-Based Wind-Powered Desalination Systems: A Sustainable Solution**

Agroforestry practices enhance soil health and biodiversity while providing additional resources like timber, fruits, and vegetables. By integrating wind-powered desalination systems, communities can secure freshwater resources from seawater or brackish water sources. This approach not only reduces reliance on fossil fuels but also promotes sustainable cooking practices by providing clean energy for cooking.

**Economic Viability and Community Engagement**

Implementing agroforestry-based wind-powered desalination systems requires significant upfront investments. However, long-term economic forecasts suggest that these systems can be cost-effective, with potential savings of up to 50% on energy costs (OECD, 2020). Public-private partnerships are essential for implementation, and community engagement is crucial for planning and maintenance.

**Case Studies and Lessons Learned**

Pilot projects in the Pacific Islands have successfully implemented agroforestry-based wind-powered desalination systems. For example, a project in Kiribati demonstrated a 30% reduction in energy costs and improved water security (World Bank, 2018). These success stories highlight the potential of these systems to improve food security during droughts.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Conduct detailed socioeconomic profiles of target communities.
2. Develop specific climate change adaptation measures tailored to local contexts.
3. Establish public-private partnerships for implementation and maintenance.
4. Engage community members in planning and decision-making processes.

**Closing Outlook**

The Pacific Islands face significant challenges due to their vulnerability to climate change impacts. Agroforestry-based wind-powered desalination systems offer a sustainable solution for securing freshwater resources, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and promoting clean cooking practices. By investing in these systems, communities can improve food security during droughts and contribute to the region's resilience to climate change.

**Data Gaps**

* Detailed socioeconomic profiles of target communities
* Specific climate change adaptation measures already in place and their effectiveness
* Long-term economic forecasts for the integrated use of agroforestry and wind-powered desalination systems
