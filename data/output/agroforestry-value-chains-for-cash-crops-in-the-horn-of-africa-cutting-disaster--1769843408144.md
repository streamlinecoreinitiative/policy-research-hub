**Bridging Water Security Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa Through Renewable Energy and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security and clean energy challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) and 53.3% have access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023). To bridge these gaps, we recommend investing in solar-powered water wells in rural areas, expanding large-scale renewable energy projects, and developing climate-resilient water management systems.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity. According to World Bank data (2024), the region has the lowest access to safely managed drinking water globally, at 32.4%. This is drastically lower than the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Moreover, only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, compared to a global average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

Climate change exacerbates these challenges, with droughts and floods becoming more frequent and severe. Without substantial improvements, Sub-Saharan Africa will struggle to meet its commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to water security (SDG 6) and renewable energy (SDG 7). The global population lacking safe water is estimated at 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Access to safely managed drinking water is an essential component of sustainable development. Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind other regions with only 32.4% access (World Bank Open Data, 2024).
- **Clean Energy**: The region's renewable energy consumption stands at just [VERIFY]%, significantly below global averages and necessary for meeting climate targets and fostering resilience against extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Costs**: Initial investments in renewable energy projects and water infrastructure can be substantial but will yield long-term benefits in terms of reduced energy costs and improved health outcomes.
2. **Barriers**: Political resistance, lack of funding, and inadequate institutional capacity may hinder implementation.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and clean energy challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa is critical for sustainable development and climate resilience. By investing in renewable energy projects and developing resilient water management systems, the region can improve access to safe drinking water and reliable electricity, thereby enhancing livelihoods and reducing vulnerability to climate change impacts.
