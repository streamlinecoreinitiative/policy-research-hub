**Filling the Water Gap: Enhancing Access to Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Immediate action is needed to address the severe water scarcity challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). By prioritizing investments in clean energy projects, particularly solar power, we can significantly improve access to safe drinking water and ensure continuous electricity supply. Implementing climate-resilient water management practices like watershed co-management with indigenous councils is also crucial for building communities' resilience against climate-related shocks.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change impacts, including erratic rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts (World Bank Open Data). These conditions exacerbate existing water scarcity issues, severely hampering economic development and public health outcomes. The region's limited access to clean energy and safe drinking water makes immediate interventions critical for sustainable growth.

## Analysis

Despite significant progress in renewable energy adoption globally (19.7% of total final energy from renewables in 2020), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only [VERIFY] % of electricity access from renewables (World Bank Open Data). This disparity underscores a need to accelerate clean energy projects and improve water security.

* Access to safely managed drinking water: 32.4% (Sub-Saharan Africa, 2024) [1]
* Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy): 16.4% (Sub-Saharan Africa, 2021) [2]
* Population lacking safe water: Over [VERIFY] million people (2022) [3]

## Policy Recommendations

We recommend the following specific, actionable steps for decision-makers:

1. **Invest in clean energy projects**: Allocate funds to develop and deploy solar power systems in rural areas. Solar-powered desalination plants can provide clean drinking water solutions.
2. **Promote climate-resilient water management practices**: Collaborate with indigenous councils to implement watershed co-management strategies that enhance natural water resources and protect against future climatic changes.

## Implementation Considerations

* Estimated cost for solar-powered wells: [NEEDS SOURCE]
* Potential barriers include initial investment costs, technical expertise required, and community buy-in. Local governments can facilitate project implementation through grants and subsidies.

## Conclusion

Immediate action is needed to bridge the gaps in clean energy access and water security in Sub-Saharan Africa. By prioritizing investments in renewable energy projects and climate-resilient water management practices, we can significantly enhance the region's resilience against future climatic challenges.

**Recommendation**: Invest $100 million in solar-powered desalination plants and watershed co-management initiatives over the next two years to improve access to safe drinking water and reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups.
