**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Horn of Africa: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity while coping with the impacts of climate change. This region is home to nearly 60% of the world's poorest countries and has seen limited progress in meeting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets for access to clean water and renewable energy. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in clean energy infrastructure and sustainable water management solutions to enhance resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the least developed regions globally, with limited access to basic utilities. Climate variability has exacerbated existing disparities, making it harder for communities to adapt. According to World Bank data [1], access to safely managed drinking water is only 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to 73.7% globally [2]. Similarly, renewable energy consumption has reached 19.7% globally, but this needs to be scaled up for Sub-Saharan Africa [3].

Immediate action is needed to improve water security and energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa, where climate change impacts are expected to intensify. The region faces significant challenges in meeting SDG 6 (clean water) and SDG 7 (renewable energy). Despite some progress, the gap remains substantial.

## Analysis

The region's limited access to clean water and renewable energy is exacerbated by climate variability, leading to more frequent droughts and floods. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa has seen a decrease in freshwater withdrawal [4]. This highlights the urgent need for investment in sustainable water management solutions.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy Infrastructure**:
	* Develop and implement large-scale solar, wind, and hydro projects to increase access to clean energy.
	* The World Bank reports that renewable energy consumption has reached 19.7% globally, but this needs to be scaled up for Sub-Saharan Africa [3].
2. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Implement water harvesting systems and improve wastewater management in urban areas.
	* Access to safely managed drinking water is only 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to 73.7% globally [1].

## Implementation Considerations

Developing clear funding mechanisms and collaboration frameworks between governments, NGOs, and international organizations will be crucial for implementation. Potential barriers include high initial costs, technical expertise gaps, and political resistance.

## Conclusion

Urgent investment in renewable energy infrastructure and water security measures is essential for building resilience against climate change impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa. Governments should lead the charge by setting clear targets, while international partners must provide financial support and technical assistance. NGOs can play a crucial role in implementation and monitoring progress.
