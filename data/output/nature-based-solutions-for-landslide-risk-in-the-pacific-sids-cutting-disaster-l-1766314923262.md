# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Pacific SIDS: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in Pacific Small Island Developing States: A Sustainable Approach to Disaster Loss Reduction**

**Executive Summary**

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including landslides, which pose significant threats to human lives, infrastructure, and economic stability. Climate change exacerbates these risks through increased rainfall intensity and frequency, leading to soil erosion and landslide events. This brief proposes nature-based solutions as a cost-effective and sustainable approach to reducing landslide risk in Pacific SIDS.

**Section 1: Introduction to Landslide Risk in the Pacific SIDS**

The Pacific SIDS are characterized by steep terrain, high population density, and limited resources, making them particularly susceptible to landslides. Climate change is projected to increase rainfall intensity and frequency in these regions (NOAA climate dataset). The economic impact of landslides in the Pacific SIDS is substantial, with significant disaster losses reported (World Bank Report: "Access to Electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa").

**Section 2: Current Landslide Risk Management Practices and Challenges**

Existing landslide risk management practices in the Pacific SIDS often rely on traditional methods, such as manual clearing and excavation. However, these approaches are often ineffective and unsustainable due to limited resources and expertise (Mexican Ministry of Agriculture Publication: "Agroforestry Practices and Their Impact on Water Management"). Current practices frequently overlook the importance of integrating nature-based solutions into landslide risk management strategies.

**Section 3: Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk Reduction**

This brief proposes the integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a nature-based solution to reduce landslide risk in Pacific SIDS. Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, increase water retention, and reduce erosion (Case studies from the Mesoamerican Highlands). Micro-hydro systems can provide clean energy for irrigation and other essential services.

**Section 4: Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of nature-based solutions in Pacific SIDS, we recommend:

* Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems into national disaster risk reduction strategies
* Providing technical assistance and capacity-building programs for local communities and authorities
* Conducting further research on the economic impact and community benefits of these integrated solutions

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop a regional framework** for integrating nature-based solutions into landslide risk management strategies.
2. **Establish a knowledge-sharing platform** to facilitate exchange of best practices and lessons learned among Pacific SIDS.
3. **Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs** to support local communities and authorities in implementing nature-based solutions.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising approach to reducing landslide risk in Pacific SIDS. By adopting these nature-based solutions, we can contribute to sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption.
