# Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Indus Watershed: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to water security and food production in lower-income countries, particularly in regions like the Indus watershed. This brief explores the potential of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a solution to support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, communities can enhance water security and renewable energy use while promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Indus Watershed

The Indus watershed is a critical agricultural region facing severe water scarcity due to climate change. Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from its vast wetlands exacerbate existing challenges for smallholder farmers, who are vulnerable to droughts. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, further straining economic resources.

## Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives: A Solution

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution by integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. Agroforestry practices improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while enhancing water retention and reducing erosion. Micro-hydro systems provide efficient energy generation for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators.

### Key Benefits of Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives

*   Improved water security through enhanced water retention and reduced evaporation
*   Increased renewable energy use through micro-hydro systems
*   Promoting sustainable agriculture practices through agroforestry
*   Enhanced economic stability for smallholder farmers through cost-effective irrigation solutions

## Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives can support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs by:

1.  Enhancing water security and reducing vulnerability to droughts
2.  Promoting sustainable agriculture practices and improving soil health
3.  Increasing renewable energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4.  Supporting economic stability for smallholder farmers through cost-effective irrigation solutions

## Actions/Recommendations

To support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, we recommend:

1.  Conducting further research on the economic impact and community acceptance of these integrated solutions
2.  Developing policy frameworks to support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives at scale
3.  Providing technical assistance and capacity-building programs for smallholder farmers and communities

## Closing Outlook

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution to address water scarcity and promote sustainable agriculture practices in lower-income countries like those in the Indus watershed. By supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs, these integrated solutions can contribute to achieving global climate goals while enhancing economic stability for smallholder farmers.
