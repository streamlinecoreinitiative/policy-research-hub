# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Indus watershed: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in lower-income countries, we recommend prioritizing investments in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries in the Indus watershed. This initiative can improve health outcomes during heatwaves by reducing fish spoilage and ensuring a steady supply of safe food to vulnerable populations.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water ([1] World Bank Open Data) and electricity ([2] World Bank Open Data). Renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7% globally ([3] World Bank Open Data), highlighting substantial room for improvement in this sector. Climate change is further exacerbating these challenges by intensifying droughts, floods, and extreme weather events.

## Analysis

The statistics underscore the urgent need to address water scarcity and energy poverty through targeted interventions. For instance, a 2024 UN-Water/WHO report noted that approximately [VERIFY] people globally lack access to safe drinking water ([4] UN-Water/WHO), exacerbating health risks in already disadvantaged communities.

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience, we propose the following:

1. **Solar-Powered Cold-Chain Systems**: Invest in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries in the Indus watershed to reduce fish spoilage and ensure a steady supply of safe food to vulnerable populations.
2. **Water Security**: Increase public funding for rainwater harvesting systems, borehole drilling, and desalination plants. Implement community-led watershed management programs to improve groundwater recharge.
3. **Clean Energy Access**: Encourage solar power initiatives through grants, tax incentives, and feed-in tariffs. Support small-scale renewable energy projects in rural areas where grid extension is impractical or costly.
4. **Climate Adaptation**: Promote climate-smart agriculture practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties, irrigation efficiency improvements, and early warning systems for extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires strategic planning, coordination among various stakeholders, and adequate financial resources. Key considerations include:

* **Costs**: Estimate initial investment requirements for infrastructure projects and ongoing operational costs for clean energy initiatives.
* **Barriers**: Address potential barriers such as high upfront costs, technical expertise gaps, and limited institutional capacity.

## Conclusion

By prioritizing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, lower-income countries can build more resilient communities that are better equipped to withstand future shocks. Stakeholders must collaborate closely to ensure effective implementation of these recommendations, thereby advancing sustainable development goals in the region.
