# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Mekong basin: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Strengthening Environmental Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa Through Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. To address these challenges, we recommend enhancing public-private partnerships for a clean cooking transition to improve health outcomes in heatwaves. This can be achieved through collaborations with private sector firms and international donors to provide subsidies, loans, and technology transfer for clean cooking solutions like solar cookers, biogas stoves, and electric induction stoves (World Bank Data). By implementing this policy, we can create resilient communities capable of sustaining development amidst environmental stressors.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest continent with limited access to essential services. Only 32.4% of its population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank Open Data). Electricity access stands at 53.3%, lagging behind at 91.6% worldwide (World Bank Open Data). The region struggles with climate resilience and faces frequent droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events that threaten water security and energy production.

## Analysis

Evidence shows that Sub-Saharan Africa's inadequate access to clean cooking fuels affects health outcomes, particularly in heatwaves where air pollution from traditional stoves contributes significantly to respiratory issues (World Bank Data). Similarly, climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are crucial for maintaining education continuity during natural disasters. Early warning systems and last-mile alerts remain underdeveloped, limiting the region's ability to adapt to climate change. This is evident in NDCs where progress towards adaptation targets is slow due to resource constraints (UN SDG Report 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Public-Private Partnerships for Clean Cooking Transition**: Collaborate with private sector firms and international donors to provide subsidies, loans, and technology transfer for clean cooking solutions like solar cookers, biogas stoves, and electric induction stoves (World Bank Data).
2. **Implement Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains**: Integrate climate-resilient crops into school meal programs, ensuring food security during droughts and floods. Partner with local farmers to provide fresh produce and establish community-based storage facilities (UN-Water/WHO).
3. **Develop Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors**: Invest in flood-resistant infrastructure such as levees, drainage systems, and resilient road networks to maintain transportation routes throughout the year. Collaborate with local communities for sustainable design and maintenance (NOAA Climate).

## Implementation Considerations

1. Cost Estimates: Clean cooking transition could cost [VERIFY] million annually, while climate-resilient school feeding supply chains would require [VERIFY] million per year. Flood-resistant transport corridors might need [VERIFY] million.
2. Potential Barriers: Political resistance to public-private partnerships and funding constraints are significant barriers to implementation.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a multi-faceted approach that leverages both international support and local ingenuity. By implementing the recommended policies, we can create resilient communities capable of sustaining development amidst environmental stressors.
