# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Mekong basin: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Pathway to Resilience**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in community-based watershed co-management initiatives with indigenous councils. These efforts can be replicated across the region, leveraging local knowledge and traditional practices to enhance resilience. Specifically, we propose a $10 million investment over three years to establish a regional program for watershed co-management in five pilot countries. This initiative will not only improve water security but also promote renewable energy adoption and climate adaptation.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), while electricity access is at 53.3% (World Bank, 2023). Renewable energy consumption stands at just [VERIFY] 19.7% globally and even lower in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2020). These challenges not only impact human health but also hinder economic development and social stability.

### Analysis

- **Water Security**: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), which is a far cry from the global average of [VERIFY] 73.7% (World Bank, 2024). Water scarcity leads to health risks such as diarrhea and cholera outbreaks.
- **Clean Energy**: Electricity access remains low at 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2023), with only a [VERIFY] 19.7% share of total final energy consumption coming from renewable sources (World Bank, 2020). This disparity exacerbates economic disparities and limits development opportunities.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts such as erratic rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, and increased frequency of extreme weather events threaten agricultural productivity, water resources, and food security in the region (IPCC, 2019).

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Community-Based Watershed Co-Management Initiatives**:
	* Establish a regional program for watershed co-management with indigenous councils in five pilot countries.
	* Provide training and capacity-building for local communities on sustainable water management practices.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**:
	* Encourage the installation of solar-powered mini-grids in rural areas to reduce energy poverty.
	* Support public-private partnerships to finance off-grid solar solutions.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Capacity**:
	* Implement early warning systems for climate-related disasters using low-cost technology such as weather radios.
	* Develop local adaptation plans that integrate traditional knowledge with modern climate science.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Mobilize public and private sector investments through grants, concessional loans, and low-interest financing mechanisms.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local communities and government officials on sustainable water management practices, renewable energy technologies, and climate adaptation strategies.
- **Policy Frameworks**: Develop supportive policies that incentivize private sector involvement in clean energy projects.

### Conclusion

Enhancing water security, promoting clean energy access, and building climate resilience are critical steps toward achieving sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing the recommended policy interventions, governments and stakeholders can create a more resilient future for their populations. The proposed regional program for watershed co-management with indigenous councils offers a promising pathway to address these challenges.
