**Bridging Water Security Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa Through Renewable Energy and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

Immediate action is needed to address the water security challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). To bridge this gap, we recommend prioritizing renewable energy projects to boost electricity access and support climate adaptation efforts.

* Invest in solar-powered mini-grids to provide reliable electricity for rural clinics.
* Support wind and hydro projects to supplement grid power, ensuring continuous operation during droughts or other disruptions.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is plagued by water scarcity, with limited clean drinking water supplies exacerbating health issues (World Bank Open Data). The region lags behind in electricity access, affecting economic development and daily life. Climate change intensifies weather extremities, further straining already fragile water resources. According to the World Bank Open Data, only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water.

## Analysis

Water security is a critical challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa, with:

* Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data)
* Limited electricity availability ([VERIFY] 53.3%) impacting various sectors, including healthcare and agriculture (World Bank Open Data)

Renewable energy solutions can help address these challenges by providing reliable power for critical services and supporting climate adaptation efforts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Renewable Energy Projects**:
	* Invest in solar-powered mini-grids to provide reliable electricity for rural clinics.
	* Support wind and hydro projects to supplement grid power, ensuring continuous operation during droughts or other disruptions.
2. **Enhance Water Security Measures**:
	* Implement rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants where feasible.
	* Promote climate-resilient irrigation techniques like drip irrigation to conserve water resources.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in renewable energy projects can be substantial, but long-term savings on diesel fuel and grid maintenance outweigh initial costs. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and international partners is essential for successful implementation.

## Conclusion

Immediate action is needed to bridge the water security gap in Sub-Saharan Africa through renewable energy and climate adaptation strategies. We urge stakeholders to work together to overcome barriers and invest in sustainable solutions that benefit communities now and into the future.
