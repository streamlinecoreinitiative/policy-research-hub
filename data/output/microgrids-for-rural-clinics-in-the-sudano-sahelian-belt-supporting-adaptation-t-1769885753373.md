**Climate Resilient Water Security, Renewable Energy Access in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Call for Action**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water and reliable energy sources due to climate variability. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1], and less than half (53.3%) with access to electricity [2], urgent action is needed to ensure sustainable development and resilience against future shocks. We recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy and improved water management infrastructure to address these pressing issues.

## Context & Challenge

Climate change exacerbates existing challenges, including unreliable rainfall patterns affecting freshwater availability. The region's high population growth and limited resources pose immediate risks to human health, economic productivity, and environmental sustainability [3]. According to the World Bank Open Data, only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water, highlighting critical gaps in water security.

## Analysis

### Water Security

* Only 32.4% of the Sub-Saharan African population has access to safely managed drinking water [1].
* Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of global resources, with a significant portion coming from this region [4].
* Climate change impacts such as droughts and floods threaten existing water security.

### Renewable Energy

* Despite global trends, only 19.7% of final energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa comes from renewable sources [5].
* The region's vast solar and wind resources remain largely untapped.
* Accelerating renewable energy deployment can reduce dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change impacts.

### Climate Adaptation

* Climate change poses significant risks to existing water security and access to electricity in the region.
* Building resilience through investments in renewable energy and improved water management infrastructure is critical for long-term sustainability.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Accelerate Renewable Energy Deployment**:
	* Increase public investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects by 20% annually over the next five years [6].
	* Implement feed-in tariffs and tax incentives for renewable energy adoption.
	* Support research and development initiatives focused on improving efficiency and affordability of renewable technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa.
2. **Enhance Water Management Infrastructure**:
	* Invest in water harvesting systems, desalination plants, and wastewater treatment facilities by 15% annually over the next five years [7].
	* Promote community-led initiatives to improve local water supply resilience.
	* Strengthen institutional frameworks for managing water resources sustainably.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments of $10 billion over the next five years are estimated to achieve significant improvements in both renewable energy access and water security. Addressing technical, financial, and regulatory challenges through collaboration between government entities, private sector partners, and international organizations is crucial for successful implementation.

## Conclusion

Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must work together to implement these recommendations to build a more resilient Sub-Saharan Africa. Immediate and sustained efforts are needed to ensure access to clean water and reliable energy sources for all citizens, thereby supporting long-term economic growth and social stability.
