# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces significant water security challenges due to climate change. Traditional irrigation methods exacerbate these issues, contributing to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This brief explores the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a climate-resilient solution for irrigation cooperatives in the region.

**Climate Change Impacts on Water Scarcity**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is characterized by erratic rainfall patterns, with average annual rainfall ranging from 800-1200 mm. Precipitation variability is high, leading to water scarcity issues in the region.

*   **Rationale:** Climate change impacts agriculture, specifically characterized by erratic rainfall patterns.
*   **Water loss percentages from traditional irrigation systems:**
    *   Evaporation: [verify]%
    *   Seepage: [verify]%

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating poverty among smallholder farmers. Borehole pumps consume 10-20 kWh/day, while canal systems experience significant water loss due to evaporation and seepage.

*   **Rationale:** Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating poverty among smallholder farmers.
*   **Economic impact assessment:**
    *   Cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods: [verify] $/year

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it more resilient to climate change impacts. Benefits of agroforestry include:

*   **Soil organic matter:** [verify]%
*   **Biodiversity:** [verify]% increase in native species
*   **Carbon sequestration:** [verify] tons/ha/year

Case studies from other regions demonstrate successful implementation of agroforestry systems.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Key data points include:

*   **Power generation:** 10-50 kW per system
*   **Energy efficiency:** [verify]%
*   **Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods:**

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. Cost estimates and financial viability analysis are necessary to determine the effectiveness of these integrated approaches.

*   **Total project cost:** [verify] $/ha
*   **Return on investment (ROI):** [verify] years

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions. Future research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability.

*   **Incentives for farmers:** Subsidies, low-interest loans
*   **Grid integration with micro-hydro systems**
*   **Infrastructure development:** Roads, storage facilities

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Conduct a thorough climate data analysis to determine the specific water scarcity challenges in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.
2.  Develop and implement cost-effective agroforestry-micro-hydro projects that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up.
3.  Establish policy measures to support farmers in adopting sustainable irrigation solutions, including incentives and infrastructure development.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems has the potential to address water scarcity issues in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from critical sectors. By implementing these climate-resilient solutions, we can contribute to sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption.
