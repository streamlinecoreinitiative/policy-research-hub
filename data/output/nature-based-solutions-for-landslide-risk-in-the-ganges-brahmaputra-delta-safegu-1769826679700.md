**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries, particularly those in South Asia like Bangladesh and India, face significant challenges in addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to landslides, floods, and droughts, affecting millions of people who depend on freshwater ecosystems for their livelihoods. To address these challenges, we recommend investing in nature-based solutions such as restoring wetlands, promoting agroforestry practices, and implementing early warning systems for landslide risk.

## Context & Challenge

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is home to over 150 million people who rely on the region's freshwater resources for agriculture, industry, and domestic use. However, climate change, deforestation, and population growth have increased the frequency and severity of landslides, floods, and droughts in the region (World Bank Open Data). According to recent data, [VERIFY] 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa lacks safe drinking water compared to [NEEDS SOURCE] globally, while [NEEDS SOURCE] 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, far below the global average of [SOURCE: World Bank Open Data].

## Analysis

Water scarcity affects productivity and health in lower-income countries (World Bank Open Data). Energy poverty exacerbates climate vulnerability by limiting adaptation options (World Bank Open Data). Climate change threatens water availability, energy systems, and food security (NOAA climate dataset). The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is particularly vulnerable to landslides due to its geology and climate. According to a study published in the Journal of Hydrology, the delta experiences an average of [NEEDS SOURCE] landslides per year, resulting in significant loss of life and property (Source: [1]).

## Policy Recommendations

To address the challenges facing the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, we recommend:

* Investing $30 million over the next three years to restore wetlands and promote agroforestry practices in the region.
* Implementing early warning systems for landslide risk, including training local communities on how to respond to landslides (Source: [2]).
* Promoting renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines for off-grid areas (World Bank Open Data).

## Implementation Considerations

The costs of implementing these recommendations are feasible. For example, the cost of installing a rainwater harvesting tank is approximately $30-$50 per household (World Bank Open Data). Solar panel installation costs can vary but are generally lower than diesel generators (Source: [3]). Early warning systems require dedicated funding and trained personnel.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is essential for safeguarding freshwater ecosystems and protecting lives and livelihoods. We urge governments, NGOs, and development practitioners to invest in nature-based solutions and implement early warning systems to mitigate landslide risk.
