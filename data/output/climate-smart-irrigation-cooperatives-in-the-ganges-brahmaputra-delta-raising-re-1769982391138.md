# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: raising resilience finance for communities

**Boosting Sub-Saharan Africa's Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience: A Comprehensive Policy Agenda**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives. These cooperatives will provide a holistic approach to improving water management practices, enhancing renewable energy access, and building climate resilience. By investing in these cooperatives, governments can ensure that communities have access to safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and sustainable energy sources.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental challenges, including limited freshwater resources and unreliable electricity supply (World Bank, 2023). The region's population is projected to grow by [VERIFY] annually between 2020 and 2030, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities (UN-DESA, 2022). Climate change further compounds these issues, leading to more frequent droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

According to the World Bank, only [VERIFY]% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This translates to approximately [NEEDS SOURCE] people lacking this basic service. Electricity access is even more dire, with just 53.3% of the population having reliable access (World Bank, 2023).

## Analysis

The current situation in Sub-Saharan Africa underscores the need for comprehensive policy interventions. For instance, community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs have proven effective in improving access to safe drinking water in other regions (World Bank, 2024). Similarly, renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7% globally (World Bank, 2020), indicating a significant gap in meeting Sub-Saharan Africa's needs.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Develop and implement climate-resilient irrigation systems that integrate renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
2. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Implement CLTS programs and promote water filtration technologies to improve access to safe drinking water for vulnerable communities.
3. **Enhance Renewable Energy Access**: Develop mini-grids and off-grid renewable energy solutions, such as solar home systems and biogas digesters, to address electricity gaps and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure successful implementation of these recommendations, several practical steps are necessary:

1. **Funding Mechanisms**: Establish dedicated funds for water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience through international partnerships and grants.
2. **Capacity Building**: Train local communities in water management practices and renewable energy technologies to build community ownership and capacity.

## Conclusion

The challenges faced by Sub-Saharan Africa in accessing safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and sustainable energy sources are profound. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this policy brief, governments can significantly improve water security, enhance clean energy access, and build climate resilience. This not only addresses immediate needs but also lays a foundation for long-term sustainability and development.

**Call to Action**: Encourage policymakers at all levels to prioritize these interventions within their national plans and budgets. Collaboration across sectors and international partners is essential to achieving these goals.
