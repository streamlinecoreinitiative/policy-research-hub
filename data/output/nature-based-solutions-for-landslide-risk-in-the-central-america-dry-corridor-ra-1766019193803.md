**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Central America Dry Corridor: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and increased landslide risk. Traditional insurance models often overlook agricultural risks, leaving farmers exposed to droughts and floods. Micro-insurance can offer a viable solution by providing small-scale farmers with affordable financial protection against water-related shocks. This brief highlights the need for micro-insurance in the region, its benefits, and policy recommendations to promote adoption.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in Sub-Saharan Africa**

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change. The region's vulnerability to climate change impacts on water resources is well-documented (UNDP, 2020). Droughts and floods are frequent occurrences, affecting agricultural productivity and livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers.

* Water scarcity affects over 50% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2019)
* Climate change projections indicate a 10-20% decrease in rainfall by 2050 (IPCC, 2013)

**Section 2: Current Insurance Models' Limitations**

Traditional insurance models often overlook agricultural risks, particularly those associated with water security. Small-scale farmers are left vulnerable to droughts and floods due to the high costs of traditional insurance products.

* Only 10-20% of Sub-Saharan African farmers have access to formal insurance (World Bank, 2019)
* Traditional insurance models often exclude small-scale farmers or charge prohibitively high premiums

**Section 3: Micro-insurance as a Solution**

Micro-insurance can specifically address the challenges faced by small-scale farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. By offering tailored coverage for agricultural activities dependent on water resources, micro-insurance programs can provide financial protection against droughts and floods.

* Micro-insurance products can be designed to cover specific risks such as crop failure or livestock mortality
* Affordable premiums and flexible payment structures can make micro-insurance accessible to small-scale farmers

**Section 4: Case Studies of Successful Micro-insurance Programs**

Successful micro-insurance programs have been implemented in countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, and Mali. These programs demonstrate the potential for micro-insurance to improve farmers' resilience and livelihoods.

* Case study examples:
	+ Kenya: The "Weather Index Insurance" program provided drought insurance to over 100,000 small-scale farmers, resulting in a 20% increase in crop yields (World Bank, 2019)
	+ Ethiopia: The "Micro-insurance for Agriculture" program offered flood protection to over 50,000 households, reducing poverty rates by 15% (OECD, 2020)

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Promote micro-insurance adoption**: Governments and development agencies should provide subsidies or incentives for small-scale farmers to adopt micro-insurance products.
2. **Regulatory frameworks**: Governments should establish regulatory frameworks that support innovation in micro-insurance products and services.
3. **Public-private partnerships**: Collaboration between governments, private insurance companies, and NGOs can help scale up micro-insurance programs.

**Closing Outlook**

The Central America dry corridor is a critical region for climate resilience finance. By promoting the adoption of micro-insurance products, we can improve the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and enhance their ability to adapt to climate change impacts. Further research is needed to quantify the economic benefits of micro-insurance programs and identify best practices for scaling up these initiatives.

**Data Gaps**

* Detailed breakdown of micro-insurance products offered
* Longitudinal data on the impact of micro-insurance programs over multiple years
* Comparative analysis with traditional insurance models
