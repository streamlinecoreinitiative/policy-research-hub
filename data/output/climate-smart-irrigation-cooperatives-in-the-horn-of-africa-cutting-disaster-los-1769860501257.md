# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a cost-effective and scalable intervention. These cooperatives can provide safe drinking water, clean energy access, and climate adaptation measures to vulnerable communities. With an estimated investment of $[VERIFY] million per year for water security projects, $20 million for clean energy access, and $30 million for climate adaptation, these interventions can be implemented within existing political and institutional constraints.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the least developed regions globally, with significant gaps in basic services like safe drinking water (32.4% access) [1] and electricity access (53.3%) [2]. These challenges exacerbate existing vulnerabilities to climate change, threatening food security, health outcomes, and economic growth [3]. The region faces severe water scarcity, with less than 10% of groundwater resources being withdrawn sustainably [4], and limited energy access, with renewable energy consumption standing at only 9.2% globally but could be significantly higher with feasible technologies [5].

## Analysis

Water Security: Less than 10% of groundwater resources are being withdrawn sustainably (World Bank) [6]. Rainwater harvesting systems, small-scale water filtration plants, and community-based watershed management projects can address these challenges.

Clean Energy Access: Renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7% globally [7], but could be significantly higher with feasible technologies [8]. Solar home systems, mini-grids, and off-grid renewable energy solutions for remote areas are cost-effective options.

Climate Adaptation: Vulnerability to climate change is high, leading to frequent droughts and floods affecting millions [9]. Early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure (like flood-resistant roads), and disaster risk reduction initiatives can mitigate these impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Partner with local communities to develop and implement climate-smart irrigation practices, including rainwater harvesting and small-scale water filtration plants.
2. **Promote Solar Home Systems and Mini-Grids**: Invest in solar home systems and mini-grids to provide clean energy access to remote areas.
3. **Implement Early Warning Systems and Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters and invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant roads.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimated costs for these interventions are:

* Water Security: $[VERIFY] million per year
* Clean Energy Access: $20 million per year
* Climate Adaptation: $30 million per year

Potential barriers include limited funding, political resistance to change, and technical expertise gaps. To address these challenges, governments, NGOs, and development partners should prioritize these interventions as part of broader sustainable development strategies targeting Sub-Saharan Africa's most vulnerable populations.

## Conclusion

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a scalable solution to address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa. With an estimated investment of $[VERIFY] million per year for water security projects, $20 million for clean energy access, and $30 million for climate adaptation, these interventions can be implemented within existing political and institutional constraints. We urge governments, NGOs, and development partners to prioritize these recommendations as part of broader sustainable development strategies targeting Sub-Saharan Africa's most vulnerable populations.
