# urban heat mitigation through cool roofs in the Great Lakes region: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Enhancing Water Security, Renewable Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the critical challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing the implementation of solar-powered desalination plants to provide safe drinking water for vulnerable populations. This approach can be complemented by incentivizing rooftop solar installations for households and businesses, as well as establishing policies that mandate a certain percentage of energy consumption from renewables.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security and clean energy access. According to the World Bank (2024), only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], while renewable energy consumption is at just 9.2% of total final energy consumption (World Bank, 2021) [2]. These conditions exacerbate existing challenges such as food insecurity and health issues related to inadequate sanitation.

## Analysis

Recent data highlights a stark contrast between Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacking safe water (2.2 billion people) [3] and its renewable energy consumption percentage (9.2%) [4]. While there has been some progress in electrification rates, reaching 53.3% of the population with electricity access as of 2023 [5], this remains insufficient given the region's vast population size.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water:** Implement solar-powered desalination plants and provide subsidies for household filtration units. Target remote areas and communities where access is least available.
	* Data Point: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water [1].
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration:** Invest in solar-powered desalination plants and incentivize rooftop solar installations for households and businesses. Establish policies that mandate a certain percentage of energy consumption from renewables.
	* Data Point: Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is only 9.2% [4].
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience:** Develop early warning systems and climate adaptation plans for water resources management. Support micro-hydro power projects in rural areas to improve resilience against droughts.
	* Data Point: Only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity [5].

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost:** Initial investments in solar-powered desalination plants and desalination can be substantial but offset by long-term savings on healthcare costs from reduced waterborne diseases.
- **Barriers:** Resistance from local communities who may not understand the benefits of new technologies or lack access to financing mechanisms.

## Conclusion

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that leverages both public and private sector resources. By prioritizing renewable energy integration, expanding safe drinking water access, and enhancing climate resilience, Sub-Saharan Africa can build a more sustainable future for its populations.
