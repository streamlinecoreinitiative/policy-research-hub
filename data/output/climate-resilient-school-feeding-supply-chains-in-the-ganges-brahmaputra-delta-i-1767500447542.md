**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, home to over 40 million people, is highly vulnerable to climate change. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns threaten food security, exacerbating poverty and malnutrition among children. This brief highlights the importance of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in addressing these challenges.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical agricultural region, with over 70% of its population relying on agriculture for their livelihood. Climate change has led to increased water scarcity, impacting crop yields and food security. Rising temperatures have also resulted in more frequent heatwaves, posing significant health risks to schoolchildren.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta are often inefficient, resulting in high water losses through evaporation and seepage. These systems rely heavily on diesel generators, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, they frequently break down during peak usage periods, further exacerbating food insecurity.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion, retain water, and increase crop yields. Case studies from the region demonstrate that agroforestry-based irrigation systems can reduce water usage.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution for efficient irrigation. These small-scale hydroelectric systems harness the energy of flowing water, reducing reliance on diesel generators and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

## Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have successfully integrated agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into irrigation practices. These initiatives have demonstrated significant reductions in water usage and increased crop yields. Furthermore, these systems have helped mitigate heat-related illnesses among schoolchildren by providing access to clean drinking water.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains:

1.  **Develop policy frameworks** that incentivize the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into irrigation practices.
2.  **Establish training programs** for farmers, focusing on efficient water management and micro-hydro system maintenance.
3.  **Invest in research and development**, exploring new technologies and approaches to enhance climate resilience.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are critical for improving health outcomes among children in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into irrigation practices, communities can address water scarcity, reduce energy costs, and mitigate heat-related illnesses. With the right policy support and investment in research and development, this approach has the potential to transform food security and health outcomes in one of the world's most vulnerable regions.
