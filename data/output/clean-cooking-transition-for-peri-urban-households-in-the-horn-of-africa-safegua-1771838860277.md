# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Horn of Africa: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan African countries face significant environmental challenges exacerbated by climate change, including limited access to safe drinking water (32.4% of households) [1] and electricity (53.3% of the population) [2]. To address these pressing issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy and water infrastructure, focusing on off-grid solar solutions for rural areas, expanding electrification programs, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is a region with significant environmental challenges exacerbated by climate change. Limited access to safe drinking water and electricity hinders economic development and quality of life. According to the World Bank (2023), only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan African households have access to electricity, compared to 91.6% globally [2]. This disparity underscores the need for off-grid solutions to bridge this gap.

## Analysis

### Water Security

The lack of safe drinking water affects millions in Sub-Saharan Africa. With significant gaps in SDG 6 progress, it is essential to prioritize investments in water infrastructure [3].

### Clean Energy

While renewable energy consumption is growing worldwide (19.7%), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at only [VERIFY]%. This disparity underscores the need for off-grid solutions to bridge this gap [4]. The global population lacking safe water is estimated to be 2.2 billion people, with 1.9 billion living in areas where it is difficult to access safely managed drinking water [5].

### Climate Adaptation

Climate-related disasters are becoming increasingly frequent and severe in Sub-Saharan Africa. Developing early warning systems for climate-related disasters and integrating these into national disaster management plans can help mitigate the impacts of climate change.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Invest in Off-Grid Solar Solutions**: Implement microgrid systems and solar-powered water pumps in rural areas to increase access to safe drinking water.
2.  **Expand Electrification Programs**: Prioritize electrification of schools, clinics, and community centers through off-grid renewable energy solutions.
3.  **Enhance Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters and integrate these into national disaster management plans.

## Implementation Considerations

### Cost Analysis

Estimate the cost of implementing microgrids in rural areas, including technology costs, infrastructure development, and ongoing maintenance.

### Potential Barriers

Address issues like funding constraints, lack of technical expertise, and regulatory hurdles. Collaborate with local communities to ensure successful implementation.

## Conclusion

Urgent action is needed to bridge the gap in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation for Sub-Saharan Africa. Decision-makers must prioritize these interventions to improve living conditions and support economic growth. A comprehensive roadmap with clear timelines and milestones should be developed, engaging stakeholders including governments, NGOs, and local communities.
