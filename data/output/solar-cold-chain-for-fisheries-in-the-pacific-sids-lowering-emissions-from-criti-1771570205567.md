**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Pacific SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, renewable energy, and climate adaptation challenges. With only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), it is imperative that governments and development practitioners prioritize investments in infrastructure that promote rainwater harvesting, solar-powered water purification systems, and renewable energy integration.

### Key Findings

* Only [VERIFY]53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).
* The region's renewable energy consumption is only 9.2%, well below global averages and essential targets set by SDGs (World Bank Open Data).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges with water security, low access to electricity, and climate vulnerability. This region lacks the basic necessities of safe drinking water and reliable energy sources, which are crucial for economic development and social stability. Addressing these issues is not only a matter of human rights but also an essential step towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs).

### Background

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the world's least developed regions, with limited access to clean water and electricity. The region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods.

## Analysis

The statistics underscore the critical need for improved infrastructure:

* Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024): 32.4 [Source: World Bank Open Data]
* Renewable energy consumption (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024): 9.2 [Source: World Bank Open Data]

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
   * Implement community-based water management initiatives that promote rainwater harvesting and solar-powered water purification systems.

3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**:
   * Support climate-resilient agricultural practices and improve irrigation efficiency to reduce dependence on traditional water sources.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in infrastructure can be substantial but are offset by long-term savings from reduced energy consumption and improved health outcomes. Political will, community engagement, and availability of funds are crucial for successful implementation.

## Conclusion

To achieve sustainable development goals in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is imperative to prioritize investments in water security, renewable energy integration, and climate adaptation measures. By leveraging available resources and fostering collaborative efforts between governments, NGOs, and communities, these interventions can help create a more resilient future for the region.
