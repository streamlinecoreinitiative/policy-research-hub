**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Mekong Basin: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends a focus on resilience-building strategies in water security, clean energy, and adaptation to address the triple challenge of Sub-Saharan Africa's water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. To strengthen infrastructure and services, we propose investing in sustainable water supply systems, promoting renewable energy solutions, and enhancing early warning systems for climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change impacts, with [VERIFY] % of its population lacking access to safe drinking water and only 53.3% having electricity access (World Bank, 2024; World Bank Open Data). The region's economy heavily relies on agriculture, which is particularly susceptible to climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Despite some progress, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in achieving SDG 6 targets for water access and management. Only [VERIFY] % of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). Improving this would require significant investment in infrastructure like wells and pipelines.

### Clean Energy

The region's renewable energy consumption is a mere [VERIFY] %, far below global averages (World Bank, 2023). Sub-Saharan Africa's low electrification rates mean that many communities depend on costly diesel generators or unreliable grid connections, leading to high costs and inefficient power usage.

### Climate Adaptation

With only [VERIFY] % of the region’s population covered by early warning systems for climate-related disasters, there is a pressing need for enhanced monitoring and response mechanisms (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Water Infrastructure**: Invest in sustainable water supply systems such as solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds to improve access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Solutions**: Develop and implement microgrid projects powered by renewable energy sources (solar, wind) for remote communities that are not served by the grid.
3. **Enhance Early Warning Systems**: Establish comprehensive climate monitoring networks with real-time data collection and dissemination mechanisms to improve early warning capabilities.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Financial Support**: Securing funding through international aid, concessional loans from development banks, and innovative financing models like green bonds will be crucial for scaling up these initiatives.
- **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)**: Encourage collaborations between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to leverage resources and expertise.
- **Community Engagement**: Ensure that communities are involved in planning and implementation processes to maximize ownership and sustainability.

## Conclusion

Addressing the challenges of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders. By focusing on resilience-building strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa, we can create more sustainable and resilient communities. Let us take decisive action now to secure a brighter future for our citizens.
