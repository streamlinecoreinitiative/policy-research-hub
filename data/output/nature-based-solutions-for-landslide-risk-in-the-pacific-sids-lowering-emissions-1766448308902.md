# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Pacific SIDS: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in Pacific Small Island Developing States: Enhancing Resilience through Integrated Approaches**

**Executive Summary**

The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are vulnerable to climate-related natural hazards, including landslides, which pose significant threats to their economic and social stability. This brief highlights the importance of integrating nature-based solutions with critical sectors such as water security and clean energy to enhance resilience in these regions.

**Section 1: Introduction to Landslide Risk and Climate Change Impacts**

The Pacific SIDS are exposed to an increased risk of landslides due to climate change, which exacerbates soil erosion, flooding, and other natural hazards. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns contribute to the degradation of ecosystems, leading to reduced vegetation cover and increased landslide susceptibility.

**Section 2: Current Practices and Challenges in Water Security and Clean Energy**

Traditional irrigation systems in the Pacific SIDS rely heavily on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, energy-intensive water treatment processes further strain resources and exacerbate environmental degradation. The high cost of traditional irrigation methods hinders economic development, particularly for small-scale farmers.

**Section 3: Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk Reduction**

1. **Agroforestry-based Micro-Hydro Systems**
   - Agroforestry practices enhance soil health, reduce erosion, and promote biodiversity.
   - Integrated with micro-hydro systems, these solutions provide renewable energy while reducing water loss through evaporation and seepage.

2. **Climate-Resilient Water Supply Management**
   - Implementing efficient irrigation methods that minimize water waste and optimize resource use.
   - Promoting the adoption of climate-resilient crops and agricultural practices.

3. **Community Engagement and Capacity Building**
   - Educating local communities on the benefits and implementation strategies for nature-based solutions.
   - Developing capacity-building programs to enhance community resilience and adaptive management capabilities.

**Section 4: Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

1. **Subsidies and Grants**
   - Governments should consider offering subsidies or grants to support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems and climate-resilient water supply management practices.
   
2. **Infrastructure Development**
   - Investing in infrastructure improvements, such as roads and electricity grids, is crucial for facilitating the implementation of these nature-based solutions.

3. **Long-term Sustainability Assessments**
   - Conducting long-term assessments to evaluate the sustainability of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
   
4. **Community Engagement Strategies**
   - Developing effective community engagement strategies to ensure local buy-in and participation in project planning, implementation, and monitoring.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

- Governments should prioritize investments in nature-based solutions for landslide risk reduction.
- International organizations should provide technical assistance and capacity-building support to Pacific SIDS.
- Local communities must be engaged in the development and implementation of these solutions through participatory approaches.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry, micro-hydro systems, and climate-resilient water supply management practices offers a promising pathway for reducing landslide risk and enhancing environmental resilience in the Pacific SIDS. By adopting nature-based solutions and fostering community engagement, we can create more sustainable, equitable, and climate-resilient futures for these vulnerable regions.
