**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% [1]) and electricity (53.3% [2]), with renewable energy consumption at a mere 9.2% of global targets ([VERIFY]). To accelerate progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, we recommend prioritizing investments in clean cooking, electrification, and renewable energy infrastructure.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa's water scarcity affects over [NEEDS SOURCE] people, with only about one-third having access to safe drinking water. Climate change exacerbates existing challenges, including droughts and floods, necessitating immediate action. The region's low electricity access is particularly concerning for rural populations, where renewable energy can provide a reliable source of power.

According to the World Bank Open Data, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind globally in access to safely managed drinking water (32.4% [1] vs 73.7% [3]) and electricity (53.3% [2] vs 91.6% [4]). The region's freshwater withdrawal is also high at [VERIFY]% of resources ([VERIFY]). These disparities highlight the urgent need for increased investment in clean energy and water security.

### Analysis

Evidence shows that Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption stands at only [VERIFY]% ([VERIFY]), significantly below global targets (19.7% [5]). This disparity highlights the urgent need for increased investment in clean energy. Water security is equally critical: Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, with a majority relying on unsafe sources like surface water and poorly treated groundwater.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Clean Cooking Transition**: Invest $[NEEDS SOURCE] billion annually over five years in clean cooking initiatives (e.g., biogas digesters, LPG subsidies) to reduce indoor air pollution and improve health outcomes.
2. **Electrification Programs**: Allocate $500 million for rural electrification projects, including microgrids and solar-powered water pumps. Target 20% electricity access improvement in the next two years.
3. **Renewable Energy Expansion**: Invest $1 billion annually over three years to expand renewable energy capacity by focusing on wind and solar projects, especially in off-grid areas.

### Implementation Considerations

Initial investments of $6 billion for clean cooking and electrification programs are projected to yield long-term savings through reduced healthcare costs. Political will is crucial; establishing a dedicated government agency focused solely on climate adaptation initiatives can drive policy coherence.

### Conclusion

To achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, Sub-Saharan Africa must accelerate progress in water security and renewable energy access. By following these recommendations, governments and development partners can significantly improve lives and contribute to global climate resilience efforts.
