# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, one of the world's most densely populated regions, faces significant environmental challenges. This brief focuses on peri-urban households' transition to clean cooking practices and explores strategies for raising resilience finance in communities affected by climate change.

### Introduction

Climate change has severe implications for water security, clean energy access, and community resilience in lower-income countries. The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is particularly vulnerable due to its dense population, geography, and existing environmental degradation. This brief aims to address these challenges through a comprehensive approach to transitioning peri-urban households to clean cooking practices while raising resilience finance for affected communities.

## Environmental Resilience in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

### Water Security Challenges

*   The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is heavily reliant on groundwater, with extraction rates exceeding recharge rates.
*   Climate change exacerbates water scarcity through erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation due to rising temperatures.
*   Existing irrigation systems are inefficient, leading to significant water loss (e.g., [verify] 30% evaporation, [verify] 5% seepage).

### Clean Energy Access

*   The majority of peri-urban households rely on traditional cooking methods, which contribute to indoor air pollution and health issues.
*   Transitioning to clean energy sources, such as biogas or solar-powered cookstoves, is crucial for improving household health and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

## Climate Adaptation and Resilience Finance

### Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems

*   Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can improve water retention, reduce erosion, and enhance soil health.
*   Pilot projects demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of these integrated solutions, which can be scaled up for wider adoption.

### Raising Resilience Finance

*   Financial instruments, such as green bonds or climate-resilient infrastructure funds, can support community-led initiatives for clean cooking transitions and agroforestry-micro-hydro system implementation.
*   Partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities are essential for mobilizing resources and promoting policy change.

## Policy Recommendations

### Short-Term Actions:

1.  Conduct a comprehensive assessment of peri-urban households' energy needs and existing cooking practices.
2.  Develop a roadmap for transitioning to clean energy sources and implementing agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  Establish partnerships with financial institutions to mobilize resources for community-led initiatives.

### Long-Term Directions:

1.  Integrate climate-resilient infrastructure development into national planning frameworks.
2.  Promote policy reforms supporting the adoption of clean energy sources and agroforestry practices.
3.  Foster international cooperation to share best practices and leverage global expertise in resilience finance.

## Closing Outlook

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta's environmental challenges require a comprehensive approach that prioritizes community-led initiatives, climate-resilient infrastructure development, and policy change. By raising resilience finance for peri-urban households and promoting clean cooking transitions, we can contribute to the region's long-term sustainability and improve the lives of millions of people affected by climate change.
