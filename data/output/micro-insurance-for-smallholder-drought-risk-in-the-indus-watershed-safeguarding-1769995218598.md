**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in water security (32.4% access to safely managed drinking water) [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024] and clean energy access (53.3% of population with electricity), exacerbating the impacts of climate change. To address these critical issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy, enhancing water management systems, and developing early warning systems for climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 85% of global arid and semi-arid areas [Source: Wikipedia]. The region faces severe challenges in accessing safe drinking water, with only 32.4% of its population having access [World Bank Open Data, 2024]. Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa's water resources are under strain due to overuse and pollution [Source: World Bank, 2024]. Access to safe drinking water is particularly low in rural areas. According to the World Bank Open Data (2024), only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water.

### Clean Energy

Despite global goals, only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity [Source: World Bank, 2023]. Renewable energy consumption is at just 19.7% of total final energy consumption [World Bank Open Data, 2020].

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts, such as increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, are becoming more pronounced in the region.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Access**:
	* Increase funding for renewable energy projects through government subsidies and grants.
	* Promote decentralized solar power solutions like mini-grids and off-grid systems to reach remote communities.
	* Encourage public-private partnerships to leverage additional resources and expertise in rural areas.

2. **Water Management Systems**:
	* Invest in wastewater treatment plants to reduce pollution, improving water quality for drinking purposes.
	* Implement rainwater harvesting systems and groundwater recharge projects to increase available freshwater supplies.
	* Strengthen institutional capacity at the local level by training water resource managers and community leaders on sustainable practices.

3. **Early Warning Systems**:
	* Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters (floods, droughts) using satellite imagery and weather forecasting data.
	* Establish partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and international organizations to ensure timely dissemination of information to affected communities.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing renewable energy projects can range from $10-$50 per capita [VERIFY]. Water management system investments may cost up to $3-$5 per capita annually. Potential barriers include political resistance, limited financial resources for initial investment, and infrastructure challenges in remote areas.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries must address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to achieve sustainable development. By prioritizing renewable energy investments, enhancing water management systems, and developing early warning systems, decision-makers can mitigate current vulnerabilities and build resilient communities. Collaboration among government officials, NGOs, and international partners is crucial for successful implementation.

**Call to Action**: Engage in collaborative efforts to develop and implement these recommendations. Support projects that demonstrate tangible progress towards achieving SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).
