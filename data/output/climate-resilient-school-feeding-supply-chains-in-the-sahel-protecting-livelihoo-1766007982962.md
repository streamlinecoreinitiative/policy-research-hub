**Climate-resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

The arid Sahel region is facing severe water scarcity exacerbated by climate change, leading to poor agricultural yields and increased food insecurity. This brief explores micro-insurance schemes as a key adaptation strategy for enhancing water security and climate resilience in this region. By providing vulnerable farmers with financial protection against crop failures and livestock losses, micro-insurance can significantly mitigate the risks associated with climate stress. The brief highlights the current challenges faced by farmers, the role of micro-insurance in addressing these challenges, and the economic impact analysis of implementing such schemes.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Arid Sahel**

The arid Sahel region spans across several countries in West Africa, including Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Somalia. The region's geography is characterized by a semi-arid to arid climate, with low rainfall and high evaporation rates. Climate change has exacerbated the water scarcity in this region, leading to poor agricultural yields and increased food insecurity.

* **Impact on Agriculture:**
	+ Reduced crop yields due to droughts and heat stress.
	+ Decreased livestock productivity due to lack of feed and water.
	+ Increased soil erosion and degradation.
* **Impact on Livelihoods:**
	+ Food insecurity and malnutrition among rural communities.
	+ Loss of income and livelihood opportunities for farmers.
	+ Migration of people from rural areas to urban centers in search of employment.

**Section 2: Current Challenges: Vulnerable Farmers' Financial Protection Needs**

Farmers in the arid Sahel region face significant challenges in accessing financial protection against crop failures and livestock losses. Traditional insurance options are often unaffordable or inaccessible, leaving farmers vulnerable to climate-related shocks.

* **Limited Access to Insurance Options:**
	+ High premiums and deductibles.
	+ Lack of understanding about insurance products and their benefits.
	+ Limited availability of insurance services in rural areas.
* **High Frequency and Severity of Droughts:**
	+ Increased frequency and severity of droughts due to climate change.
	+ Higher risk of crop failures and livestock losses.

**Section 3: Role of Micro-insurance in the Arid Sahel Region**

Micro-insurance schemes can provide a tailored financial solution for vulnerable farmers in the arid Sahel region. These schemes offer affordable and accessible insurance products that cater to the specific needs of small-scale farmers.

* **Description of Micro-insurance Schemes:**
	+ Small-scale insurance policies designed for low-income individuals.
	+ Affordable premiums and deductibles.
	+ Simplified application and claims processes.
* **Examples of Successful Implementation Models:**
	+ Ethiopia's micro-insurance program for farmers.
	+ Burkina Faso's livestock insurance scheme.

**Section 4: Economic Impact Analysis**

Micro-insurance schemes can provide significant economic benefits to participating farmers. A cost-benefit analysis comparing traditional insurance with micro-insurance highlights the advantages of micro-insurance in terms of affordability and accessibility.

* **Cost-Effectiveness:**
	+ Lower premiums and deductibles.
	+ Higher payout amounts for participating farmers.
* **Financial Sustainability:**
	+ Savings and investment returns for participating farmers.
	+ Increased income and livelihood opportunities for farmers.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Governments in the Sahel region should provide subsidies and regulatory support to micro-insurance schemes.
2. International organizations and local NGOs should collaborate with governments to enhance program reach and impact.
3. Micro-insurance providers should integrate digital platforms to track claims, manage payouts, and monitor climate data.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sahel region require a multi-faceted approach that addresses water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. Micro-insurance schemes can play a critical role in enhancing climate resilience among vulnerable farmers by providing financial protection against crop failures and livestock losses. By scaling up micro-insurance programs and integrating digital platforms, we can protect livelihoods under climate stress and promote sustainable development in the Sahel region.

**Key Data Points Needed:**

* Cost per policy unit.
* Average payout amounts by type of claim.
* Number of participating farmers in successful programs.
* Savings and investment rates among insured versus non-insured groups.
* Government funding commitments for micro-insurance schemes.
* Climate data correlation with insurance claims frequency and severity.

**Data Gaps:**

* Long-term impact studies on climate resilience.
* Detailed cost analysis across different micro-insurance models.
* Socio-economic data on the sustainability of insurance payouts over time.
* Comparative effectiveness with other adaptation measures like water harvesting or crop diversification.
* Local stakeholder perceptions and acceptance levels towards digital platform integration.
