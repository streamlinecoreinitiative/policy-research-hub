# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate variability poses significant risks to water security, food production, and livelihoods of smallholder farmers in the arid Sahel region. Micro-insurance schemes offer a critical financial protection mechanism for these vulnerable populations, enabling them to invest in more resilient agricultural practices despite climate-related challenges. This brief highlights the importance of micro-insurance as an adaptation strategy, its current implementation status, impact evaluation data, and policy recommendations for scaling up such initiatives.

**Climate Variability and Water Security in the Sahel Region**

The Sahel region is characterized by high temperatures, low rainfall, and increasing frequency of droughts. Climate patterns in this area are influenced by global climate change, which exacerbates water scarcity and food insecurity among smallholder farmers. The importance of financial protection mechanisms for vulnerable populations cannot be overstated, as they enable communities to recover from climate-related shocks and invest in more resilient agricultural practices.

**Key Challenges Faced by Smallholder Farmers in the Sahel**

Smallholder farmers in the Sahel region face significant economic vulnerabilities due to low productivity and unstable income streams. Limited access to traditional insurance markets further exacerbates their risk exposure, making it challenging for them to recover from climate-related shocks. The lack of financial protection mechanisms hinders smallholder farmers' ability to invest in more resilient agricultural practices, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and vulnerability.

**Micro-insurance Schemes: A Solution for Financial Protection**

Micro-insurance schemes offer a tailored solution to address the specific needs of smallholder farmers in the Sahel region. These programs provide critical financial protection against drought-related risks, enabling farmers to invest in more resilient agricultural practices. Successful micro-insurance models have been implemented in various countries within the Sahel region, demonstrating their potential as an adaptation strategy.

**Impact Evaluation and Policy Recommendations**

Quantitative data from impact evaluations of micro-insurance programs indicate increased crop yields and farm income among insured farmers. Qualitative feedback from farmers highlights program effectiveness and satisfaction levels. To scale up micro-insurance schemes, policy frameworks should support the development of these initiatives by:

* Encouraging private sector investment in micro-insurance products
* Providing technical assistance to local NGOs and community-based organizations
* Developing climate-resilient agricultural practices that are integrated into micro-insurance programs

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  **Develop a policy framework** to support the scaling up of micro-insurance schemes, including incentives for private sector investment.
2.  **Provide technical assistance** to local NGOs and community-based organizations to develop climate-resilient agricultural practices.
3.  **Establish partnerships** between government agencies, international organizations, and local stakeholders to promote micro-insurance initiatives.

**Closing Outlook**

Micro-insurance schemes offer a critical financial protection mechanism for smallholder farmers in the Sahel region, enabling them to invest in more resilient agricultural practices despite climate-related challenges. To support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), governments, private sector entities, and international organizations should prioritize policy frameworks that promote micro-insurance initiatives. By scaling up these schemes, we can enhance water security, improve food production, and reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate-related shocks.

**Data Points Needed**

* Percentage of smallholder farmers who are insured under existing micro-insurance schemes in the Sahel region
* Average cost savings per farmer due to reduced crop losses through micro-insurance coverage
* Farmer satisfaction levels with current micro-insurance products (survey results or qualitative feedback)
* Government spending on climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction initiatives
