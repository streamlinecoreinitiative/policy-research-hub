# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: A Resilient Path Forward for Sub-Saharan Africa**

**Executive Summary**
This policy brief recommends prioritizing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa to enhance resilience against environmental shocks. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), and renewable energy consumption at just [VERIFY]19.7% of total final energy consumption (World Bank Open Data, 2020), urgent action is needed to ensure sustainable development paths for this region.

**Context & Challenge**
Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change due to its reliance on natural resources for basic needs like drinking water and electricity. Limited infrastructure leads to inefficient resource use, high vulnerability to environmental shocks, and a lack of resilient energy solutions (World Bank Open Data, 2023). The region must address these challenges to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to clean water, renewable energy, and climate resilience.

**Analysis**
- **Water Security**: Only [VERIFY]32.4% of the Sub-Saharan African population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), highlighting a critical gap in basic needs.
- **Clean Energy Access**: At just 53.3%, electricity access remains limited, particularly in rural areas where it is crucial for daily activities and economic development (World Bank Open Data, 2023).
- **Climate Adaptation**: Frequent droughts and floods underscore the need for better water management strategies and resilient energy solutions to mitigate climate impacts.

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Expand Water Infrastructure Projects**: Invest in rural water systems, including wells, boreholes, and rainwater harvesting facilities (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Implement cost-sharing mechanisms with local communities to ensure sustainability.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Initiatives**: Encourage the use of solar-powered mini-grids for off-grid areas, leveraging existing renewable energy projects and financing schemes (World Bank Open Data, 2020).
3. **Climate Resilience Programs**: Develop early-warning systems and climate adaptation plans in vulnerable regions to reduce disaster losses.

**Implementation Considerations**
- **Costs**: Initial investments for water infrastructure can range from $10,000-$50,000 per well, with additional costs for maintenance and training (World Bank Open Data, 2023). Renewable energy mini-grids typically cost between $20,000-$100,000.
- **Barriers**: Limited government funding, high upfront costs, and community resistance to change are potential barriers.

**Conclusion**
By prioritizing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, governments can enhance resilience against environmental shocks. Collaborative efforts between public and private sectors will be essential for successful implementation of these recommendations.
