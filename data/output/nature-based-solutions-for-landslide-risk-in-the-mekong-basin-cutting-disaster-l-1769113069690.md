**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Mekong Basin: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address landslide risk in the Mekong basin, which affects vulnerable communities and exacerbates poverty. To reduce disaster losses, we recommend investing in nature-based solutions such as afforestation initiatives, soil conservation programs, and early warning systems. Governments should prioritize these interventions, allocating $10-50 million per project for infrastructure development and capacity building.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water scarcity and energy poverty challenges (World Bank Open Data). Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data], while renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Climate change exacerbates these issues through erratic weather patterns, leading to droughts and floods that affect vulnerable communities.

## Analysis

The region's infrastructure development is hindered by inadequate investment in water management systems, poor governance, and insufficient funding for climate adaptation measures. The limited access to safe drinking water is a critical concern, with 2.2 billion people lacking access globally [Source: UN-Water/WHO]. In contrast, the global average for safely managed drinking water stands at 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Investment in Water Infrastructure**: Governments should prioritize the construction of modern water supply and sanitation facilities, including expanding piped water connections and improving wastewater treatment plants.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Initiatives**: Encourage investments in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power projects to increase renewable energy consumption. Provide subsidies or grants for households and businesses adopting clean energy solutions.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Measures**: Implement early warning systems and climate adaptation programs such as afforestation initiatives and construction of flood barriers.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires substantial financial support, which can come from international development partners or through innovative financing mechanisms like green bonds. Training and capacity building for local authorities in water management and renewable energy technologies are essential to ensure successful implementation.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's urgent need for enhanced access to clean water, electricity, and climate resilience is clear. By adopting evidence-based policy interventions supported by robust implementation strategies, the region can leapfrog unsustainable development paths towards more sustainable futures. Government officials, NGO leaders, and development practitioners must collaborate closely to realize these transformative changes.
