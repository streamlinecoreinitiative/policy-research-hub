Here's the revised brief:

# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Enhancing Environmental Resilience and Food Security

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant threats to food security, economic stability, and human well-being in lower-income countries. The Sahel region is particularly vulnerable due to its harsh climate conditions, limited water resources, and high dependence on rain-fed agriculture. This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into school feeding supply chains as a means of enhancing environmental resilience and improving food security.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries

The Sahel region is characterized by arid to semi-arid conditions, with limited water resources and high evaporation rates. Climate change exacerbates these challenges through increased temperature variability, altered precipitation patterns, and rising sea levels. The consequences of climate stress on agriculture include reduced crop yields, decreased food security, and increased economic vulnerability.

### Key Challenges:

• Severe water scarcity
• Erratic rainfall patterns
• Soil degradation
• Decreased crop yields

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address the challenges of climate change in agriculture. By integrating agroforestry practices with small-scale hydroelectric systems, farmers can:

• Improve soil health and fertility
• Enhance water retention and reduce erosion
• Increase crop yields and improve food security

### Case Studies:

* [Case Study 1]: Agroforestry-based micro-hydro system in [Location], demonstrating improved water retention and increased crop yields.
* [Case Study 2]: Integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in [Location], resulting in enhanced soil health and reduced erosion.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains, we recommend:

• Subsidies for farmers to invest in agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems
• Low-interest loans for infrastructure development and system installation
• Capacity building programs for farmers and extension agents on integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro practices

## Actions/Recommendations List

1. **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** to support the adoption of climate-resilient school feeding supply chains.
2. **Establish a network of demonstration sites** to showcase the effectiveness of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
3. **Provide technical assistance and capacity building programs** for farmers, extension agents, and policymakers.

## Closing Outlook

Climate change poses significant threats to food security, economic stability, and human well-being in lower-income countries. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into school feeding supply chains, we can enhance environmental resilience and improve food security. It is essential that policymakers, development agencies, and stakeholders work together to support the adoption of climate-resilient practices and technologies.
