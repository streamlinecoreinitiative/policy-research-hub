# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Great Lakes region: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Protecting Livelihoods in Drylands: Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience through Integrated Approaches**

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region is facing unprecedented climate-related challenges, including droughts and heatwaves, which exacerbate existing water scarcity and power outages. To address these interlinked issues, we recommend a comprehensive strategy combining water loss reduction initiatives, solar-powered renewable energy systems, and climate-smart agriculture practices. This integrated approach can significantly improve livelihoods in drylands while aligning with global sustainability goals.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to vast arid regions where water scarcity and power outages are common (World Bank Open Data). Climate change intensifies droughts and heatwaves, making it even more challenging to maintain water security and energy supply. Without addressing these challenges, millions of people will suffer from inadequate access to clean water, electricity, and food.

According to the World Bank, only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). This statistic underscores the critical need for improved water infrastructure and management. Furthermore, the region lags behind in terms of clean energy access, with only [VERIFY] % of its population having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).

## Analysis

### Water Security

The lack of access to safely managed drinking water is a significant concern in Sub-Saharan Africa. Only 32.4% of the population has access to such services (World Bank Open Data). This statistic highlights the need for improved water infrastructure and management.

### Clean Energy Access

Clean energy access is also a pressing issue in the region, with only [VERIFY] % of the population having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change intensifies droughts and heatwaves in these regions, making it even more challenging to maintain water security and energy supply.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Loss Reduction Initiatives**:
	* Implement advanced water metering systems to reduce leaks and waste (Source: World Bank).
	* Invest in rainwater harvesting ponds and solar-powered desalination plants to increase safe drinking water availability.
2. **Renewable Energy Systems**:
	* Deploy solar panels on rooftops, schools, and public buildings to provide clean energy access (Source: International Renewable Energy Agency).
	* Establish off-grid mini-grids powered by solar energy for rural communities without grid connectivity.
3. **Climate-Smart Agriculture Practices**:
	* Promote drought-resistant crop varieties and efficient irrigation systems using solar-powered pumps (Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations).

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investment in water metering and renewable energy infrastructure could be funded through grants or concessional loans from international organizations like the World Bank. Estimated costs for implementing these measures would vary but can be managed within existing development budgets.

## Conclusion

The urgent need for integrated approaches to enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in arid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa cannot be overstated. We urge governments, NGOs, and international partners to collaborate on implementing the recommended strategies to improve livelihoods in drylands while aligning with global sustainability goals.

By addressing these interlinked challenges through a comprehensive strategy combining water loss reduction initiatives, solar-powered renewable energy systems, and climate-smart agriculture practices, we can significantly improve health outcomes in heatwaves and ensure a more resilient future for millions of people living in the Great Lakes region.
