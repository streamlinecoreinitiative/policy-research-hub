# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate Resilient Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Pathway to Resilient Development**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, limited access to clean energy, and climate variability in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in climate-smart irrigation cooperatives. These cooperatives can improve water security by promoting efficient use of available resources, enhance clean energy adoption by leveraging off-grid renewable energy solutions, and bolster climate resilience through drought-tolerant crops and early warning systems.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan African countries face significant challenges in ensuring access to clean water, reliable electricity, and climate resilience. Despite global progress on some fronts, millions lack basic services like safe drinking water and electricity. Recent data highlights the urgency of these issues:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* Access to electricity stands at 53.3%, with a significant disparity between urban and rural areas (World Bank Open Data, 2023) [Source: World Bank Open Data].

## Analysis

The challenges faced by Sub-Saharan African countries are multifaceted and interrelated. Water scarcity not only affects human health but also hinders economic development, particularly in agriculture and industry. Similarly, limited electricity access stifles productivity and limits opportunities for sustainable growth. Climate change further compounds these issues by intensifying weather extremes.

* The World Bank's data (2024) reveals stark disparities across different regions of Sub-Saharan Africa.
* For example, in rural areas, only 36% have access to electricity compared to 59% in urban settings [VERIFY].
* Water scarcity and climate variability disproportionately affect marginalized communities who are less equipped to adapt.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Invest in infrastructure projects such as desalination plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and small-scale water treatment facilities to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Implement community-based water management initiatives that promote sustainable use of available resources.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**:
	* Support the development and deployment of off-grid renewable energy solutions like solar mini-grids in remote areas where grid extension is not feasible.
	* Encourage public-private partnerships to finance these projects, ensuring they reach underserved communities.
3. **Climate Resilience Measures**:
	* Implement early warning systems for droughts and floods using climate data from reliable sources such as NOAA (e.g., temperature anomalies).
	* Invest in climate-resilient agricultural practices that integrate drought-tolerant crops, improved irrigation techniques, and weather-resistant seeds.

## Implementation Considerations

* **Costs**:
	+ Desalination plant projects can range from $10 million to $50 million per facility, depending on scale and technology.
	+ Solar mini-grid installations in rural areas typically cost between $3,000 to $12,000 per installation unit [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* **Barriers**:
	+ Political resistance due to high upfront costs or perceived benefits not being immediately apparent.
	+ Limited financial resources for large-scale infrastructure projects.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation requires bold policy interventions backed by robust implementation plans. By prioritizing these areas, Sub-Saharan African countries can build more resilient societies that are better equipped to withstand future shocks. The time for action is now; failure to act will exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, leading to further suffering and economic stagnation.

## Call to Action

Encourage governments to allocate dedicated funds towards water security and renewable energy projects. Foster collaboration between public and private sectors to leverage resources effectively. Promote education campaigns that increase awareness about climate change impacts and adaptation strategies.
