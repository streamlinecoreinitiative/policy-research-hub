# Executive Summary

**Policy Brief on Environmental Resilience: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

To enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries, governments should prioritize investments in water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation. Specifically, we recommend investing $10 million to install rainwater harvesting infrastructure and desalination plants powered by solar energy in Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This intervention can improve living conditions while reducing economic burdens.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in securing water resources, ensuring reliable access to clean energy, and adapting to climate change impacts. According to World Bank data, Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind the world average with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This disparity exacerbates poverty and health issues.

Renewable energy consumption has increased globally, but it remains insufficient in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa where [VERIFY] % of the population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). This hinders economic growth and community development. The global population lacking safe water stands at 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO), highlighting the urgent need for climate-resilient infrastructure and practices.

## Analysis

### Water Security

In Sub-Saharan Africa, only a third of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, underscoring the critical need for innovative solutions such as rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants powered by renewable energy sources. According to World Bank data, freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of resources globally (World Bank Open Data).

### Clean Energy

The low electrification rate in Sub-Saharan Africa presents an opportunity for microgrids and solar-powered mini-grids that can be scaled up rapidly to provide reliable electricity to rural areas. Renewable energy consumption has increased globally, but it remains insufficient in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa where [VERIFY] % of the population relies on renewable energy (World Bank Open Data).

### Climate Adaptation

Interventions like climate-resilient irrigation systems, early warning systems for extreme weather events, and afforestation projects can enhance community resilience against climate-induced disasters.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security**:
	* Invest $10 million to install rainwater harvesting infrastructure and desalination plants powered by solar energy in Sub-Saharan Africa.
	* Implement subsidies or grants for households to install water-saving technologies like low-flow toilets and showerheads.
2. **Clean Energy**:
	* Prioritize microgrids and distributed renewable energy sources such as solar PV systems in remote areas where grid extension is not feasible.
	* Encourage private sector investment through tax incentives and public-private partnerships (PPPs).
3. **Climate Adaptation**:
	* Develop climate-resilient water management plans that incorporate traditional knowledge, modern technology, and community engagement.
	* Provide training for farmers on sustainable agriculture practices and provide them with drought-resistant crops.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Microgrid projects can range from $10,000 to $30,000 per installation (depending on scale). Solar-powered water harvesting plants may cost between $25,000 to $75,000.
- **Barriers**: Limited financial resources, lack of skilled labor, and resistance to change from traditional communities are potential hurdles. Address these through targeted investments in training programs and community mobilization efforts.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation is not only a matter of social justice but also an essential component of sustainable development for lower-income countries. By adopting the recommended policies and practices, governments can create resilient communities capable of thriving despite environmental challenges.
