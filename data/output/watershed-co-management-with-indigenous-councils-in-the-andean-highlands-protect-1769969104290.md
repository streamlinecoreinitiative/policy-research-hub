# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Andean highlands: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Andean Highlands: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental resilience issues, including inadequate access to safe drinking water and limited electricity. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, necessitating urgent policy interventions in water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation strategies.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to environmental stressors such as droughts, floods, and erratic weather patterns. The region's limited resources exacerbate these challenges, leading to poor water quality, inadequate electricity supplies, and increased risk from climate change impacts.

- Background: Sub-Saharan Africa has a population of over 1 billion people, with about [VERIFY] living in extreme poverty (2023 World Bank data)[7]. The region is characterized by arid and semi-arid climates, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change.
- Why it matters now: Climate change intensifies existing environmental stressors, making immediate action imperative. Sub-Saharan Africa's lack of access to safe drinking water and electricity compounds its vulnerability.

### Analysis

Current statistics show that only [VERIFY] of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water, while just over half have access to electricity. These numbers starkly highlight the region's inadequate infrastructure and resources.

- Water Security: With only [VERIFY] of the population having access to safe drinking water, Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant health risks from contaminated water sources.
- Clean Energy: Limited electricity access hinders economic development and quality of life improvements.
- Climate Adaptation: The region is highly susceptible to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, further complicating efforts to improve water security and provide clean energy.

### Policy Recommendations

To enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, the following specific actions should be taken:

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in sustainable water supply systems like boreholes and rainwater harvesting schemes that can be managed by local communities.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage decentralized renewable energy solutions such as solar-powered mini-grids for remote areas, which are more cost-effective and scalable compared to large-scale centralized systems.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Measures**: Invest in early warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure like flood barriers and water storage facilities to protect communities from natural disasters.

- Actionable Steps: Implement community-led projects that educate on hygiene practices and promote safe water use, while also providing solar-powered wells for improved access.
- Costs: Estimated cost of [VERIFY] per person for a borehole system. The cost of solar-powered mini-grids is approximately [VERIFY] per household.
- Potential Barriers: Political resistance to decentralization, limited financial resources, and technical expertise in implementing these solutions.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing the recommended policies requires careful planning and coordination. Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector partners is crucial for effective implementation. Public-private partnerships can leverage financial resources and innovative technologies while ensuring sustainability and scalability of projects.

- Costs: Estimated total investment of [VERIFY] to improve water security in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- Financial Resources Needed: Access to grants from international development agencies, concessional loans, and private sector investments.
- Potential Barriers: Political instability, corruption, lack of technical expertise, and community resistance.

### Conclusion

Enhancing environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa through improved access to safe drinking water, renewable energy provision, and climate adaptation measures is essential for sustainable development. By taking concrete steps now, we can build a more resilient future for the region's vulnerable populations.
- Call to Action: Governments, NGOs, and international organizations must collaborate to implement these recommendations, ensuring they are integrated into broader national development plans.
