# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and food insecurity due to droughts and rising temperatures. Implementing watershed co-management practices with indigenous councils can significantly enhance environmental resilience in this critical sector. This brief explores the potential of micro-hydro power systems for irrigation, a crucial component of sustainable agricultural practices in arid conditions.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity

The Lower Mekong delta is characterized by:

* Average annual rainfall: [Verification needed]
* Current irrigation practices' water usage efficiency: [Verification needed]
* The region's climate challenges and current water management issues are exacerbated by:
	+ Rising temperatures
	+ Decreased precipitation
	+ Increased evaporation due to changing weather patterns

## Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils: Enhancing Water Security through Micro-Hydro Power Systems

Micro-hydro power systems can:

* Improve irrigation efficiency and reliability, reducing water waste and increasing crop yields
* Provide clean energy for agricultural practices, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering emissions
* Foster community involvement in watershed management, promoting sustainable land use and water conservation practices

## Case Study Analysis: Successful Implementation of Micro-Hydro Power Systems
