# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Food Security During Droughts**

### Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a densely populated and ecologically sensitive region facing significant climate-related challenges, including rising temperatures, increased extreme weather events, and altered precipitation patterns. These changes exacerbate landslide risks, threatening the food security and livelihoods of millions.

### Introduction

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is critical for global food security, with approximately 150 million people dependent on agriculture and aquaculture. Climate change has intensified water scarcity, droughts, and landslides in the region, resulting in significant economic losses and displacement of communities.

### Current Water Security Challenges

*   **Water Scarcity:** The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces severe water scarcity due to climate change, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from vast wetlands.
*   **Traditional Irrigation Methods:** Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers in vulnerable communities.

### Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use. This integrated approach combines:

*   **Soil Health Benefits:** Improved soil structure and water retention capacity due to vegetation cover.
*   **Biodiversity Enhancement:** Increased biodiversity provides natural pest control and pollination services, reducing the need for chemical inputs.
*   **Economic Benefits:** Cost savings on labor, fertilizers, and other inputs due to enhanced soil health.

### Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of nature-based solutions in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta:

1.  **Subsidies and Grants:** Governments can provide subsidies or grants to support smallholder farmers in adopting these integrated systems.
2.  **Infrastructure Development:** Funding for infrastructure improvements is necessary to facilitate the implementation of these solutions (e.g., roads, electricity grids).
3.  **Sustainable Practices:** Policies promoting sustainable agricultural practices and renewable energy use can help ensure long-term sustainability.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a thorough assessment of the region's climate risks and vulnerabilities.
2.  Develop and implement policies supporting the adoption of nature-based solutions.
3.  Provide training and capacity-building programs for smallholder farmers on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
4.  Establish partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector organizations to support the implementation of these solutions.

### Closing Outlook

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical region that requires urgent attention to address climate-related challenges. By integrating nature-based solutions, including agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water security, reduce landslide risks, and stabilize food security during droughts.
