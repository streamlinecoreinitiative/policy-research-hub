**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, with rising sea levels, increased flooding, and saltwater intrusion affecting agriculture, fisheries, and human settlements. To address these challenges, we recommend prioritizing mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives that support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). [NEEDS SOURCE] By investing in mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance, we can enhance resilience against climate change impacts, improve living standards, and support sustainable development.

## Context & Challenge

The Lower Mekong delta is home to over 18 million people, with a growing population projected to reach 25 million by 2030 [1]. The region's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, fisheries, and tourism, which are all vulnerable to climate change impacts. Rising sea levels and increased flooding threaten the livelihoods of communities, while saltwater intrusion affects agricultural productivity and food security.

## Analysis

Mangrove forests play a critical role in protecting coastal ecosystems and supporting biodiversity. However, these forests have been degraded or cleared for aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development [2]. Blue carbon finance initiatives can support mangrove restoration by providing financial incentives to landowners and communities for preserving and restoring these ecosystems.

* **Access to safely managed drinking water (%)**: 32.4 (World Bank Open Data) [3]
* **Access to electricity (%)**: 53.3 (World Bank Open Data) [3]

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Invest in water infrastructure projects such as boreholes and rainwater harvesting systems.
	* Support community-led initiatives for water management and conservation.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**:
	* Increase investment in renewable energy sources like solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind turbines, and small hydroelectric plants.
	* Develop policies to support the adoption of electric vehicles and green buildings.
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**:
	* Develop comprehensive climate change adaptation plans that integrate early warning systems, disaster risk reduction measures, and resilient infrastructure designs.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Costs**: Initial investments in water security projects can range from $10,000 - $20,000 per borehole [4].
2. **Potential barriers**: Political resistance, low public awareness, and inadequate funding are common obstacles to implementation.

## Conclusion

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, with significant challenges in water security, electricity access, and climate adaptation. By prioritizing mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives, we can enhance resilience against climate change impacts, improve living standards, and support sustainable development. We recommend that governments, NGOs, and international partners work together to implement these policies and support the development of NDCs that prioritize adaptation targets.
