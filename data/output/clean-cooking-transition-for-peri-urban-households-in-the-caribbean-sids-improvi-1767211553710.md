# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Caribbean SIDS: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures and heatwaves posing health risks to peri-urban households. The transition to clean cooking practices is essential for improving indoor air quality and reducing respiratory diseases.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Challenges and Opportunities

### Water Security in Peri-Urban Areas

*   **Climate Change Impacts:** Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events exacerbate water scarcity.
*   **Water Loss Analysis:** Quantifying water lost through evaporation and seepage is crucial for identifying opportunities to improve irrigation efficiency.

### Clean Energy Solutions

*   **Renewable Energy Benefits:** Integrating renewable energy sources can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
*   **Micro-Hydro Systems:** Micro-hydro systems provide a reliable source of clean energy for irrigation and household needs.

### Climate Adaptation Strategies

*   **Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience:** Agroforestry practices enhance soil health, improve water retention capacity, and promote biodiversity.
*   **Community Engagement Strategies:** Engaging local communities is essential for ensuring long-term sustainability.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Subsidies and Grants:**
    *   Governments should consider providing subsidies or grants to support the adoption of sustainable energy solutions and water conservation practices.
2.  **Infrastructure Development:**
    *   Funding infrastructure improvements can facilitate the implementation of integrated systems.
3.  **Sustainable Practices:**
    *   Policymakers should advocate for policies promoting sustainable agricultural practices and renewable energy use.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a thorough analysis of water loss in peri-urban areas to identify opportunities for improvement.
2.  Develop and implement community-based initiatives to promote the adoption of clean cooking practices and sustainable energy solutions.
3.  Collaborate with local governments and stakeholders to develop policies supporting the transition to clean cooking and renewable energy.

## Closing Outlook

The Caribbean SIDS face unique challenges in addressing climate change, but integrating sustainable energy solutions with water security initiatives can provide a pathway towards environmental resilience. By prioritizing community engagement, policy support, and infrastructure development, we can ensure that these integrated systems are effective in improving health outcomes and reducing the burden of climate-related diseases.
