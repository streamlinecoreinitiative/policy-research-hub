# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Horn of Africa: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation in the Ethiopian Highlands**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa faces severe water scarcity due to climate change impacts, affecting agricultural productivity and food security. This brief proposes an integrated approach combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to address water scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands. The proposed solution aims to improve health outcomes during heatwaves by providing reliable irrigation for cash crops through renewable energy.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands**

The Ethiopian Highlands are characterized by high precipitation variability, with average annual rainfall ranging from 800-1200 mm (World Bank). Traditional irrigation methods suffer from high energy consumption and significant water losses due to evaporation and seepage. This results in a substantial economic burden for farmers.

**Section 2: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been recognized as an effective approach to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration (World Agroforestry Centre). Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for irrigation.

**Section 3: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems offer a renewable energy solution for irrigation, providing power generation of up to 50 kW per system. Energy efficiency ranges from 70-80% (World Bank). Compared to traditional irrigation methods, micro-hydro systems can reduce the economic burden on farmers.

**Section 4: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems provides a cost-effective and sustainable solution for addressing water scarcity. Estimated costs range from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare (verify). Long-term sustainability assessments are essential to ensure the continued effectiveness of these solutions.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Incentivize farmers through subsidies and low-interest loans for adopting integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop infrastructure, including roads and storage facilities, to support the implementation of micro-hydro systems.
3. Integrate micro-hydro systems into the national grid to ensure a stable energy supply.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed solution has the potential to address water scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands, improving health outcomes during heatwaves by providing reliable irrigation for cash crops through renewable energy. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these solutions.

**Key Data Points Needed:**

1. **NOAA Climate Dataset:** NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Ethiopia (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Local Surveys and Case Studies:** Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Long-Term Sustainability Assessments:** Specific data on long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions.

**Needed Evidence Snippets:**

- World Bank: electricity access (% of population, Sub-Saharan Africa, latest) [verify]
- World Bank: renewable energy consumption (% of TFEC, world, latest) [verify]
- NOAA climate (placeholder): Add NOAA dataset query with location + element (e.g., PRCP/TMAX) when network allowed.
