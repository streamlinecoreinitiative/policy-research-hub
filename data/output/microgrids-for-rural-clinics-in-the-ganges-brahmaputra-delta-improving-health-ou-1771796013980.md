# microgrids for rural clinics in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: improving health outcomes in heatwaves

**Strengthening Water Security, Renewable Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, electricity access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing investments in decentralized renewable energy solutions, particularly solar-powered mini-grids for rural clinics. This will not only improve health outcomes during heatwaves but also contribute to broader climate resilience efforts by reducing reliance on imported or unsustainable energy sources.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with severe challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024], while 53.3% have access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. These disparities threaten health and economic stability, particularly during heatwaves when temperatures often exceed 40°C (104°F) for several days.

### Analysis

The region's reliance on fossil fuels and inadequate water management infrastructure significantly contributes to these challenges. Water scarcity affects agricultural productivity, leading to food insecurity in many regions [Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022]. The UN SDG Report 2023 indicates that only 74% of the global population has access to safely managed water resources [Source: UN SDG Report 2023], leaving approximately 2.2 billion people without this basic necessity.

Electricity access is also patchy, with Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind other regions. Only 53.3% of its population enjoys electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. This disparity hinders socioeconomic development and exacerbates climate resilience issues. The region's renewable energy consumption stands at a mere 19.7%, far below global averages [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020], indicating underutilization of sustainable energy sources.

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Prioritize decentralized renewable energy solutions**: Governments should invest in solar-powered mini-grids for rural clinics to improve health outcomes during heatwaves.
2. **Enhance electricity access through grid extension and decentralized solutions**: Governments can explore solar-powered mini-grids and community-based solar installations that are more cost-effective and sustainable than traditional grid extensions in remote areas [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023].
3. **Promote renewable energy consumption**: Governments should introduce subsidies or incentives for renewable energy adoption to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels.
4. **Increase investment in water infrastructure projects**: Governments should prioritize investments in wells, boreholes, and rainwater harvesting systems to improve access to safe drinking water.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a collaborative effort involving multiple stakeholders including governments, NGOs, international organizations, and local communities. Cost estimates for water infrastructure projects range from $100-$500 per capita [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024], while solar-powered mini-grids can cost up to $3,000 per household [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. Subsidies and grants can mitigate these costs.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's water security, electricity access, and climate resilience are inextricably linked. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach that integrates decentralized renewable energy solutions, water infrastructure projects, and sustainable development strategies. By prioritizing equitable access to safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and clean energy sources, Sub-Saharan African countries can build more resilient communities better equipped to withstand climate-related shocks.

### Call to Action & Next Steps

Governments, NGOs, and international organizations must collaborate to implement the recommended policies. Initial steps should include comprehensive assessments of existing infrastructure, identifying gaps, and developing targeted interventions. Stakeholders should engage in public-private partnerships to leverage resources effectively. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation are essential to ensure that initiatives remain aligned with evolving needs and challenges.

By taking decisive action now, Sub-Saharan Africa can enhance its resilience, improve living standards, and secure a more sustainable future for generations to come.
