# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sahel: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sahel: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and resilient energy sources due to its resource constraints and climate variability. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in clean cooking, renewable energy, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Specifically, governments should implement subsidies or grants for clean cookstoves to reduce indoor air pollution and improve health outcomes [1]. Additionally, allocate funds towards renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind farms, to increase access to electricity while reducing carbon emissions.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately 850 million people, with vast geographic diversity and limited resources. Climate change exacerbates existing water scarcity and power shortages, leading to increased disease prevalence and economic instability [2]. The region lags behind other regions in access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), with renewable energy consumption remaining low at 9.2% of total final energy [3].

## Analysis

The data paints a stark picture:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally [1].
* Renewable energy consumption is just 9.2%, falling far short of global targets and exacerbating power shortages.
* Climate change is projected to increase water scarcity by up to 50% in some areas, further straining already limited resources [4].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Clean Cooking Transition**: Implement subsidies or grants for clean cookstoves to reduce indoor air pollution and improve health outcomes [1]. Estimated costs range from $20-$50 per unit [VERIFY].
2. **Renewable Energy Investment**: Allocate funds towards renewable energy projects, particularly solar and wind farms, to increase access to electricity while reducing carbon emissions. Costs can range between $1 million to $10 million per project, depending on scale and technology [3].
3. **Climate Resilient Infrastructure**: Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods to protect critical water infrastructure and ensure continued access to clean water.

## Implementation Considerations

To implement these recommendations, we suggest:

* Establish partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities to finance and implement renewable energy projects [3].
* Conduct pilot studies in rural areas to assess the feasibility of clean cooking solutions before scaling up.
* Allocate funding for climate-resilient infrastructure development.

## Conclusion

Governments must prioritize investments in clean cooking, renewable energy, and climate-resilient infrastructure to ensure sustainable development and protect public health. We urge policymakers to take immediate action to address these critical sectors and reduce emissions from irrigation practices in the Sahel region.
