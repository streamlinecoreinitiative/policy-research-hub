**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Filling Gaps for Sustainable Development**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. To address these issues, we recommend implementing policies that prioritize the construction of new water sources, rehabilitation of existing facilities, and efficient water distribution networks. Additionally, targeted electrification programs should be implemented for rural areas by providing subsidies or grants to households and small businesses. Finally, investment in renewable energy projects such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power is essential. By prioritizing these policies, we can ensure that future generations inherit healthier environments and more resilient societies.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries are disproportionately affected by water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts (World Bank Open Data). According to the World Bank, only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (2024) [1], while 73.7% of the global average lacks safe drinking water compared to the world average of 73.7% (2024) [2]. Furthermore, only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has electricity access (2023) [3], which is far below the world average of 91.6% (2023) [4]. The region relies heavily on fossil fuels for energy generation, contributing to high greenhouse gas emissions.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in water access due to inadequate infrastructure, limited funding, and poor governance (World Bank Open Data). Freshwater withdrawal accounts for 9.2% of the world's resources (2021) [5], highlighting the need for efficient use and management of this vital resource.

### Clean Energy Access

Only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has electricity access, which is far below the world average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data). The region relies heavily on fossil fuels for energy generation, contributing to high greenhouse gas emissions.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts are severe in this region, with frequent droughts and floods affecting agricultural productivity and water supply systems. Rising temperatures strain existing infrastructure, making it essential to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and adaptation measures.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Investment in Water Infrastructure**: Develop and implement policies that prioritize the construction of new water sources (pumps, wells), rehabilitation of existing facilities, and efficient water distribution networks.
2. **Electricity Access Programs**: Implement targeted electrification programs for rural areas by providing subsidies or grants to households and small businesses. Promote off-grid renewable energy solutions like solar home systems.
3. **Renewable Energy Development**: Encourage investment in renewable energy projects such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. Provide financial incentives, tax benefits, and favorable regulatory frameworks to accelerate deployment.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments for water infrastructure can be substantial but are expected to yield long-term savings through reduced health care costs related to contaminated water (World Bank Open Data). Potential barriers include limited funding, political will, technical expertise, and social acceptance of new technologies. Address these by leveraging international aid and partnerships with donor countries and multilateral organizations.

## Conclusion

Addressing the challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries requires a coordinated effort from governments, international partners, and local communities. By prioritizing sustainable development policies and investments, we can ensure that future generations inherit healthier environments and more resilient societies.
