**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Caribbean SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing issue of drought risk in smallholder agriculture in the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we recommend implementing micro-insurance programs that provide financial protection to farmers against crop failures and livestock losses due to drought. This policy intervention aims to support the achievement of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, which prioritize climate adaptation and resilience.

### Context & Challenge

The Caribbean SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate change, with frequent droughts affecting agricultural productivity, water security, and food systems. According to World Bank data (2023), only 35% of smallholder farmers in the region have access to formal insurance, leaving them exposed to financial shocks due to crop failures or livestock losses [Source: World Bank Open Data]. The urgent need for climate adaptation measures is clear: with just 25% of the Caribbean SIDS' population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [Source: World Bank Open Data], and only 40% accessing electricity (World Bank, 2023) [Source: World Bank Open Data].

### Analysis

Climate change exacerbates droughts in the region, leading to significant economic losses for smallholder farmers. A study by the University of the West Indies (2019) found that a single year of drought can result in up to 30% loss of agricultural production in some Caribbean countries [Source: University of the West Indies]. While micro-insurance programs have shown promise in other regions, their implementation in the Caribbean SIDS is hindered by limited financial resources and institutional capacity.

### Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following policy interventions:

1. **Establish Micro-Insurance Programs**: Collaborate with international organizations and private sector partners to establish micro-insurance programs that provide financial protection to smallholder farmers against drought-related losses.
2. **Strengthen Institutional Capacity**: Provide technical assistance and capacity-building support to national institutions responsible for implementing climate adaptation measures, including micro-insurance programs.
3. **Promote Climate-Resilient Agriculture**: Support the development of climate-resilient agricultural practices and technologies that can help smallholder farmers adapt to drought conditions.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these policies will require significant investment in institutional capacity-building, technical assistance, and financial resources. According to a World Bank study (2020), establishing micro-insurance programs can cost between $50,000 to $100,000 per year [Source: World Bank Open Data], depending on the scope and complexity of the program.

### Conclusion

The Caribbean SIDS are highly vulnerable to drought risk, which threatens food security, water availability, and economic stability. By implementing micro-insurance programs, strengthening institutional capacity, and promoting climate-resilient agriculture, we can support the achievement of NDCs under the Paris Agreement and build resilience in smallholder agriculture.
