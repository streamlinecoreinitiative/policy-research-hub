**Harnessing Renewable Energy for Water Security in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Pathway to Climate Resilience**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in electricity access and water security due to climate change, with only 53.3% of the population having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data). To combat this, we recommend prioritizing renewable energy investments and integrating them into national development plans by 2025. Developing a strategic plan with clear milestones for achieving SDG 7 (electricity) and SDG 6 (water) is crucial to ensure sustainable development and climate resilience.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa has low electricity access rates, particularly in rural areas, where only [VERIFY] % of the population has access to electricity. Climate change intensifies this challenge, with increased frequency of droughts and floods threatening water security, affecting agriculture, and public health. Immediate action is needed to ensure sustainable development and climate resilience.

## Analysis

Evidence shows that renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for only 19.7% of total final energy consumption globally (World Bank Open Data). The lack of electricity access leads to inefficient water management practices, contributing to pollution and poor sanitation conditions. Climate projections indicate a rise of +1.1°C by 2050, intensifying the challenges faced by communities.

## Policy Recommendations

### 1. Integrate Renewable Energy into National Development Plans

Governments should prioritize renewable energy investments in their national development plans, focusing on off-grid solar and wind power solutions (World Bank, 2023).

### 2. Promote Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)

Encourage collaboration between governments and private sector entities to fund and implement renewable energy projects (UNFCCC, 2024).

### 3. Invest in Smart Grids

Develop smart grid systems that can integrate renewable energy sources, ensuring more efficient distribution of electricity across the region (International Energy Agency, IEA, 2025).

## Implementation Considerations

Costs associated with initial investment and ongoing maintenance should be considered within national budgets. Potential barriers include political opposition to change and lack of technical expertise in rural areas.

## Conclusion

Implementing these recommendations will not only enhance climate resilience but also improve living standards for millions. By 2030, Sub-Saharan Africa aims to achieve at least [VERIFY] % electricity access through renewable energy solutions, significantly reducing poverty and improving health outcomes.

### Key Data Points

- **Sub-Saharan Africa Electricity Access (2023)**: Only 53.3% of the population has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).
- **Renewable Energy Consumption (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2020)**: Approximately 19.7% of total final energy consumption comes from renewable sources (World Bank Open Data).
- **Global Population Lacking Safe Water**: Over [VERIFY] billion people lack safe drinking water globally, with Sub-Saharan Africa being one of the hardest-hit regions (UN-Water/WHO).

### Additional Evidence Needed

- Detailed breakdowns of climate finance needs for Sub-Saharan African countries.
- Case studies demonstrating successful integration of renewable energy into national development plans in other developing regions.
