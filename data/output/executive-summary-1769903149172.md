**Boosting Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Comprehensive Approach**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief outlines a comprehensive approach to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our primary recommendation is to **accelerate the deployment of solar-powered wells** in peri-urban areas to improve access to safe drinking water. This intervention can be scaled up through partnerships with private sector companies. With an estimated cost of $3,000 to $8,000 per well [Source: SolarWells.org], this investment will pay off by reducing health issues and economic losses associated with limited access to safe drinking water.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces unprecedented challenges in water security, access to electricity, and climate adaptation. The region is the least electrified globally, with only 53.3% of its population having access to electricity in 2023 [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Water scarcity affects up to 80% of the population who rely on unsafe water sources [NEEDS SOURCE], leading to health issues and economic losses. Climate change intensifies these challenges, necessitating urgent action to enhance resilience.

## Analysis

Research indicates that access to safe drinking water is crucial for public health outcomes. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data], compared to 73.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data]. The region's high dependence on renewable energy consumption (9.2%) highlights its potential for sustainable development [Source: World Bank Open Data]. However, climate change impacts such as droughts and floods threaten water security and electricity supply.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Accelerate Solar-Powered Wells**: Implement solar-powered water wells in peri-urban areas to improve access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote Clean Cooking Solutions**: Invest in clean cooking solutions like biogas stoves and improved cookstoves, which reduce indoor air pollution and save energy costs for households [Source: WHO].
3. **Develop Solar Cold-Chain Systems**: Establish solar-powered cold-chain systems to preserve perishable fish along the coastlines of Sub-Saharan Africa, ensuring food safety and boosting regional economies.
4. **Support Agroforestry Value Chains**: Develop agroforestry value chains that integrate trees into agricultural practices for cash crops such as coffee or cocoa, enhancing soil health, carbon sequestration, and income stability.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementation of these recommendations will require significant investments in infrastructure development, technology transfer, and community engagement. Cost estimates for solar-powered wells range from $3,000 to $8,000 per well [Source: SolarWells.org]. Clean cooking solutions cost approximately $200-$400 each [Source: WHO]. Solar cold-chain systems can be initiated with initial investments of $100,000 for a small-scale system and scaling up from there. Agroforestry value chains require initial investment in research and pilot projects to demonstrate success before full scale-up.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience through targeted interventions is critical for Sub-Saharan Africa's sustainable development. By implementing the recommended policy actions, we can significantly improve living conditions while contributing to broader climate goals. Collaboration among stakeholders will be essential in realizing these transformative changes.
