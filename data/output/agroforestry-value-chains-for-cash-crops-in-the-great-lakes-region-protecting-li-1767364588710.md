# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Great Lakes region: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Great Lakes Region: Enhancing Water Security and Renewable Energy**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from wetlands. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers in vulnerable communities. This brief outlines a comprehensive approach to integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

**I. Introduction to Water Scarcity**

Climate change is affecting agriculture in the Great Lakes region through erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from wetlands, impacting water availability for crops. The region's traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, with significant economic costs associated with labor, maintenance, and fuel.

* **Water Scarcity Impacts:**
	+ Erratic rainfall patterns leading to crop failures
	+ Increased evaporation from wetlands reducing water availability for crops

**II. Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry plays a crucial role in enhancing climate resilience through improved soil health and biodiversity enhancement.

* **Soil Health Benefits:**
	+ Improved soil structure and water retention capacity due to vegetation cover
	+ Examples of successful agroforestry projects demonstrating improved water retention and reduced erosion (e.g., [Case Study 1], [Case Study 2])
* **Biodiversity Enhancement:**
	+ Increased biodiversity providing natural pest control and pollination services, reducing the need for chemical inputs

**III. Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology provides a renewable energy solution for irrigation efficiency.

* **Overview of Micro-Hydro Technology:**
	+ Explanation of the concept and benefits of micro-hydro systems in providing renewable energy
	+ Comparison of cost savings from reduced reliance on diesel generators [verify]
* **Energy Savings:**
	+ Examples of successful micro-hydro projects enhancing irrigation efficiency (e.g., [Pilot Project 1], [Pilot Project 2])

**IV. Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide a climate-resilient water supply solution.

* **Integrated Systems Implementation:**
	+ Description of pilot projects where agroforestry and micro-hydro systems are integrated
	+ Examples of successful integration projects demonstrating improved water security (e.g., [Pilot Project 1], [Pilot Project 2])
* **Economic Analysis:**
	+ Cost-benefit analysis showing the cost-effectiveness of these combined solutions [verify]
* **Community Engagement Strategies:**
	+ Proposal for engaging and educating local communities on the benefits of these integrated systems

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Governments should provide subsidies, grants, or low-interest loans to support adoption.
2. Infrastructure development is needed to facilitate the implementation of these solutions (e.g., roads, electricity grids).
3. Policies promoting sustainable agricultural practices and renewable energy use should be advocated for.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a climate-resilient water supply solution in the Great Lakes region. By leveraging the benefits of agroforestry and micro-hydro technology, this integrated solution can improve the resilience of agricultural practices in the region. It is essential to engage local communities and advocate for policies promoting sustainable agricultural practices and renewable energy use.

**Needed Evidence**

1. **Climate Data:**
	+ NOAA Climate Dataset for Specific Regions (Example Query: PRCP/TMAX for [Region Name] from 2015 to 2024)
2. **Economic Analysis:**
	+ Cost Estimates and Financial Viability Analysis (Example Dataset: AGO.ELC.ACCS.ZS, EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS)
3. **Socioeconomic Studies:**
	+ Local Surveys and Case Studies (Example Dataset: [Study Name] for the Central African Rainforest)

Changes made:

* Removed speculative claims that are not evidence-backed.
* Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
* Kept length similar.
* Preserved the title, which is specific to the outline.
