# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Resilient Water Security, Clean Energy, and Adaptation Initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa: Feasible Interventions for Sustainable Development**

## Executive Summary
To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $4.5 billion over the next five years to enhance resilience in secondary cities. This investment will focus on improving water infrastructure, promoting renewable energy adoption, and implementing climate-resilient programs.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant gaps in accessing safe drinking water (32.4%) compared to the global average of 73.7% [1]. Electricity access is even more limited with only 53.3% of the population having basic electricity services, a stark contrast from world averages at 91.6% [2]. These disparities not only threaten health and economic stability but also intensify climate vulnerability.

## Analysis
### Water Security

* Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in accessing safe drinking water, with only 32.4% of the population benefiting from it compared to a global average of 73.7% [1].
* The region's freshwater withdrawal is high at 9.2% of resources, highlighting the need for efficient use and conservation [3].

### Clean Energy Access

* Electricity access remains low, affecting economic productivity and public health.
* Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa stands at only 19.7%, far below global targets [4].
* This disparity necessitates more robust investment in clean energy infrastructure.

### Climate Adaptation

* Climate change impacts are severe, with frequent droughts and floods affecting millions.
* Enhancing resilience through better water management and renewable energy sources is essential for adapting to these changes.

## Policy Recommendations
1. **Investment in Water Infrastructure**:
	* Action: Increase funding for piped water connections, rainwater harvesting systems, and improved sanitation facilities.
	* Cost Estimate: $2 billion (based on successful projects in other regions).
	* Implementation Consideration: Collaborate with local communities to ensure sustainability and ownership.
2. **Renewable Energy Promotion**:
	* Action: Introduce policies promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro.
	* Cost Estimate: $1 billion (for small-scale projects).
	* Implementation Consideration: Provide subsidies for households and businesses to adopt clean energy solutions.
3. **Climate Resilience Programs**:
	* Action: Launch climate-resilient water security programs that integrate early warning systems, drought-resistant crops, and improved irrigation techniques.
	* Cost Estimate: $1.5 billion (for comprehensive implementation).
	* Implementation Consideration: Engage with local governments to tailor interventions for specific regions.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Funding**: Secure additional resources from international donors, multilateral agencies, and domestic budgets.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with NGOs, private sector entities, and academic institutions to leverage their expertise and networks.
- **Monitoring & Evaluation**: Establish robust monitoring systems to track progress and adapt interventions as necessary.

## Conclusion
Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation are severe but solvable. By implementing the recommended policies, decision-makers can significantly improve resilience and move closer towards achieving sustainable development goals. Stakeholders must work together to make these recommendations a reality for millions of vulnerable populations across Sub-Saharan Africa.
