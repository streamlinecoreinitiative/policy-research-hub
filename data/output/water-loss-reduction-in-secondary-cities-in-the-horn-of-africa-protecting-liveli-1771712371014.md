# water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Horn of Africa: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Horn of Africa: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

To address water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend integrating resilient water security measures with clean energy solutions. Specifically, decision-makers should prioritize investing in rainwater harvesting systems (Source: UN-Water/WHO) and small-scale irrigation projects (Source: World Bank) to ensure sustainable access to clean water. Additionally, promoting solar-powered desalination plants (Source: World Bank Open Data) and microgrids (Source: [NEEDS SOURCE]) can enhance power reliability during extreme weather events.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% access) and electricity (53.3%) ([VERIFY] Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024). These gaps exacerbate health risks and disrupt daily life during extreme weather events, such as droughts or power outages. The region is highly dependent on renewable energy consumption at [VERIFY] 19.7% (Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020), highlighting the need for further integration with water security measures.

## Analysis

Access to safe drinking water remains unmet in Sub-Saharan Africa, with only 32.4% of the population having access compared to a global average of [VERIFY] 73.7% (Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024). This disparity is compounded by energy poverty; despite having 53.3% electricity access, many communities lack reliable power sources, particularly during climate-related disruptions. Climate change intensifies these challenges, with an estimated [NEEDS SOURCE] 2.2 billion people globally lacking safe water (Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Integrate Resilient Water Security Measures**:
	* Implement rainwater harvesting systems in vulnerable areas to ensure sustainable access to clean water (Source: UN-Water/WHO).
	* Invest in small-scale irrigation projects for agricultural resilience, especially in arid regions (Source: World Bank).
2. **Promote Clean Energy Solutions**:
	* Encourage the deployment of solar-powered desalination plants to address freshwater scarcity (Source: World Bank Open Data).
	* Support microgrids and off-grid renewable energy systems to enhance power reliability during extreme weather events (Source: [NEEDS SOURCE]).

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: The initial investment in infrastructure could range from $1 million to $5 million per project, depending on scale and complexity.
- **Barriers**: Political resistance to change, lack of financing mechanisms, and technical expertise are potential hurdles. Addressing these through partnerships with international organizations and local stakeholders can mitigate risks.

## Conclusion

By adopting resilient water security measures and promoting clean energy solutions, Sub-Saharan Africa can significantly improve living conditions while contributing to global climate goals. Decision-makers should prioritize funding and policy support for these initiatives to ensure sustainable development in the region.
