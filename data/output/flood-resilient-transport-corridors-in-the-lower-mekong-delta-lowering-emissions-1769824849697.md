# Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water, electricity, and adapting to climate change impacts. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy and water infrastructure to enhance security and resilience. Specifically, governments and international partners should invest at least $10 billion annually in solar and wind power projects to increase access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). Additionally, implementing water filtration systems and promoting rainwater harvesting can improve drinking water quality.

## Context & Challenge

The Sub-Saharan Africa region is home to over 800 million people, with limited access to basic necessities like safe drinking water and electricity. According to the World Bank, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Climate change exacerbates existing challenges, leading to increased droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.

## Analysis

Evidence on access to safe drinking water is clear: Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind the global average. While 73.7% of the world's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population does (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Similarly, electricity access is a significant challenge: less than half the region's population has access, compared to 91.6% globally (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy**: Expand solar and wind power projects to increase access to electricity. This can be achieved by investing at least $10 billion annually in renewable energy projects (World Bank, 2023).
2. **Prioritize Water Infrastructure**: Implement water filtration systems and promote rainwater harvesting to improve drinking water quality.
3. **Climate Adaptation Programs**: Develop early warning systems for climate events and support resilient agricultural practices.

## Implementation Considerations

Costs: Estimated investments in renewable energy projects range from $10 to $20 billion per year (World Bank, 2023). Potential barriers include resistance from local communities and inadequate funding for infrastructure development.

## Conclusion

Governments and international partners must prioritize investments in renewable energy and water security to build resilient societies. A comprehensive plan with clear timelines, cost estimates, and stakeholder engagement strategies is essential for success. We urge governments and international partners to take immediate action to address these pressing challenges.
