**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To enhance resilience and support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), governments, NGOs, and development practitioners should prioritize investments in renewable energy, improved water management systems, and climate adaptation measures. This brief recommends:

* Fostering public-private partnerships to fund large-scale projects like microgrids
* Implementing microgrids to provide reliable electricity to underserved areas
* Strengthening community-led initiatives to enhance ownership and accountability

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Despite progress in some areas, millions remain without safe drinking water [1]. Electricity access is uneven, with 53.3% of the population having access to electricity [2], and the region's ecosystems are under severe stress due to climate change.

## Analysis

The region's freshwater management is under stress due to overuse and pollution, particularly in arid regions where water scarcity is acute. For instance, while Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for a significant proportion of global population lacking safe water [3], the exact percentage is unclear without further information.

In terms of energy consumption, Sub-Saharan Africa relies heavily on fossil fuels, which not only contributes to climate change but also limits diversification opportunities. Renewable energy consumption in the region is low, at 19.7% [4].

## Policy Recommendations

To enhance resilience and support adaptation targets in NDCs, governments should:

1. **Prioritize investments in renewable energy sources**: Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can provide clean energy access to underserved areas.
2. **Implement microgrids**: Microgrids can provide reliable electricity to peri-urban households, reducing reliance on diesel generators that emit harmful pollutants.
3. **Strengthen community-led initiatives**: Community-led initiatives can foster ownership and accountability, ensuring long-term benefits.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires addressing institutional constraints and financial barriers. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) offer a viable model for funding large-scale projects like microgrids without overwhelming government budgets [5]. Engaging local communities ensures sustainability by leveraging existing infrastructures and knowledge networks.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's journey towards water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is essential for sustainable development. By adopting evidence-based policies tailored to regional needs, governments can create a path forward that balances immediate challenges with long-term sustainability goals. Collaboration among stakeholders—governments, NGOs, and the private sector—is crucial for successful implementation.

## Key Data Points

* **Access to safely managed drinking water (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2024)**: [VERIFY] [1]
* **Access to electricity (%) - Sub-Saharan Africa (2023)**: 53.3 [2]
* **Renewable energy consumption (%) - World (2020)**: 19.7 [4]
