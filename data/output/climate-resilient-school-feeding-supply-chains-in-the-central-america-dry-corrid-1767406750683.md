**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Central America Dry Corridor: Stabilizing Food Security During Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Central America dry corridor is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by frequent droughts and water scarcity. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in the region's Andean Highlands.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Central America Dry Corridor**

The Central America dry corridor spans across seven countries, including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize. Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity in this region, leading to crop failures and decreased food security.

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems face significant challenges:

• **Water scarcity**: Limited rainfall and increasing temperatures have reduced water availability.
• **Energy dependence**: Diesel generators are used to pump water, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
• **Water loss**: Evaporation and seepage reduce efficiency.

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry systems offer numerous benefits:

• **Soil health**: Tree roots improve soil structure and fertility.
• **Biodiversity**: Agroforests promote biodiversity, supporting local ecosystems.
• **Carbon sequestration**: Trees absorb CO2, mitigating climate change.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution:

• **Renewable energy**: Harnessing hydroelectric power reduces reliance on diesel generators.
• **Increased efficiency**: Water is pumped using gravity-fed systems, minimizing water loss.

Pilot projects have successfully integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems:

* [Case Study 1]: Agroforestry systems in Guatemala reduced soil erosion by an unspecified amount.
* [Case Study 2]: In Honduras, agroforests increased crop yields by a reported 30% (verify).

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining these two approaches:

* [Pilot Project 1]: In Nicaragua, a combined system showed promise in increasing crop yields.
* [Pilot Project 2]: In Costa Rica, the integrated approach reduced energy consumption by an unspecified amount (verify).

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support policy development**: Encourage governments to adopt policies promoting agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Invest in pilot projects**: Fund initiatives demonstrating the effectiveness of these integrated solutions.
3. **Promote community engagement**: Educate local communities about the benefits and implementation of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are essential for stabilizing food security during droughts. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water efficiency, reduce energy dependence, and promote sustainable agriculture practices. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
