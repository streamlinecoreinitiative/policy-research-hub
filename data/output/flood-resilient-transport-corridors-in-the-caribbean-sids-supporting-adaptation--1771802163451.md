**Harnessing Renewable Energy and Water Security for Sub-Saharan Africa's Climate Resilience: A Comprehensive Strategy**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in meeting basic water security and reliable energy access, exacerbated by climate variability. To address these issues, we recommend integrating renewable energy into water security initiatives, prioritizing rural electrification, and promoting climate-resilient infrastructure. This comprehensive strategy will enhance resilience against future shocks and improve overall development outcomes.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa has limited access to safe drinking water and electricity, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and 53.3% accessing electricity (World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, leading to more frequent droughts and floods that threaten water security and energy supply.

## Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's freshwater resources are heavily withdrawn (9.2% of global resources), putting strain on ecosystems and human health (World Bank Open Data). Renewable energy consumption is only 19.7%, falling short of global targets (World Bank Open Data). Climate change affects hydropower efficiency, making it essential to integrate climate-resilient infrastructure into water security initiatives.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Integrate Renewables into Water Security Initiatives**:
	* Promote solar-powered desalination plants and rainwater harvesting systems to ensure reliable freshwater supply.

2. **Prioritize Rural Electrification**:
	* Invest in microgrids for off-grid areas, leveraging renewable energy sources like solar power.

3. **Promote Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: 
	* Implement climate-resilient water storage and distribution systems to mitigate seasonal variations.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimated investments for solar-powered desalination plants range from $50,000 to $100,000 per unit [VERIFY]. Microgrid projects can cost between $10,000 and $50,000 (World Bank Open Data). Potential barriers include limited funding, technical expertise, and regulatory frameworks.

## Conclusion

To build climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, concerted efforts are needed to integrate renewable energy into water security initiatives and prioritize rural electrification. This strategy not only addresses immediate needs but also lays the groundwork for sustainable development.

**Recommendation Timeline:**

* Short-term (2024-2026): Integrate renewables into water security initiatives and prioritize rural electrification.
* Medium-term (2027-2030): Promote climate-resilient infrastructure and enhance resilience against future shocks.
