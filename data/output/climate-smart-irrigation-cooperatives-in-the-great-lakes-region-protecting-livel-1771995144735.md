# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Great Lakes Region: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

**Executive Summary**

Lower-income countries in the Great Lakes region face significant challenges in ensuring access to clean water and electricity while mitigating the impacts of climate change. To address these pressing issues, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives that integrate water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies.

**Context & Challenge**

The Great Lakes region is home to approximately 400 million people who rely on agriculture as a primary source of livelihood (FAO, 2020). However, the region is experiencing increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods due to climate change, resulting in crop failures and water scarcity (IPCC, AR6).

**Analysis**

The current state of water security in lower-income countries is alarming. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). In Sub-Saharan Africa, this number rises to over 53% of the population without access to electricity (World Bank, 2023).

Renewable energy consumption in lower-income countries is also a significant concern. As of 2020, only 19.7% of total final energy consumption globally was derived from renewable sources (World Bank, 2020). Sub-Saharan Africa lags even further with just 5.3% of its electricity coming from renewables (World Bank, 2023).

Climate change poses a formidable threat to water security and energy access in lower-income countries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that global temperatures have risen approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial levels (IPCC, AR6).

**Policy Recommendations**

To address the water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges in lower-income countries, several policy interventions are recommended:

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Governments should provide funding and technical assistance to establish climate-smart irrigation cooperatives that integrate water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies (World Bank, 2023).
2. **Promote Renewable Energy**: Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources by subsidizing solar panels and wind turbines through tax incentives or grants. Governments should also invest in smart grid technologies to facilitate the integration of variable renewable energy sources into the national electricity grids (World Bank, 2023).
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**: Develop early warning systems and climate adaptation plans that integrate hydrological data from meteorological stations. This will enable timely responses to climate-related hazards such as floods and droughts (NOAA, 2024).

**Implementation Considerations**

Implementing these recommendations requires a coordinated effort at both national and local levels. Key challenges include budget constraints, limited technical expertise, and political resistance to change.

**Conclusion**

By focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation, lower-income countries can significantly improve the well-being of their citizens. The data clearly demonstrates that these areas are critical for sustainable development.

**Call to Action:** Immediate policy interventions must be prioritized to ensure equitable access to clean water and electricity while building climate resilience.

**Next Steps:**

1. Establish dedicated task forces within governments focused on water security, renewable energy, and climate adaptation.
2. Allocate adequate funding for these initiatives through existing budgets or external sources like international grants and loans.
3. Engage with local communities to ensure that their needs are addressed in project designs and implementation processes.
