# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in Caribbean SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, rising sea levels, and changing precipitation patterns. This brief focuses on the critical issue of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, with a specific emphasis on peri-urban households in Caribbean SIDS. The transition to clean cooking practices is essential for protecting livelihoods under climate stress.

## Main Sections

### Water Security and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries

Climate change poses significant challenges to water security in lower-income countries, particularly in regions like the Caribbean SIDS where water scarcity is already a pressing issue. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters exacerbate existing water management problems, threatening food security, human health, and economic development.

*   **Water Scarcity:** [Verify] average annual rainfall in the region.
*   **Climate Change Impacts:** Precipitation variability and increased frequency of droughts and floods further stress water resources.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation methods in the Caribbean SIDS are energy-intensive and economically burdensome, contributing to water loss through evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%). Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day, while canal systems suffer from significant water losses due to evaporation and seepage.

*   **Economic Impact:** The cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods is estimated at $[verify]-$[verify]/year.
*   **Energy Consumption:** Traditional irrigation practices rely heavily on fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbating climate change impacts.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it an essential component of climate-resilient water management strategies. Benefits include:

*   **Soil Organic Matter:** [Verify] increase in soil organic matter
*   **Biodiversity Increase:** [Verify] increase in biodiversity
*   **Carbon Sequestration:** [Verify] tons/ha/year

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. Key data points include:

*   **Power Generation:** 10-50 kW per system
*   **Energy Efficiency:** [Verify] energy efficiency
*   **Cost Savings:** Micro-hydro systems offer significant cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a cost-effective, sustainable solution for climate-resilient water supply. Key data points include:

*   **Total Project Cost:** $[verify]-$[verify] per hectare
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** [Verify] years
*   **Long-Term Sustainability Assessments:** Specific data on long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions.

## Actions/Recommendations

To support the transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households in Caribbean SIDS, we recommend:

1.  **Incentives for Farmers:** Provide subsidies and low-interest loans to farmers adopting agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Grid Integration:** Integrate micro-hydro systems with the grid to ensure a stable energy supply.
3.  **Infrastructure Development:** Develop infrastructure, including roads and storage facilities, to support the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households in Caribbean SIDS requires a comprehensive approach that addresses water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, and protect livelihoods under climate stress.

This brief provides a critical overview of the challenges facing peri-urban households in Caribbean SIDS and highlights the importance of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient water management. We hope that this information will inform policy decisions and support the development of sustainable solutions for these vulnerable communities.
