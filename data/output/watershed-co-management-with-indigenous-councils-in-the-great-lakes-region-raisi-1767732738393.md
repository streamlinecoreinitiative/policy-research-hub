# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Great Lakes Region: Enhancing Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

This brief focuses on enhancing environmental resilience in lower-income countries through integrated watershed co-management and indigenous council-led initiatives. The proposed approach combines agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate adaptation strategies to improve water security, clean energy access, and community livelihoods.

## Introduction

The Great Lakes region is characterized by severe water scarcity and climate change impacts on agriculture, affecting vulnerable communities' livelihoods. Traditional irrigation systems face high labor costs and fuel expenses, while agroforestry has demonstrated improved soil health benefits and biodiversity enhancement.

## Main Components

### 1. Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity

- **Climate Data:** NOAA Climate Dataset for Specific Regions (PRCP/TMAX).
- **Economic Analysis:** Cost Estimates and Financial Viability Analysis:
  - Access to electricity (% of population) and Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).

### 2. Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

- **Biodiversity Enhancement:** Increased biodiversity leading to natural pest control and pollination services.
- **Soil Health Benefits:** Improved soil structure with increased moisture retention.

### 3. Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency and Energy Savings

- **Overview of Micro-Hydro Technology:** Renewable energy source for irrigation systems (e.g., reduced diesel generator usage).
- **Energy Savings and Cost Reductions:**
  - [Verify] $10 per day savings from reduced reliance on diesel generators.

### 4. Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro

- **Integrated Systems Implementation:** Pilot projects showing increased crop yields.
- **Economic Benefits:**
  - [Verify] $50 per month savings over five years from reduced fuel and maintenance costs.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Subsidies and Grants:** Government subsidies for initial investment in micro-hydro system installation (amount to be determined).
2. **Infrastructure Development:** Community-led micro-hydro system installations with local government support.

## Future Research Directions

- **Long-term Sustainability Assessments:** 5-year monitoring period to ensure long-term benefits from integrated systems.
- **Community Engagement Strategies:** Participatory decision-making processes and joint decision-making committees involving farmers, government officials, and environmental experts.

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Support Indigenous Councils:** Provide subsidies and grants for initial investments in micro-hydro system installations.
2. **Develop Community-Led Infrastructure:** Establish community-led micro-hydro system installations with local government support.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience:** Implement agroforestry practices to improve soil health benefits and biodiversity enhancement.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Great Lakes region offers a promising approach for enhancing environmental resilience, improving water security, clean energy access, and community livelihoods. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with climate adaptation strategies, this project aims to increase resilience finance for vulnerable communities.
