# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sahel: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries: Bridging Gaps with Evidence-Based Solutions**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe water crisis, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). To address this challenge, we recommend investing in renewable energy for clean cooking and water treatment, promoting climate-resilient agriculture through agroforestry value chains that integrate climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, and implementing water loss reduction measures in secondary cities. By taking these evidence-based steps, governments, NGOs, and development practitioners can improve water security, enhance clean energy access, and support climate adaptation.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to over half a billion people who lack safe drinking water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). The current situation poses significant health risks due to contaminated water sources, exacerbating existing climate stressors and economic challenges. With only 53.3% of the population having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023), the region lags behind in renewable energy consumption at just [VERIFY] % globally (World Bank Open Data, 2020). This hinders efforts towards climate resilience and sustainable development.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), compared to 73.7% globally (World Bank Open Data, 2024). The region faces significant challenges in accessing clean water due to inadequate infrastructure and limited resources.

### Clean Energy Access

The region lags behind in renewable energy consumption at just [VERIFY] % globally (World Bank Open Data, 2020). This limits the ability to provide clean water through various technologies and hinders efforts towards climate resilience and sustainable development.

### Climate Adaptation

Rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall patterns threaten water resources and agricultural productivity, making adaptation strategies crucial for ensuring food security and livelihoods.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy for Clean Cooking and Water Treatment**: Implement solar-powered cooking stoves to reduce indoor air pollution and promote cleaner energy use. Invest in decentralized solar water treatment systems to improve access to clean drinking water.
2. **Climate-resilient Agriculture**: Promote agroforestry value chains that integrate climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, reducing dependency on rain-fed agriculture and enhancing soil health. Provide training for farmers on drought-resistant crop varieties and sustainable farming practices.
3. **Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities**: Develop comprehensive strategies to reduce water losses in secondary cities by implementing advanced metering systems and promoting efficient water use technologies like drip irrigation.

## Implementation Considerations

* Allocate budget specifically for renewable energy projects
* Engage local communities in planning processes
* Provide training programs for farmers on climate-resilient agriculture practices
* Implement cost-effective measures to reduce water losses in secondary cities

Investment in these initiatives would require significant upfront funding but yields substantial long-term benefits in terms of health improvements and economic growth.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe water crisis, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). To address this challenge, we recommend investing in renewable energy for clean cooking and water treatment, promoting climate-resilient agriculture through agroforestry value chains that integrate climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, and implementing water loss reduction measures in secondary cities. By taking these evidence-based steps, governments, NGOs, and development practitioners can improve water security, enhance clean energy access, and support climate adaptation.

Changes made:

* Flagged the renewable energy consumption percentage as "[VERIFY]" since it was not found in the research data.
* Added source citations where missing (e.g., World Bank Open Data, 2024).
* Removed clearly fabricated statistics (none found).
* Kept the title unless it's generic.
* Preserved the Policy Brief format.
