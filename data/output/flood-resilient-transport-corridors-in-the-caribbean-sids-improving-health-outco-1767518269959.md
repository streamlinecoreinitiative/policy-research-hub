# Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Caribbean SIDS: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are among the most vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and heat stress due to altered rainfall patterns. This brief focuses on flood-resilient transport corridors as a critical component of environmental resilience in these countries.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Key Challenges and Opportunities

### Water Security

*   Climate change is altering rainfall patterns, exacerbating water scarcity issues in lower-income countries.
*   Integrated agroforestry systems can provide a sustainable solution to irrigation needs while promoting soil health and biodiversity. [verify]

### Clean Energy

*   Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels.
*   Micro-hydro systems offer a reliable source of clean energy for irrigation and other applications.

### Climate Adaptation

*   Extreme weather events such as floods and heatwaves pose significant threats to human health and infrastructure in lower-income countries.
*   Flood-resilient transport corridors can reduce the risk of damage during extreme weather events while improving air quality and public health.

## Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors: A Case Study from the Caribbean SIDS

### Current Challenges

*   Existing transportation infrastructure in the Caribbean SIDS is often inadequate, with many roads and bridges vulnerable to flooding.
*   The lack of climate-resilient design and maintenance practices exacerbates these challenges.

### Opportunities for Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors

*   Integrated urban planning and transportation systems can reduce the risk of flooding while improving public health and economic competitiveness.
*   Climate-resilient infrastructure development should prioritize green infrastructure, including parks, green roofs, and rain gardens.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Integrate climate adaptation into national development plans** to ensure that infrastructure development is aligned with climate resilience goals.
2.  **Invest in green infrastructure**, such as parks and green roofs, to reduce the risk of flooding and improve air quality.
3.  **Develop capacity-building programs** for transportation officials and engineers to enhance their knowledge of flood-resilient design and maintenance practices.

## Closing Outlook

Flood-resilient transport corridors offer a critical opportunity for lower-income countries to improve health outcomes during heatwaves while enhancing the overall resilience of their infrastructure. By integrating sustainable infrastructure development with climate adaptation strategies, we can create more livable, resilient, and prosperous communities in the Caribbean SIDS and beyond.
