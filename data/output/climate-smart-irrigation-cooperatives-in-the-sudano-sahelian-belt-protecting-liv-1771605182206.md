# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief advocates for climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a critical intervention to enhance environmental resilience in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. With [VERIFY] 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacking access to safely managed drinking water, and [VERIFY] 53.3% without electricity (World Bank Open Data), our region is particularly vulnerable to climate stress. We recommend investing in community-based solar power projects and developing microgrid systems for rural clinics and schools. Additionally, we propose implementing early-warning systems for climate events and developing water resource management plans to ensure sustainable use of limited freshwater resources.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces unprecedented challenges related to water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change. Despite progress in some areas, millions remain without access to safe drinking water or reliable electricity (World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates these challenges through increased droughts and floods, threatening agriculture, livelihoods, and infrastructure.

According to the World Bank Open Data, only [VERIFY] 9.2% of freshwater resources are withdrawn sustainably worldwide. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this figure is even lower due to limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%). Climate change impacts are severe: droughts, floods, and extreme weather events threaten agriculture, livelihoods, and infrastructure.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water, leaving millions vulnerable to waterborne diseases (World Bank Open Data). This is a significant challenge for the region, particularly in areas with limited access to safe drinking water.

### Clean Energy

Electricity access remains low at [VERIFY] 53.3%, with only [VERIFY] 19.7% of total final energy consumption coming from renewable sources worldwide (World Bank Open Data). This limits economic opportunities and exacerbates health risks.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts are severe: droughts, floods, and extreme weather events threaten agriculture, livelihoods, and infrastructure. Implementing early-warning systems for climate events is crucial to mitigate these impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Safe Drinking Water Access**:
   - Expand water supply systems in underserved areas (e.g., boreholes, rainwater harvesting).
   - Invest in sanitation facilities to improve hygiene practices.

2. **Promote Renewable Energy and Microgrids**:
   - Implement community-based solar power projects.
   - Develop microgrid systems for rural clinics and schools (e.g., 100-300 kW capacity).

3. **Enhance Climate Resilience**:
   - Implement early-warning systems for climate events.
   - Develop water resource management plans to ensure sustainable use of limited freshwater resources.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Mobilize public-private partnerships and international development funds to finance projects.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local communities in maintenance, operation, and safety protocols.
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: Establish clear policies and standards for water supply and energy infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Enhancing environmental resilience through improved water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is vital for Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing targeted interventions and fostering robust partnerships, we can create a more sustainable and resilient future for the region's populations. Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives are a critical component of this effort, providing a model for community-led development that prioritizes water security, clean energy, and climate resilience.
