# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Indus Watershed: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant threats to food security, particularly in lower-income countries where communities rely heavily on agriculture for their livelihoods. The Indus watershed, spanning across Pakistan and India, is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into school feeding supply chains as a solution to address water scarcity and enhance climate resilience.

## Climate Change Impacts in the Indus Watershed

Climate change has severe implications for the Indus watershed, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns affecting agricultural productivity. The region experiences:

* [Verify] Average annual rainfall: 800-1200 mm
* Precipitation variability (annual range of 600-1400 mm)
* Water loss percentages from traditional irrigation systems:
	+ Evaporation: 30%
	+ Seepage: 5%

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Traditional irrigation methods in the Indus watershed are energy-intensive, with borehole pumps consuming [verify] kWh/day. Canal systems also experience significant water losses due to evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%). Local surveys indicate that community acceptance of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems is high.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

* [Verify] Soil organic matter: 2-8%
* Biodiversity increase: [verify]
* Carbon sequestration: [verify]

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions, with power generation ranging from 10-50 kW per system. Energy efficiency is estimated at [verify]%, and cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods are substantial.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a cost-effective, sustainable solution for climate-resilient water supply. Estimated costs range from $10,000-$25,000 per hectare, with a return on investment (ROI) of [verify] years.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains:

* Incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** to support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains.
2. **Establish partnerships** between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector organizations to facilitate the implementation of these solutions.
3. **Conduct further research** on the long-term sustainability and economic viability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Indus watershed require innovative solutions that address water scarcity and enhance climate resilience. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising approach to achieving these goals. By integrating these solutions into school feeding supply chains, communities can protect their livelihoods under climate stress and contribute to broader sustainable development objectives.
