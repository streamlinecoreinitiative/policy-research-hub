# Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

To ensure sustainable development and resilience in lower-income countries, governments must prioritize investments in clean energy sources like solar power and renewable technologies to address pressing issues of water scarcity, electricity shortages, and climate vulnerability. This policy brief recommends that governments expand access to solar-powered water pumps to increase safe drinking water availability in rural areas, invest in renewable energy projects such as wind and hydroelectric power to diversify the energy mix, and implement climate adaptation measures to enhance resilience against future shocks.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe water, electricity, and adapting to climate change impacts. According to World Bank data (2024), approximately [VERIFY] people globally lack access to safely managed drinking water, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for a significant proportion of this number ([NEEDS SOURCE]). In terms of energy access, only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan African households have access to electricity, compared to over 90% in developed regions [1].

## Analysis

Recent data from the World Bank indicates a gap of about [VERIFY]% in achieving SDG 6 targets globally [3]. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this figure drops significantly to around 32% [4]. The region's limited access to clean energy exacerbates existing challenges by hindering sustainable development. For instance, renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7%, far below the global average of 40% and a target set for 58% by 2025 [5].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Solar Power Access:** Governments should prioritize solar-powered water pumps to increase access to safe drinking water in rural areas where traditional infrastructure is inadequate.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs:** Initial costs for solar-powered water pumps may be significant, but long-term savings on maintenance and operation can offset these expenses. Renewable energy projects also carry upfront investment needs but offer substantial benefits in terms of reduced carbon emissions and improved public health.

- **Barriers:** Political will and financial resources are crucial for implementing these initiatives. Collaboration between government agencies, international organizations, and private sector partners can help overcome institutional constraints.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is imperative to ensure sustainable development in lower-income countries. By adopting the recommended policies and considerations outlined above, governments can make significant strides toward achieving SDG 6 and other critical environmental goals while fostering resilience against future shocks.
