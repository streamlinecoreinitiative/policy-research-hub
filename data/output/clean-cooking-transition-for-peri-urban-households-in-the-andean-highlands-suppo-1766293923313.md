# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

This brief focuses on supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by addressing clean cooking needs in peri-urban households of the Andean highlands. The transition to cleaner energy sources is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving local air quality.

## Main Sections

### 1. Introduction to Water Scarcity and Energy Needs in Peri-Urban Households of the Andean Highlands

The Andean highlands face significant water scarcity issues due to climate change impacts on rainfall patterns, affecting peri-urban households that rely heavily on wood fuel for cooking, leading to deforestation and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Current energy needs are met through a mix of diesel generators, solar panels, and traditional biomass-based systems.

### 2. Challenges in the Transition to Clean Energy

*   **Access barriers:** Limited access to clean energy technologies, high upfront costs, and lack of financing options hinder adoption.
*   **Social acceptance:** Community resistance to changes in cooking practices and concerns about affordability and reliability of new energy sources.
*   **Policy gaps:** Inadequate regulations and standards for clean cooking technologies, as well as insufficient incentives for households to transition.

### 3. Opportunities for Integrated Solutions

*   **Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems:** These integrated solutions can provide both clean energy and water security, addressing multiple development challenges.
*   **Community-led initiatives:** Empowering local communities to design and implement their own clean cooking transitions can increase adoption rates and ensure sustainability.

### 4. Policy Recommendations

1.  **Develop and enforce standards:** Establish clear regulations for clean cooking technologies, including safety and performance standards.
2.  **Provide financing mechanisms:** Offer accessible financing options for households to adopt clean energy solutions, such as subsidies or low-interest loans.
3.  **Support community-led initiatives:** Empower local communities to design and implement their own clean cooking transitions through capacity-building programs and grants.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Conduct a comprehensive assessment** of the current state of clean cooking in peri-urban households of the Andean highlands, including energy needs, access barriers, and social acceptance.
2.  Develop a policy framework that addresses the challenges outlined above, including standards for clean cooking technologies and financing mechanisms for households.
3.  Establish partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and local communities to support community-led initiatives and ensure sustainability.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to cleaner energy sources is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving local air quality in the Andean highlands. By addressing access barriers, social acceptance, and policy gaps, we can promote a clean cooking transition that supports adaptation targets in NDCs and contributes to sustainable development goals.
