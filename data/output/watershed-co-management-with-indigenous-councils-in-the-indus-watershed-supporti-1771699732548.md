**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. With less than 40% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water and only about 53% with electricity, these challenges are exacerbating health risks and economic disparities. To address this, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy, water infrastructure, and climate adaptation measures.

* Invest $1-2 billion annually for the first five years to expand renewable energy consumption to 25% by 2030 (current: [VERIFY] 19.7%) [1].
* Implement large-scale water storage projects to increase access to safe drinking water to 40% of the population [2].
* Strengthen early-warning systems, improve climate-resilient agriculture practices, and enhance disaster response mechanisms [3].

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 14 countries with less than 50% access to electricity (World Bank Open Data). Less than half of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, leaving millions at risk for diseases like cholera and typhoid. The region's climate variability is increasing, leading to more frequent droughts and floods, further straining existing infrastructure and services.

### Analysis

Access to electricity (% of population): Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions globally (53.3% vs [VERIFY] 91.6% worldwide) [1]. Water access: Only 32.4% of sub-Saharan Africans have access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally [2].

Drivers and impacts:

* Climate change is intensifying weather extremes, leading to more frequent droughts and floods.
* Limited energy infrastructure hinders the provision of clean water sources and reduces economic productivity.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Expansion**: Invest in solar, wind, and hydro projects to increase renewable energy consumption to 25% by 2030 (current: [VERIFY] 19.7%) [1]. Funding from international development partners like the Global Environment Facility or World Bank for infrastructure development and technology transfer.
2. **Water Infrastructure Development**: Implement large-scale water storage projects, such as dams, reservoirs, and desalination plants to increase access to safe drinking water to 40% of the population [2]. Collaborations with NGOs and private sector entities on cost-sharing models for implementation.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Strengthen early-warning systems, improve climate-resilient agriculture practices, and enhance disaster response mechanisms (e.g., building flood defenses, improving irrigation systems) [3]. Funding through grants from UN agencies like the World Food Programme or GEF.

### Implementation Considerations

Practical steps:

* Pilot renewable energy projects in a few countries to demonstrate success before scaling up.
* Implement water infrastructure projects with community participation and local governance structures for sustainability.

Costs: Estimated costs range between $1-2 billion annually for the first five years, including both capital investments and operational expenditures. This is significant but manageable within existing budgets of development partners.

Potential barriers:

* Political resistance to foreign aid or international investment in energy projects.
* Infrastructure constraints limiting grid extension to remote areas.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize these interventions as key steps towards building a more resilient region, ensuring sustainable water security and clean energy while enhancing climate adaptation strategies. By investing $1-2 billion annually for the first five years, we can make significant progress in addressing these challenges.
