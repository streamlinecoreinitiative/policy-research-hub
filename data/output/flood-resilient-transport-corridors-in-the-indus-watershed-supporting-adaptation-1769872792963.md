# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Indus watershed: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Pathway to Resilience**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend that governments invest in flood-resilient transport corridors in the Indus watershed. This initiative will not only enhance water security but also promote clean energy access and bolster climate resilience. Specifically, we suggest allocating resources to improve access to safe drinking water, expand grid infrastructure for electricity distribution, and develop early warning systems for droughts and floods.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, electricity access, and climate change adaptation. According to the World Bank (2024), only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data], compared to a global average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Similarly, just 53.3% of SSA's population has access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data], against the world average of 91.6% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. These disparities are exacerbated by climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, which further stress already limited resources.

## Analysis

The region’s inadequate water security is compounded by poor sanitation facilities and contaminated drinking water sources. According to the World Health Organization/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (WHO/UNICEF JMP), 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water [Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022]. In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, this figure rises to 38% of the population, with only 32.4% having such access [Source: World Bank Open Data].

Electricity access remains a significant challenge, particularly in remote regions. As of 2023, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 53.3% of the global population lacking access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data]. This is even more pronounced in rural areas where only 49.7% have access to electricity compared to urban areas with 61.2% coverage [Source: World Bank Open Data].

In terms of renewable energy consumption, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world average at just 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. This disparity is likely due to limited investment in renewable energy infrastructure and inadequate policy frameworks that support such investments.

Climate change further exacerbates these challenges by increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like droughts and floods. These events not only disrupt water supply systems but also lead to increased health risks related to contaminated water sources, malnutrition, and reduced agricultural productivity [Source: World Bank Open Data].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these issues, governments, NGOs, and international organizations should prioritize the following actionable steps:

1. **Invest in Water Security Initiatives:**
	* Improve Access to Safe Drinking Water: Governments should allocate more resources towards expanding water supply systems such as boreholes, pipelines, and rainwater harvesting systems.
	* Enhance Sanitation Facilities: Increase investment in sanitation facilities like latrines and septic tanks, especially in rural areas where access is limited.
	* Implement Sustainable Wastewater Management Programs: Develop comprehensive wastewater treatment programs to ensure safe disposal of human waste.

2. **Promote Clean Energy Access:**
	* Expand Grid Infrastructure: Invest in grid extension projects to improve electricity distribution networks, particularly in remote and underserved regions.
	* Develop Off-Grid Solutions: Support the deployment of solar-powered mini-grids, biogas plants, and micro-hydro systems for off-grid areas where connecting to the main power grid is not feasible.
	* Increase Renewable Energy Use: Encourage investment in renewable energy projects such as wind and solar power. Governments should provide subsidies or incentives for private sector involvement.

3. **Enhance Climate Resilience:**
	* Develop Early Warning Systems: Implement early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events to enable timely response and mitigation efforts.
	* Promote Agroforestry Practices: Support the adoption of agroforestry practices that help buffer against climate change impacts on agriculture. This includes planting trees in agricultural fields to provide shade, improve soil health, and protect crops from pests and diseases.
	* Support Climate-Smart Agriculture: Promote climate-smart agricultural techniques such as drought-resistant crop varieties, improved irrigation methods, and efficient use of fertilizers.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require a multi-faceted approach that involves collaboration between governments, NGOs, private sector entities, and international organizations. Key considerations include:

* Funding: Governments should allocate sufficient budget to support water security initiatives and clean energy projects. International financial institutions like the World Bank can provide additional funding through grants or concessional loans.
* Technological Solutions: Utilize advanced technologies such as satellite imagery for monitoring water sources, IoT devices for real-time data collection on renewable energy systems, and GIS tools for mapping climate vulnerability zones.
* Capacity Building: Train local communities in maintenance and repair of water supply infrastructure and clean energy systems. Establish training programs to build the capacity of local technicians and engineers.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders. By implementing the recommended policy measures, governments can significantly improve living conditions for their populations while fostering sustainable development. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are essential to ensure that these interventions are effective and responsive to changing needs.
