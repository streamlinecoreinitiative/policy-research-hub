# early-warning systems and last-mile alerts in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Strengthening Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity, exacerbating climate vulnerabilities. To address this, we recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy, infrastructure upgrades for water security, and early warning systems to support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Specifically, we urge governments, NGOs, and international partners to:

* Increase investment in solar and wind projects to meet electricity needs while reducing carbon emissions
* Implement large-scale water storage facilities, desalination plants, and sustainable irrigation systems to improve access to clean water
* Develop early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events using satellite data and local knowledge

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to over half a billion people who lack access to safe drinking water (2.2 billion globally) [1]. Climate change impacts, such as droughts and floods, threaten agricultural productivity, leading to food insecurity [2]. The energy crisis in the region is particularly acute, with only 53.3% of the population having access to electricity, limiting economic development [3].

### Analysis

Water Security: Access to clean water is a critical issue; Sub-Saharan Africa only achieves 32.4% safe drinking water coverage (World Bank, 2024) [1]. This is significantly lower than the global average of 73.7% [4].

Clean Energy: Despite global trends favoring renewables, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 19.7% of its energy consumption coming from renewable sources (World Bank, 2020) [5].

Climate Adaptation: Vulnerability to climate change impacts has increased due to insufficient adaptation measures.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Focus**: Increase investment in solar and wind projects to meet electricity needs while reducing carbon emissions. By 2025, aim for at least 30% of the region's energy consumption to come from renewable sources.
2. **Water Infrastructure Upgrades**: Implement large-scale water storage facilities, desalination plants, and sustainable irrigation systems to improve access to clean water. By 2027, target a minimum of 50% safe drinking water coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa.
3. **Early Warning Systems**: Develop early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events using satellite data and local knowledge. By 2026, establish at least three regional hubs for knowledge sharing and best practices.

### Implementation Considerations

Funding: Mobilize public-private partnerships with grants from international development banks and philanthropic organizations to support the implementation of these recommendations.

Capacity Building: Train local communities in renewable energy installation and maintenance to ensure sustainable project operation.

Monitoring & Evaluation: Establish robust monitoring systems to track progress, address challenges, and adjust strategies as needed.

### Conclusion

Governments, NGOs, and international partners must collaborate to implement these recommendations within the next two years to achieve SDG 6 (Water) targets in Sub-Saharan Africa. A comprehensive roadmap with specific milestones and timelines for implementation should be developed, along with regional hubs for knowledge sharing and best practices.
