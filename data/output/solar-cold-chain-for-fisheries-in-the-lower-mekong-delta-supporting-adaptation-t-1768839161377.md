# Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to fisheries and aquaculture in the Lower Mekong Delta, particularly in terms of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. This brief explores the potential of solar cold-chain systems as a sustainable solution for supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By integrating renewable energy with efficient cold storage, fisheries can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, minimize waste, and improve food safety while adapting to changing environmental conditions.

## Main Sections

### Water Security and Clean Energy

The Lower Mekong Delta is vulnerable to climate-related water scarcity, flooding, and saltwater intrusion. Solar-powered cold-chain systems can help mitigate these impacts by providing a reliable source of clean energy for cooling and refrigeration. This approach reduces the reliance on diesel generators, minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Reduced energy costs
    *   Lower carbon footprint
    *   Improved air quality
*   **Needed Evidence:** Data on local solar irradiance levels, energy consumption patterns, and economic benefits of solar-powered cold-chain systems in similar regions

### Climate Adaptation through Solar Cold-Chain Systems

Solar cold-chain systems can help fisheries adapt to changing environmental conditions by providing a flexible and resilient cooling solution. This approach enables fishermen and aquaculture operators to maintain product quality during periods of extreme weather or water scarcity.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improved food safety
    *   Reduced waste
    *   Increased resilience to climate-related shocks
*   **Needed Evidence:** Case studies on the effectiveness of solar cold-chain systems in similar regions, including data on energy savings and economic benefits

### Integration with NDCs

Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) outline countries' commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. Solar cold-chain systems can support these targets by providing a clean energy solution for fisheries and aquaculture.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Alignment with NDCs
    *   Contribution to sustainable development goals
    *   Support for local economic development
*   **Needed Evidence:** Data on the alignment of solar cold-chain systems with national climate policies and strategies

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a feasibility study to assess the potential of solar cold-chain systems in the Lower Mekong Delta.
2.  Develop a business model that integrates solar-powered cold-chain systems with existing fisheries and aquaculture operations.
3.  Establish partnerships with local stakeholders, including government agencies, private sector companies, and community organizations, to support the adoption of solar cold-chain systems.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of solar cold-chain systems can provide a sustainable solution for supporting adaptation targets in NDCs while addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation challenges in the Lower Mekong Delta. By leveraging renewable energy and efficient cooling technologies, fisheries and aquaculture operators can reduce their environmental footprint, improve food safety, and increase resilience to climate-related shocks.
