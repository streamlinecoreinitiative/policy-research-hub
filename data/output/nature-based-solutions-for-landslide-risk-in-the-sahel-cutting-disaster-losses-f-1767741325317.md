# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sahel: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sahel: Enhancing Climate Resilience**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region is highly vulnerable to landslides, which have devastating impacts on local communities and economies. Climate change exacerbates these risks through increased rainfall intensity and frequency. This brief proposes an integrated approach to address landslide risk using nature-based solutions (NBS).

**I. Introduction to Landslide Risk in the Sahel**

* The Sahel region spans across several countries in West Africa, including Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Chad.
* Climate change contributes to increased rainfall intensity and frequency, leading to landslides that destroy homes, infrastructure, and agricultural land.
* Existing irrigation systems often rely on inefficient methods with high water loss percentages ([verify] e.g., evaporation and seepage).

**II. Current Practices and Challenges**

* Traditional farming practices in the Sahel region lead to soil erosion and decreased fertility.
* Existing irrigation systems rely heavily on diesel generators, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
* Water scarcity and inefficient irrigation systems exacerbate poverty and food insecurity.

**III. Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk Reduction**

* Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration in the Sahel region ([Case Study 1], [Case Study 2]).
* Micro-hydro systems can provide clean energy for irrigation.
* Integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can enhance water retention, reduce erosion, and increase climate resilience.

**IV. Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

* Governments should invest in subsidies, low-interest loans, and infrastructure development to support adoption at scale.
* Further research is needed to understand the economic impact, community engagement, and scalability of NBS for landslide risk reduction.
* International cooperation and knowledge sharing are essential to develop effective policies and strategies.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop a Sahel-specific policy framework** that supports the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation.
2. **Invest in pilot projects** to demonstrate the effectiveness of NBS for landslide risk reduction and climate adaptation.
3. **Establish a regional knowledge-sharing platform** to facilitate collaboration among governments, researchers, and practitioners.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sahel region can benefit from an integrated approach to address landslide risk using nature-based solutions. By investing in agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote climate resilience. This brief provides a starting point for policy development and future research directions.

Changes made:

* Removed speculative claim about "30% evaporation, 5% seepage" as it lacks source.
* Replaced generic title with a more specific one consistent with the outline.
* Flagged number in II. Current Practices and Challenges as "[verify]" to indicate lack of source.
* Preserved length and structure while tightening language for clarity.
