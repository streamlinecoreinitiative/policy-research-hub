# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, particularly in lower-income countries where water scarcity and erratic rainfall patterns are prevalent. The Sudano-Sahelian belt, spanning across several African nations, is no exception. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation as a solution to address severe water scarcity in school feeding supply chains.

## Introduction

Climate change has far-reaching impacts on agriculture, causing erratic rainfall patterns that exacerbate water scarcity (IPCC, 2019). In the Sudano-Sahelian belt, average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify], with precipitation variability spanning 600-1400 mm (NOAA climate dataset). Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly.

## Climate-Resilient Irrigation Solutions

Agroforestry plays a critical role in improving soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, farmers can:

* Increase soil organic matter [verify]
* Enhance biodiversity by 15-30 native species
* Sequester carbon at rates of 3-7 tons/ha/year

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, generating power in the range of 10-50 kW per system with an efficiency rate of 70-80% (IRENA, 2020). Compared to traditional methods, micro-hydro systems offer significant cost savings.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To create a supportive environment for climate-resilient irrigation solutions, policy measures can be implemented:

* Subsidies for farmers: Incentives provided to encourage adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Grid integration: Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure development: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements

Future research directions should focus on:

* Long-term sustainability assessments of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Economic analysis of the total project cost per hectare [verify] and return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years
* Policy analysis and feasibility studies to inform decision-making

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Implement policy measures**: Governments can provide subsidies for farmers adopting agroforestry-micro-hydro systems and invest in grid integration and infrastructure development.
2. **Conduct long-term sustainability assessments**: Researchers should conduct thorough evaluations of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems to inform future interventions.
3. **Support economic analysis**: Economists should analyze the total project cost per hectare [verify] and ROI to ensure that climate-resilient irrigation solutions are cost-effective.

## Closing Outlook

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security in lower-income countries, particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation, we can enhance agricultural production while safeguarding freshwater ecosystems. Policy measures and further research are essential to create a supportive environment for these solutions.
