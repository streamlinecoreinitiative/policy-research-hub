# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Food Security during Droughts

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces severe water scarcity challenges due to climate change, population growth, and unsustainable agricultural practices. This brief explores the potential of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a solution to stabilize food security during droughts in the region.

## Water Security Challenges in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is characterized by:

*   **Severe water scarcity**: Limited access to clean water, particularly for irrigation and drinking purposes.
*   **Climate change impacts**: Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events.
*   **Population growth**: Rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion leading to increased demand for water resources.
*   **Socio-economic factors**: Limited economic opportunities, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of access to modern irrigation systems.

## Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Solution for Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution to address the region's water scarcity challenges. These systems:

*   **Integrate agroforestry practices**: Enhance soil fertility, improve water retention, and promote biodiversity.
*   **Harness renewable energy**: Micro-hydro technology provides clean energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change impacts.
*   **Improve water management**: Efficient use of water resources through integrated approaches to irrigation.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To scale up watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta:

1.  **Support policy reforms**: Encourage governments to adopt policies promoting agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Capacity building**: Provide training and technical assistance to indigenous councils on watershed management and micro-hydro system design.
3.  **Community engagement**: Foster partnerships between local communities, NGOs, and private sector organizations to implement these solutions.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta offers a promising approach to stabilize food security during droughts. By integrating agroforestry practices and micro-hydro systems, this solution can enhance water management efficiency, promote renewable energy use, and support climate resilience. Further research is needed to refine system design, improve cost-effectiveness, and scale up implementation.
