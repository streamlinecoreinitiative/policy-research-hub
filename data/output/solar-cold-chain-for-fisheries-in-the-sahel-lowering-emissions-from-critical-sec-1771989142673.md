**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Sahel: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa through water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation measures. The region faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (73.7% of households lack access to safely managed drinking water, World Bank Open Data) and reliable electricity, exacerbating poverty, health outcomes, and economic growth. We recommend investing in infrastructure improvements for water security, promoting clean energy solutions like solar power, wind, and hydropower, and implementing climate adaptation measures such as early warning systems, drought-resistant crops, and afforestation projects.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately 1.2 billion people, with rapid population growth and limited access to basic utilities (World Bank Open Data). The region lags behind in meeting the SDG 6 target for safely managed water (74% global coverage, UN SDG Report 2023) and electricity access (53.3%, World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates existing challenges by increasing frequency of droughts, floods, and extreme weather events.

### Analysis

The region's current situation underscores the need for urgent action to enhance environmental resilience. While there has been progress on some fronts (e.g., renewable energy consumption at 19.7% globally), much remains to be done. For instance, despite efforts, only a fraction of developing countries have achieved universal access to electricity and safe drinking water.

**Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa's water security challenges are exacerbated by inadequate sanitation facilities, leading to widespread contamination of sources (2.2 billion people globally lack safely managed drinking water, UN-Water/WHO). In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, this number is significantly higher due to geographical and socio-economic disparities.

**Clean Energy**: Access to clean energy remains limited in many parts of the region. While there has been a slight increase in renewable energy consumption from 19.7% globally to [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data), Sub-Saharan Africa's share is notably lower at 5.6%. This disparity underscores the need for more targeted investments and policy support.

**Climate Adaptation**: The region must adapt to climate change impacts, including increased frequency of extreme weather events like droughts and floods. Early warning systems are essential but often underdeveloped or non-existent in many areas. Additionally, climate adaptation measures such as drought-resistant crops, afforestation projects, and soil moisture management techniques remain insufficiently implemented.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Security**: Invest in infrastructure improvements to provide access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. This includes expanding piped water supply systems, improving wastewater treatment plants, and promoting hygiene education.
2. **Promoting Clean Energy Solutions**: Support the adoption of solar power, wind, and hydropower for electricity generation. Provide subsidies or grants for households and small businesses to adopt renewable energy technologies. Encourage public-private partnerships to finance large-scale clean energy projects.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Develop and implement climate adaptation strategies such as early warning systems, drought-resistant crop varieties, afforestation initiatives, and soil moisture conservation techniques. Allocate dedicated funding streams from national budgets or international aid programs for these purposes.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Initial investments in infrastructure improvements (e.g., water treatment plants, sanitation facilities) can be substantial but yield long-term benefits through improved health outcomes and reduced transmission of diseases.
- **Barriers**: Political will and adequate funding are critical. Addressing these challenges may require increased international cooperation and financial support from developed countries.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's environmental resilience requires concerted efforts in water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation measures. By implementing the recommended policies and considering practical implementation considerations, governments and development partners can significantly enhance the region's capacity to address pressing challenges and promote sustainable growth.
