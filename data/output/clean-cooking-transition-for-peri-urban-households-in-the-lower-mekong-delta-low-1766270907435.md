# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong delta region faces rapid urbanization and growing energy demands, leading to increased emissions from traditional cooking practices. This brief highlights the importance of transitioning peri-urban households to cleaner cooking methods, focusing on water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

## I. Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Delta

The Lower Mekong delta is a critical region for agriculture, with approximately 70% of its population relying on irrigation systems (World Bank). Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity issues, with erratic rainfall patterns and rising temperatures affecting crop yields and food security.

### Key Challenges:

*   **Water Scarcity:** Insufficient water resources for agricultural purposes
*   **Climate Change:** Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns impacting agriculture
*   **Food Security:** Vulnerability of the region's population to climate-related shocks

## II. Current Cooking Practices and Emissions

Peri-urban households in the Lower Mekong delta primarily rely on traditional cooking methods, such as charcoal and wood-fired stoves, which contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.

### Key Statistics:

*   **Emissions:** Traditional cooking practices emit approximately [verify] tons of CO2 equivalent per household annually
*   **Health Impacts:** Indoor air pollution from biomass fuels affects the health of over 50% of peri-urban households

## III. Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate Resilience

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution to address water scarcity, climate change, and energy needs.

### Key Benefits:

*   **Water Retention:** Agroforestry practices improve soil health and increase water retention
*   **Energy Efficiency:** Micro-hydro systems reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency

## IV. Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient water supply.

### Key Outcomes:

*   **Water Savings:** Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems reduce water loss through evaporation and seepage
*   **Energy Efficiency:** Micro-hydro systems provide a reliable source of energy, reducing reliance on diesel generators

## V. Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale, policy recommendations include:

### Key Actions:

*   **Policy Support:** Governments should provide incentives for the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
*   **Capacity Building:** Training programs should be established to enhance the skills of farmers and technicians in implementing these systems

## VI. Closing Outlook

The transition to cleaner cooking methods, water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation is crucial for peri-urban households in the Lower Mekong delta. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can create a more resilient and sustainable future for this region.

### Key Takeaways:

*   **Water Scarcity:** Addressing water scarcity through integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
*   **Climate Change:** Mitigating climate change impacts on agriculture and food security
*   **Clean Energy:** Promoting the use of renewable energy sources for cooking and irrigation purposes
