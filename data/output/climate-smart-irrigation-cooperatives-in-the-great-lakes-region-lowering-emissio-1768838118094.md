# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Great Lakes Region: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

### Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region faces severe water scarcity due to climate change impacts on agriculture. This brief presents an integrated solution combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to address water scarcity and promote climate resilience.

### Addressing Water Scarcity through Climate-Smart Irrigation

#### Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change affects agriculture by causing erratic rainfall patterns, affecting crop yields and water availability. In the Great Lakes region, average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify], with precipitation variability between 600-1400 mm (NOAA climate dataset). This highlights the need for innovative solutions to address severe water scarcity.

#### Current Irrigation Practices

Traditional irrigation methods in the region are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy, while canal systems experience losses due to evaporation and seepage [verify]. These inefficiencies contribute to greenhouse gas emissions from critical sectors.

#### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Local surveys and case studies demonstrate the benefits of agroforestry on soil organic matter, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration [verify].

#### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy. Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system, with energy efficiency at 70-80% [verify]. Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods are significant.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

#### Rationale

Integrated solutions can provide cost-effective outcomes for climate-resilient water supply. The total project cost per hectare is estimated at $10,000-$25,000 [verify], with a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

#### Subsidies for Farmers

Incentives should be provided to encourage adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. This can include subsidies for farmers or tax breaks for investments in climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure.

#### Grid Integration

Grid integration with micro-hydro systems can enhance reliability and efficiency. Policy measures should support grid connection and ensure fair compensation for renewable energy producers.

#### Infrastructure Development

Infrastructure development, such as roads and storage facilities, is crucial for the long-term sustainability of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Policy measures should prioritize infrastructure investments in rural areas.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1.  Conduct a thorough assessment of water scarcity and climate change impacts on agriculture in the Great Lakes region.
2.  Develop a comprehensive policy framework to support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  Establish partnerships between governments, farmers, and private sector entities to promote the integrated solution.

### Closing Outlook

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives have the potential to address severe water scarcity in lower-income countries while promoting climate resilience and sustainable development. By leveraging existing research and best practices from similar regions, we can develop cost-effective solutions for irrigation efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from critical sectors.
