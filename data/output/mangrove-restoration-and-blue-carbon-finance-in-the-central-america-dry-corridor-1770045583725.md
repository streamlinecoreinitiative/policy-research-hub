**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Central America Dry Corridor: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issues of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance initiatives. These efforts can help reduce disaster losses and enhance livelihoods for vulnerable communities. Specifically, we propose:

* Expanding renewable energy deployment to meet electricity demands sustainably
* Investing in water supply infrastructure to improve access to safe drinking water
* Enhancing early warning systems for climate-related disasters

These interventions are crucial due to the region's 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024) and only 53.3% of its population having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023).

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental challenges, including water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. The region's context is characterized by widespread poverty, limited resources, and the impact of climate change exacerbating existing challenges. With [VERIFY] access to safely managed drinking water worldwide (World Bank Open Data, 2024) but only 32.4% in this region, ensuring universal access remains a critical challenge.

## Analysis

Research indicates that approximately 2.2 billion people globally lack access to safe water, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for approximately half of this population gap at [VERIFY] individuals (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). In terms of energy consumption, renewable sources account for only 19.7% of total final energy consumption worldwide (World Bank Open Data, 2020), underscoring the need for greater investment in clean and sustainable energy solutions.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we propose the following policy recommendations:

1. **Expand Renewable Energy Deployment**: Governments should prioritize the development and deployment of renewable energy sources to meet electricity demands sustainably. Policies such as feed-in tariffs and subsidies for solar, wind, and hydro power can incentivize private sector investments.
2. **Invest in Water Supply Infrastructure**: Significant investments are needed in water supply projects like boreholes, pipelines, and storage facilities to improve access to safe drinking water. Targeted grants and loans from international development banks could support these initiatives.
3. **Enhance Early Warning Systems**: Establishing robust early warning systems for climate-related disasters can enable timely responses, thereby reducing loss of life and property damage. Collaboration with local communities is essential in developing effective early warning mechanisms.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require careful planning to ensure sustainability and cost-effectiveness. For example:

* **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Conduct detailed cost-benefit analyses for each proposed project to justify funding.
* **Community Engagement**: Engage local communities in the decision-making process to build trust and ensure long-term maintenance of infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Enhancing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted efforts from governments, NGOs, and international partners. By adopting these evidence-based recommendations, stakeholders can make significant strides towards creating a more resilient future for the region.

**Call to Action**: Encourage policy makers and development practitioners to prioritize funding and resources for water supply infrastructure improvements, renewable energy projects, and climate adaptation measures.
