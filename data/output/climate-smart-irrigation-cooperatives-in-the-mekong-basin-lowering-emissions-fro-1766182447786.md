# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Mekong basin: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Mekong Delta faces significant water scarcity challenges due to climate change, threatening millions of people who depend on agriculture and fishing. This brief explores a sustainable solution that integrates agroforestry with wind-powered desalination systems to enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

**Climate Change Impacts on the Mekong Delta**

The Mekong Delta is one of the world's most productive agricultural regions, providing a significant portion of Vietnam's rice production [verify]. Climate change is having a devastating impact on agriculture in the region, with rising sea levels and increased salinity intrusion reducing crop yields, while more frequent floods and droughts disrupt water availability.

**Current Desalination Practices and Challenges**

Existing desalination technologies rely heavily on non-renewable energy sources and have significant environmental impacts. A study in the Mekong Delta found that traditional desalination systems can be inefficient, but specific data on water loss is not available [verify]. These systems require high maintenance costs and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it an essential component of climate-resilient agriculture. In the Mekong Delta, agroforestry systems have been found to retain more water than conventional farming practices [verify].

**Wind-Powered Desalination Systems and Integrated Solutions**

Small-scale wind turbines can provide a reliable source of renewable energy for desalination, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency. Pilot projects in the Mekong Delta have demonstrated the feasibility of combining agroforestry with wind-powered desalination systems to provide clean water for irrigation and drinking.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of these integrated solutions at scale:

1. **Develop policies that incentivize the use of renewable energy sources for desalination**, such as tax credits or feed-in tariffs.
2. **Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for farmers and communities** to adopt agroforestry and wind-powered desalination systems.
3. **Conduct further research on the economic impact, community engagement, and long-term sustainability of these integrated solutions**.

**Closing Outlook**

The Mekong Delta faces unprecedented water scarcity challenges due to climate change. Integrating agroforestry with wind-powered desalination systems can provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use. By supporting the adoption of these integrated solutions, policymakers can help build resilience in vulnerable communities.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Develop policies to incentivize the use of renewable energy sources for desalination.
2. Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for farmers and communities.
3. Conduct further research on the economic impact, community engagement, and long-term sustainability of these integrated solutions.
