# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Great Lakes Region: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To enhance water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in renewable energy, upgrading water infrastructure, and establishing early warning systems. By targeting 20% renewable energy consumption by 2030 and implementing water supply and sanitation projects, governments can reduce vulnerability to climate change and accelerate sustainable development.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts, with frequent droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events affecting millions of people. Water scarcity hinders agricultural productivity, while limited access to electricity stifles economic growth and limits opportunities for households and businesses (World Bank Open Data). According to UN-Water/WHO, 2.2 billion people globally lack safe water, with Sub-Saharan Africa having the lowest access rate at 32.4% (UN SDG Report 2023).

## Analysis

- **Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to safely managed drinking water, compared to the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data). This disparity is exacerbated in rural areas and among marginalized groups.
- **Electricity Access**: While progress has been made ([VERIFY] 53.3%), only half of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has reliable electricity access, leaving millions without basic power needs such as lighting or refrigeration for food storage (World Bank Open Data).
- **Renewable Energy Consumption**: The world consumes [VERIFY] 19.7% renewable energy, with a target of increasing this to 20% by 2030 (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Investment in Renewable Energy**:
   - **Target 20% Renewables by 2030**: Increase investment in solar and wind energy to achieve a minimum of 20% renewable energy consumption by 2030, leveraging existing World Bank projects.
   - **Support for Grid Modernization**: Provide grants or subsidies to upgrade electricity grids to improve reliability and efficiency. For example, the Solar Home System program has been successful in rural areas.

2. **Enhanced Water Infrastructure**:
   - **Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Implement water supply and sanitation projects targeting marginalized communities such as women, children, and disabled individuals. Focus on piped water connections and hand pumps.
   - **Rainwater Harvesting and Flood Mitigation**: Invest in rainwater harvesting systems and flood mitigation infrastructure like levees or berms to protect critical areas.

3. **Early Warning Systems**:
   - **Climate Risk Mapping**: Use satellite imagery and climate models to create detailed maps of vulnerable regions, highlighting hotspots for early warning systems.
   - **Community Engagement**: Train local communities in disaster preparedness and response, including evacuation routes and emergency shelters.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding Mechanisms**: Establish a dedicated fund or partnership among international donors, regional development banks, and national governments to finance these projects. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has successfully supported similar initiatives.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local technicians in renewable energy installation and maintenance, ensuring long-term sustainability of infrastructure investments.

## Conclusion

By prioritizing clean energy access, water security, and climate adaptation through strategic planning and targeted interventions, Sub-Saharan Africa can reduce vulnerability to climate change and accelerate sustainable development. Policymakers must act now to make these changes a reality, starting with the immediate investment in renewable energy and upgrading water infrastructure.
