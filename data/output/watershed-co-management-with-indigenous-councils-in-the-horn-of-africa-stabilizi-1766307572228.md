# Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils in the Horn of Africa: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts

## Executive Summary

Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity and droughts in the Horn of Africa, threatening food security and livelihoods of communities. This brief proposes watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a solution to stabilize food security during droughts.

## Introduction

The Horn of Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts and water scarcity. Current irrigation systems are often inefficient, leading to significant water loss [verify]. Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, while also reducing erosion and improving water retention.

## Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils

Indigenous councils in the Horn of Africa possess traditional knowledge on watershed management. By engaging these communities in decision-making processes, we can ensure that solutions are context-specific, culturally sensitive, and sustainable. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can be integrated into existing irrigation practices to reduce water loss [verify] and improve energy efficiency.

### Key Benefits

• Improved water retention and reduced erosion through agroforestry
• Increased energy efficiency through micro-hydro systems
• Reduced reliance on diesel generators and decreased energy costs
• Promoted sustainable agriculture and improved food security
• Enhanced community engagement and co-management of watersheds

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

1.  **Support Indigenous Councils:** Provide training, capacity-building, and resources to indigenous councils to enhance their role in watershed management.
2.  **Integrate Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems:** Encourage farmers to adopt agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a solution to water scarcity and energy costs.
3.  **Monitor and Evaluate:** Establish monitoring and evaluation frameworks to assess the effectiveness of integrated solutions.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils offers a promising approach to stabilizing food security during droughts in the Horn of Africa. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into existing irrigation practices, we can improve water efficiency and reduce energy costs. This brief highlights the need for policy support, community engagement, and further research to scale up these integrated solutions.

**Needed Evidence:**

*   Climate data on rainfall patterns in specific regions of the Horn of Africa (e.g., NOAA climate dataset)
*   Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from agroforestry-micro-hydro projects
*   Economic analysis highlighting cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Support Indigenous Councils:** Provide training, capacity-building, and resources to indigenous councils to enhance their role in watershed management.
2.  **Integrate Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems:** Encourage farmers to adopt agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a solution to water scarcity and energy costs.
3.  **Monitor and Evaluate:** Establish monitoring and evaluation frameworks to assess the effectiveness of integrated solutions.

By implementing these recommendations, we can improve food security, reduce poverty, and promote sustainable development in the Horn of Africa.
