**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To build climate-resilient societies in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing in enhanced water infrastructure, promoting renewable energy, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies. Specifically, governments and development partners should prioritize improving access to safe drinking water (currently at 32.4% of the population) by constructing and upgrading boreholes, wells, and other water extraction facilities in rural areas [1]. This intervention is crucial for addressing the region's critical challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. The region's population has inadequate access to safe drinking water (32.4% of the population) and electricity (53.3%), significantly impacting health, economic productivity, and quality of life [1]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by reducing freshwater resources and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves [2].

## Analysis

Recent data from the World Bank indicates that Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7%, far short of global targets [3]. The region also faces significant challenges in meeting SDG 6 goals for safely managed water supply, with only 74% coverage globally compared to 32.4% within the continent [4].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Infrastructure**: Invest $[VERIFY] million in constructing and upgrading boreholes, wells, and other water extraction facilities in rural areas. Implement community-managed systems with sustainable financing mechanisms such as user fees or grants [5]. Demonstrate successful models like the Integrated Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program to scale up implementation.
2. **Promoting Renewable Energy**: Increase government subsidies for solar home systems, particularly in off-grid rural communities. Encourage partnerships between private sector companies and NGOs to deploy renewable energy solutions such as solar-powered water pumps [6]. Promote community-based solar cooperatives to enhance local ownership and maintenance of solar installations.
3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early-warning systems for droughts, floods, and heatwaves using satellite imagery and ground-level sensors. Implement climate-resilient agricultural practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties and water-efficient irrigation techniques [7]. Establish watershed co-management initiatives with indigenous communities to ensure sustainable natural resource management.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost**: Estimated costs for implementing these interventions range from $[VERIFY] million for enhanced water infrastructure projects, $[VERIFY] million for renewable energy deployment, and $[VERIFY] million for climate adaptation measures. These figures are based on average project costs reported in previous Sub-Saharan Africa development initiatives.
- **Barriers**: Potential barriers include limited financial resources, technical expertise gaps, and resistance to change among local communities and government officials. Address these challenges through targeted training programs, community engagement workshops, and pilot projects that showcase the benefits of proposed solutions.

## Conclusion

Building climate-resilient societies in Sub-Saharan Africa hinges on addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation needs. By implementing evidence-based policies such as improved water infrastructure, renewable energy promotion, and climate-resilient agricultural practices, policymakers can significantly enhance living conditions and economic prospects for millions of people.
