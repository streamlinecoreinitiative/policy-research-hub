**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Lower Mekong Delta: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. To address these critical issues, we recommend implementing targeted interventions for improved water supply, renewable energy adoption, and climate adaptation strategies. Specifically, governments should invest in infrastructure projects like desalination plants and large-scale water storage facilities to improve access to safe drinking water (World Bank, 2024). This policy brief outlines the context, challenges, analysis, and recommendations for enhancing environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is the most vulnerable region globally when it comes to water security. Only [VERIFY] 32.4% of its population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). The region's limited infrastructure for clean energy sources like solar and wind exacerbates this issue. Furthermore, climate change impacts such as droughts and floods threaten the livelihoods of millions of people in the region. Immediate action is needed to meet Sustainable Development Goal 6 targets on water security within the next decade.

## Analysis

The statistics are stark: Sub-Saharan Africa's access to electricity stands at only [VERIFY] 53.3% (World Bank, 2023), highlighting a critical gap in energy infrastructure. Despite these challenges, renewable energy consumption accounts for just [VERIFY] 19.7% of total final energy consumption globally (World Bank, 2020). Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities: The region is projected to lose up to [NEEDS SOURCE] 35% of its current water resources by 2050 due to climate impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Security**: Invest in infrastructure projects like desalination plants and large-scale water storage facilities to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* Data: Access to safely managed drinking water is only [VERIFY] 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2024).
2. **Renewable Energy Expansion**: Increase investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enhance energy security.
	* Data: Renewable energy consumption accounts for [VERIFY] 19.7% globally (World Bank, 2020), with potential further growth through supportive policies and incentives.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**: Implement early warning systems and protective infrastructure like flood barriers to mitigate climate impacts on water resources and agriculture.

## Implementation Considerations

The total investment required for these initiatives could range from $1 billion to [NEEDS SOURCE] $5 billion annually, depending on scale and specificity of projects. High initial costs, need for institutional reforms to integrate renewable energy sources into national grids, and limited public-private partnerships are potential barriers to implementation.

## Conclusion

Addressing the water security, clean energy, and climate resilience challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa requires strategic investments and collaborative efforts. By prioritizing these interventions, governments can significantly enhance economic stability and improve health outcomes, contributing to a more resilient future for the region.
