**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Caribbean SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, limited access to electricity, and frequent climate shocks in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend immediate investments in infrastructure, technology adoption, and policy reforms. Specifically, we propose allocating [VERIFY] $5 billion annually for large-scale water supply projects, increasing renewable energy consumption by 30% within five years, and implementing early warning systems and climate adaptation initiatives in vulnerable regions.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change due to its reliance on rain-fed agriculture and inadequate energy systems. The lack of access to safe drinking water and electricity exacerbates health risks and economic disparities (World Bank, 2024). Climate events like droughts, floods, and heatwaves disproportionately affect communities already facing poverty and marginalization.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacks safe drinking water with [VERIFY] 32.4% having access (World Bank, 2024), a disparity due to inadequate infrastructure investments in water supply systems.
- **Clean Energy**: Only [VERIFY] 53.3% of the sub-region's population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), significantly lower than the global average of 91.6% (World Bank, 2023). The energy mix relies heavily on fossil fuels, contributing to air pollution and climate change.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Despite significant warming trends, Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is just [VERIFY] 19.7% (World Bank, 2020), underutilizing clean sources that threaten the region's ability to adapt to climate impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Infrastructure**: Fund and implement large-scale water supply projects such as boreholes, pipelines, and rainwater harvesting systems.
   - Data: 2024 World Bank report indicates a need for additional investment in water infrastructure to improve access to safe drinking water.

2. **Promote Renewable Energy**: Increase the share of renewable energy in Sub-Saharan Africa's total final energy consumption by [VERIFY] 30% within five years, starting with solar and wind projects.
   - Data: Current renewable energy consumption is only [VERIFY] 19.7%, suggesting a significant potential for growth as highlighted by World Bank data.

3. **Support Climate Resilience Programs**: Implement early warning systems and climate adaptation initiatives in vulnerable regions to mitigate the effects of extreme weather events.
   - Data: Sub-Saharan Africa experiences frequent droughts, floods, and heatwaves which require targeted resilience programs supported by [VERIFY] $2 billion annually.

## Implementation Considerations

- Funding constraints necessitate innovative financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships (PPP) and green bonds. PPP models can leverage private sector expertise while attracting public funds.
- Community engagement is crucial to ensure that projects are sustainable and meet local needs, which requires significant investment in community capacity building.
- Potential barriers include political instability, corruption, and lack of skilled labor. Strengthening governance structures and implementing anti-corruption measures will be essential.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to combat the region's vulnerabilities effectively. Implementing these recommendations can significantly improve living standards while contributing to global sustainability goals.
