**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Great Lakes Region: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region is home to millions of peri-urban households that rely on traditional cooking methods contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution. This brief explores the potential for transitioning these households to cleaner cooking practices, focusing on the intersection of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

**Introduction**

The Great Lakes region is characterized by a high population density, limited access to modern cooking facilities, and an increasing reliance on biomass fuels (e.g., charcoal, firewood). This traditional cooking sector contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, with erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation from highland wetlands threatening food security and economic stability.

**Water Scarcity in the Great Lakes Region**

*   **Climate Change Impacts:** Erratic rainfall patterns, increased evaporation from highland wetlands, and rising temperatures contribute to severe water scarcity.
*   **Importance of Resilient Irrigation Methods:** Smallholder farmers rely on irrigation for food security and economic stability. However, traditional methods are energy-intensive, costly, and often inefficient.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Solution**

1.  **Benefits of Agroforestry:**
    *   Soil health improvement
    *   Biodiversity enhancement
    *   Carbon sequestration
2.  **Micro-Hydro Technology:** Small-scale hydroelectric systems reduce reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency.
3.  **Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro:** Pilot projects demonstrate the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro, enhancing water retention, reducing erosion, and increasing renewable energy production.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

1.  **Support Adoption at Scale:**
    *   Policy incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
    *   Capacity building programs for extension services and local governments.
2.  **Economic Analysis:** Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects, including potential revenue streams from renewable energy sales.
3.  **Community Engagement:** Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated solutions.

**Closing Outlook**

The transition to cleaner cooking practices in peri-urban households of the Great Lakes region is crucial for safeguarding freshwater ecosystems. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can enhance water security, increase renewable energy use, and contribute to broader sustainable development goals.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop Policy Incentives:** Governments should provide incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Capacity Building Programs:** Extension services and local governments require capacity building programs to support the adoption of these solutions.
3.  **Community Engagement:** Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated solutions should be conducted.

**Needed Evidence:**

*   Climate data for specific regions of the Great Lakes region (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
*   Economic analysis of cost estimates and financial viability for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
*   Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated solutions.
