**Securing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Comprehensive Approach**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in securing water security, achieving clean energy access, and building climate resilience. With nearly 50% of the population lacking reliable electricity and over 2 billion people without safe drinking water (World Bank Open Data), these issues threaten both economic development and public health. This brief recommends implementing cost-effective, scalable solutions for clean energy access, improving water security through innovative technologies, and enhancing climate resilience.

### Key Findings

* Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in access to safe drinking water ([VERIFY] 53.3% vs. [NEEDS SOURCE] global average) (World Bank Open Data).
* The region has seen a [NEEDS SOURCE] global coverage for safely managed drinking water access, indicating progress but still far from universal (UN SDG Report 2023).
* Sub-Saharan Africa lags significantly behind the world average in electricity access ([VERIFY] 53.3 vs. [NEEDS SOURCE]%), with limited government funding and infrastructure challenges (World Bank Open Data).

### Recommendations

1. **Expand Renewable Energy Access**:
	* Invest in solar, wind, and hydro projects to increase clean energy generation by at least [NEEDS SOURCE]% within the next five years.
	* Achieve a 20% renewable energy share by 2030 (UNFCCC).
	* Focus on off-grid solutions for rural areas and integrate into national power grids.
2. **Enhance Water Security**:
	* Implement water harvesting, desalination plants in coastal regions, and expand borehole drilling programs to improve access.
	* Increase safe drinking water access by [NEEDS SOURCE]% by 2035 (UN SDG Report 2023).
	* Collaborate with local communities for sustainable management of water resources.
3. **Climate Adaptation and Resilience**:
	* Develop early warning systems for droughts, floods, and heatwaves using satellite imagery and IoT devices.
	* Deploy at least one early warning system in every major climate risk zone by 2025 (UN Climate Change Adaptation Strategy).
	* Prioritize vulnerable regions such as arid and semi-arid lands.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with a severe lack of basic infrastructure, particularly in electricity ([VERIFY] 53.3%) and safe drinking water ([NEEDS SOURCE]). These deficiencies hinder economic growth and public health. Climate change intensifies these challenges by increasing drought frequency and intensity, leading to reduced agricultural productivity and increased water scarcity.

## Analysis

The region has seen significant progress in safely managed drinking water access, but still falls short of universal coverage. Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world average in electricity access, with limited government funding and infrastructure challenges. Renewable energy consumption is low ([VERIFY] 19.7%), falling short of global targets and crucial for sustainable development.

## Implementation Considerations

* **Costs**:
	+ Expand renewable energy projects to [NEEDS SOURCE] billion annually.
	+ Water security initiatives require investments in infrastructure, technology, and community engagement totaling approximately [NEEDS SOURCE] million per year.
* **Barriers**: Limited budget constraints, technical expertise gaps, and resistance from traditional power sources.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. By implementing targeted policies and leveraging available resources, these goals can be achieved within a decade. Stakeholders need to collaborate effectively at all levels to overcome political and institutional barriers and ensure sustainable development for the region's future.
