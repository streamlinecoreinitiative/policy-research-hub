**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Pacific SIDS: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges in sub-Saharan Africa. With [VERIFY] 32.4% of its population lacking safe drinking water access (World Bank, 2024), the region requires strategic investments in renewable energy infrastructure, water security measures, and energy-efficient technologies to foster sustainable development.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water scarcity, limited electricity access, and climate variability. The region's freshwater resources are under pressure, with only [VERIFY] 9.2% of global freshwater withdrawal (World Bank, 2021). Climate change exacerbates these challenges, leading to increased frequency and intensity of droughts and floods. Specifically:

* Water scarcity affects over [NEEDS SOURCE] people globally.
* Electricity access remains low at [VERIFY] 53.3% in sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2023).
* Renewable energy consumption accounts for only [VERIFY] 19.7% of total final energy consumption worldwide (World Bank, 2020).

## Analysis

The analysis highlights the importance of clean energy access and water security measures:

* Solar energy can play a pivotal role in addressing both electricity access and climate resilience.
* Community-based watershed management programs that integrate climate-resilient infrastructure, such as rainwater harvesting systems and small-scale irrigation projects powered by renewable energy sources, are essential for water security.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Investment in Renewable Energy Infrastructure**: Governments should prioritize the development of solar power plants and micro-grids to enhance electricity access in rural areas.
2. **Water Security Measures**: Implement community-based watershed management programs that integrate climate-resilient infrastructure, such as rainwater harvesting systems and small-scale irrigation projects powered by renewable energy sources.
3. **Energy-Efficient Technologies**: Promote the adoption of energy-efficient appliances and solar-powered refrigeration units for food storage in agricultural regions to reduce carbon emissions.

## Implementation Considerations

* The initial costs for solar power installations can be substantial, but long-term savings on electricity bills outweigh these expenses.
* Community participation is crucial for successful implementation; involving local leaders and residents ensures sustainability and ownership of projects.
* Technical assistance from international organizations may be necessary to ensure proper design and operation of renewable energy systems.

## Conclusion

By focusing on clean energy access and water security, sub-Saharan Africa can build a more resilient future. This will not only improve living conditions but also contribute to broader climate goals. Policymakers should prioritize these interventions as they align with both sustainable development objectives and immediate humanitarian needs.
