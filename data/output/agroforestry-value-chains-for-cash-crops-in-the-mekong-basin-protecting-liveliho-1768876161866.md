# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Mekong basin: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Mekong Basin: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

To enhance water security, clean energy use, and climate resilience in lower-income countries, we recommend investing in agroforestry value chains for cash crops. This approach can improve farmers' livelihoods while reducing environmental degradation. Specifically, governments should:

1. **Develop Agroforestry Value Chains**: Support the development of agroforestry practices that integrate trees into farming systems to promote biodiversity and reduce soil erosion.
2. **Promote Climate-Smart Agriculture**: Invest in climate-resilient crop varieties and water management techniques to enhance agricultural productivity under changing climatic conditions.
3. **Enhance Water Security**: Implement water harvesting systems, desalination plants, and rainwater collection technologies tailored for arid regions.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant barriers in accessing safe drinking water (73.7% globally) [1] and reliable electricity (91.6% globally) [2]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing variability of freshwater resources and leading to more frequent extreme weather events. The Mekong Basin, which spans across six countries, is particularly vulnerable to climate-related disasters.

## Analysis

World Bank data shows that only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity [2]. In contrast, renewable energy consumption stands at just over a quarter (19.7%) globally [3]. These stark disparities underscore the urgent need for policy interventions to improve both water security and energy access.

Access to safe drinking water is crucial but remains unmet in many regions: Sub-Saharan Africa has only 32.4% of its population accessing safely managed water sources, compared to an estimated 73.7% globally [1]. This gap highlights the critical need for targeted interventions such as constructing new wells and improving existing infrastructure.

Climate change impacts are particularly acute in Sub-Saharan Africa:

* Increased frequency of droughts reduces agricultural productivity.
* More frequent flooding damages infrastructure and disrupts livelihoods.
* Extreme weather events like cyclones lead to loss of life and property [4].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Develop Agroforestry Value Chains**: Invest in agroforestry practices that integrate trees into farming systems to promote biodiversity and reduce soil erosion.
	* Data: Sub-Saharan Africa's access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) versus global average (73.7%)
2. **Promote Climate-Smart Agriculture**: Support the development of climate-resilient crop varieties and water management techniques to enhance agricultural productivity under changing climatic conditions.
	* Data: 91.6% of the world population has access to electricity compared to only 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa
3. **Enhance Water Security**: Implement water harvesting systems, desalination plants, and rainwater collection technologies tailored for arid regions.
	* Data: Global renewable energy consumption at 19.7%, with a notable gap for Sub-Saharan Africa

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires addressing several challenges:

* **Financing**: Mobilize public-private partnerships to fund large-scale infrastructure projects.
* **Capacity Building**: Train local communities and governments in sustainable resource management practices.
* **Policy Coordination**: Ensure intersectoral collaboration between water, energy, climate change departments.

## Conclusion

Addressing the triple challenge of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience is essential for building more resilient societies. By adopting evidence-based policies and engaging stakeholders at all levels, lower-income countries can make significant progress in safeguarding their futures from environmental stresses.
