**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Sahel: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief recommends the implementation of early-warning systems and last-mile alerts to mitigate disaster losses in vulnerable communities across the Sahel region. With only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank 2024) [1] and only 53.3% with electricity access, addressing these issues is critical for sustainable development and improving public health outcomes. The brief outlines actionable steps to enhance water security through improved access to safe drinking water sources, promote clean energy adoption via renewable sources, and build climate resilience across the region.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a triple challenge of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. With stark disparities in basic services like water and electricity, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank 2024) [1], while Sub-Saharan Africa's electricity access stands at just 53.3%, far below global averages (World Bank 2023) [2]. These issues exacerbate climate vulnerability, as low renewable energy consumption underscores the region's urgent need for sustainable energy solutions.

## Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe water security crisis with only 32.4% of its population having access to safely managed drinking water sources (World Bank 2024) [1], starkly contrasted against the global average of 73.7%, indicating immense disparities (World Bank 2024) [3]. Furthermore, Sub-Saharan Africa's electricity access rate remains at a mere 53.3%, far below the world’s 91.6% (World Bank 2023) [2], highlighting significant energy poverty. These challenges are exacerbated by low renewable energy consumption, currently standing at just 19.7%, which is significantly lower than global targets and underscores the region's urgent need for sustainable energy solutions.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Security**: Invest in infrastructure projects to improve access to safe drinking water sources by building boreholes or other accessible water points. Targeted subsidies can be provided to households to offset costs.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Adoption**: Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power through grants, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships. This will not only reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also create jobs in clean technology sectors.
3. **Climate Resilience Measures**: Implement nature-based solutions like reforestation, afforestation, and restoring degraded ecosystems to enhance water security and build resilience against climate impacts such as droughts and floods.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure these recommendations are effectively implemented, consider the following practical steps:

- **Funding Mechanisms**: Establish dedicated funds for clean energy projects and water infrastructure improvements. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can leverage additional resources.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local communities in maintenance of water points and renewable energy systems to ensure long-term sustainability. This includes technical training and financial management skills.
- **Community Engagement**: Engage with community leaders and stakeholders for buy-in and participation in project planning and implementation, ensuring that interventions are culturally relevant and sustainable.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges in accessing safe drinking water and electricity highlight the urgent need for targeted policy interventions. By focusing on enhancing water security through improved access to safe drinking water sources, promoting clean energy adoption via renewable sources, and building climate resilience with nature-based solutions, governments can significantly improve public health outcomes and economic stability.
