# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Horn of Africa: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa region is vulnerable to landslides due to its unique geography and climate. This brief explores nature-based solutions that can mitigate landslide risk, while also addressing critical sectors such as water security and clean energy.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity and Landslide Risk in the Horn of Africa

The Horn of Africa is characterized by arid and semi-arid conditions, with erratic rainfall patterns exacerbating water scarcity. This has severe implications for agriculture, food security, and economic stability. The region's unique geography also makes it prone to landslides.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

* Existing irrigation systems in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt include boreholes and canals.
* Water loss percentages from these systems are significant: [verify]%
	+ Evaporation
	+ Seepage
	+ Leakage
* These losses contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience and Landslide Prevention

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, communities can:

* Reduce erosion and landslides
* Improve water retention and availability
* Enhance ecosystem services and resilience

### Case Studies: Agroforestry in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

Several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving water retention and reducing erosion. For example:

* A study in Nigeria showed that agroforestry improved soil moisture by [verify]%
* A project in Chad reduced sedimentation in rivers by [verify]%

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficient Water Use and Renewable Energy

Micro-hydro technology can provide clean energy for irrigation systems, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Benefits include:

* Reduced greenhouse gas emissions
* Improved water use efficiency
* Increased energy independence

### Pilot Projects: Integrating Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

Several pilot projects have demonstrated the potential of integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems. These initiatives have shown that communities can improve their resilience to climate-related disasters.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Horn of Africa, we recommend:

* Developing policies that incentivize agroforestry and micro-hydro investments
* Conducting further research on the economic impact and community acceptance of these solutions
* Scaling up pilot projects to reach more communities in the region

## Actions/Recommendations:

1. **Develop policy frameworks** that support the adoption of nature-based solutions for landslide risk.
2. **Conduct further research** on the economic impact, community acceptance, and scalability of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Scale up pilot projects** to reach more communities in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt.

## Closing Outlook

The Horn of Africa region is vulnerable to landslides due to its unique geography and climate. By integrating nature-based solutions such as agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, communities can improve their resilience to climate-related disasters while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
