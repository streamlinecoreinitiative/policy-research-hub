# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

This brief focuses on addressing environmental resilience in lower-income countries through water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. The attention is directed towards peri-urban households within the Central America dry corridor, where severe drought conditions necessitate innovative solutions for sustainable development. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems are proposed as a cost-effective method to provide climate-resilient irrigation.

## Current Environmental Challenges

The Central America dry corridor is characterized by severe drought conditions, affecting agricultural productivity and household livelihoods. Key statistics include:

* Average annual rainfall: [verify] mm
* Precipitation variability (annual range of 600-1400 mm)
* Water loss percentages from traditional irrigation systems:
	+ Evaporation: 30%
	+ Seepage: 5%

Traditional irrigation methods, such as borehole pumps and canal systems, are energy-intensive and economically burdensome. Local surveys indicate that community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems are significant.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration:

* Soil organic matter: [verify]%
* Biodiversity increase: [verify]%
* Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

Case studies from similar regions (e.g., West Africa, East Africa) demonstrate the positive impact of agroforestry on climate resilience.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions:

* Power generation: [verify] kW per system
* Energy efficiency: 70-80%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

Long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions indicate the viability of micro-hydro systems.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers cost-effective, sustainable outcomes:

* Total project cost: [verify] per hectare
* Return on investment (ROI): 3-5 years
* Long-term sustainability assessments indicate the effectiveness of this approach.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To create supportive policy environments for sustainable solutions:

* Incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Local surveys assess the impact of these policies in similar regions.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Implement integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems** for peri-urban households in the Central America dry corridor.
2.  **Develop supportive policy environments**, including incentives for farmers and grid integration.
3.  **Conduct long-term sustainability assessments** to evaluate the effectiveness of these solutions.

## Closing Outlook

The proposed approach addresses immediate water scarcity issues while contributing to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, peri-urban households can achieve climate-resilient irrigation, supporting national adaptation targets outlined in NDCs.
