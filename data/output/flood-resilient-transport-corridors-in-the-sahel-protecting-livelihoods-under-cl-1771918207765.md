# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Sahel: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Sahel: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the triple burden of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability threatens sustainable development. To address these interlinked challenges, we recommend prioritizing flood-resilient transport corridors in the Sahel region. This involves investing in infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events while providing safe drinking water, renewable energy, and climate adaptation measures. By doing so, governments and development partners can build resilient communities that can withstand future shocks.

Key Findings:

* Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to safely managed drinking water, with a global average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data].
* Access to electricity is higher at 53.3%, compared to the world-wide average of 91.6% [Source: World Bank].
* Renewable energy consumption stands at only 19.7%, significantly below the world’s total final energy consumption [Source: World Bank].

Recommendations:

1. **Prioritize flood-resilient transport corridors in the Sahel region**: Invest in infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events while providing safe drinking water, renewable energy, and climate adaptation measures.
2. **Increase funding for water infrastructure projects**: Allocate at least 10% of national budgets towards environmental resilience initiatives, with a focus on water security and clean energy.

## Context & Challenge

The challenge of environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is exacerbated by:

* Limited access to safe drinking water (32.4% vs world average of 73.7%, [Source: World Bank Open Data]).
* Low electricity access (53.3% vs world average of 91.6%, [Source: World Bank]).
* High vulnerability to climate-induced shocks and stresses.

These factors collectively hinder development progress, exacerbating poverty and inequality.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in providing safe drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Investment in infrastructure such as wells, boreholes, and pipelines can improve access to clean water. However, the cost of these investments is often prohibitively high for many communities.

### Clean Energy

Renewables like solar, wind, and hydro offer low-carbon alternatives that can meet growing energy demands sustainably. Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is only 19.7%, far below the global average [Source: World Bank].

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts such as droughts and floods threaten water security and food systems. Integrated approaches are needed to enhance resilience, including integrated watershed management.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase funding for flood-resilient transport corridors**: Allocate at least $[VERIFY] million per year for 5 years towards infrastructure projects that can withstand extreme weather events.
2. **Implement cost-sharing schemes with communities**: Ensure sustainability by implementing cost-sharing schemes with communities to ensure long-term maintenance and operation of water infrastructure.
3. **Provide subsidies or grants for renewable energy technologies**: Offer incentives for the adoption of renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines.

## Implementation Considerations

### Funding

Allocate at least 10% of national budgets towards environmental resilience initiatives, with a focus on water security and clean energy. Seek international development partners for additional funding to support infrastructure projects.

### Implementation Steps

Establish task forces to oversee implementation of policy recommendations. Monitor progress through regular assessments and adjust strategies as needed.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation is crucial for building resilient communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. By investing in flood-resilient transport corridors and prioritizing water infrastructure projects, governments and development partners can lay the groundwork for sustainable growth and poverty reduction in the future.
