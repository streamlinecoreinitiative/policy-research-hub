# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Great Lakes region: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, particularly droughts, which pose significant risks to smallholder farmers' livelihoods and food security. Integrating micro-insurance with climate-resilient irrigation systems can provide a cost-effective solution for supporting adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By combining agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with micro-insurance, smallholder farmers can reduce their vulnerability to drought-related risks.

**Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Great Lakes Region**

The Great Lakes region is characterized by erratic rainfall patterns, which exacerbate water scarcity. Climate change projections indicate a decrease in annual rainfall, but specific percentages are not provided [verify]. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, further straining smallholder farmers' resources.

* **Rationale:** Climate change impacts agriculture, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns.
	+ *Bullet Points:*
		- Erratic rainfall creates challenges for traditional irrigation methods.
		- Traditional systems are energy-intensive and costly.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Great Lakes region include boreholes and canals. Water loss percentages from these systems range between 30% evaporation and 5% seepage [verify]. More research is needed to confirm these specific water loss percentages.

* **Rationale:** Describes existing irrigation systems.
	+ *Bullet Points:*
		- Traditional irrigation systems include boreholes and canals.
		- Water loss from these systems is a concern.

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it more resilient to climate change impacts. Research has shown that agroforestry practices can improve crop yields and reduce erosion (e.g., [1]).

* **Rationale:** Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
	+ *Outline:*
		- Discuss benefits of agroforestry (soil health, biodiversity, carbon sequestration).
		- Provide case studies from similar regions like the Great Lakes region.
		- Highlight successful implementations in other parts of Africa.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators. Studies have demonstrated that micro-hydro systems can increase energy efficiency and reduce costs (e.g., [2]).

* **Rationale:** Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation.
	+ *Outline:*
		- Describe micro-hydro technology (e.g., small-scale hydroelectric plants).
		- Highlight benefits of micro-hydro systems (reduced reliance on diesel generators, increased energy efficiency).
		- Discuss successful implementations in similar regions.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. Research is needed to validate the long-term impacts and sustainability of these integrated systems.

* **Rationale:** Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions.
	+ *Outline:*
		- Showcase integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects, highlighting their cost-effectiveness.
		- Detail cost estimates and financial viability analyses to support the feasibility of these solutions.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions. Future research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability.

* **Rationale:** Policy measures can create a supportive environment, while future research is needed.
	+ *Outline:*
		- Suggest policy recommendations (incentives for farmers, grid integration with micro-hydro systems).
		- Identify areas of future research (economic impact assessments, community acceptance studies).

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Develop and Implement Climate-Resilient Irrigation Systems:** Integrate agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems to provide sustainable irrigation solutions.
2. **Establish Micro-Insurance Programs:** Develop micro-insurance programs that cover drought-related risks for smallholder farmers.
3. **Support Policy Frameworks:** Encourage policy frameworks that support the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation systems and micro-insurance programs.

**Closing Outlook**

The Great Lakes region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, particularly droughts. Integrating micro-insurance with agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can provide a cost-effective solution for supporting adaptation targets in NDCs. By combining these approaches, smallholder farmers can reduce their vulnerability to drought-related risks.
