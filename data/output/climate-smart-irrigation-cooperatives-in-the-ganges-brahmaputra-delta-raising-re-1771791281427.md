**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability, affecting over 1 billion people. To address these challenges, we recommend prioritizing investments in water infrastructure and renewable energy projects to increase coverage and reduce poverty.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with limited access to safe drinking water, posing significant health risks for its population. According to the World Bank Open Data (2024), only 32.4% of the region's population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. Climate change exacerbates existing challenges by increasing drought frequency and intensity, threatening food security and public health.

## Analysis

Despite significant progress globally in improving access to safe drinking water, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind. The region's renewable energy consumption is only 9.2%, far below global levels (19.7%) [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020]. Lack of investment in renewables limits options for sustainable energy solutions and exacerbates poverty.

## Policy Recommendations

### a) Water Security

* Invest in water infrastructure such as wells, pipelines, and rainwater harvesting systems to ensure access to safe drinking water.
* Allocate at least 10% of the total budget towards water sector improvements [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024].
* Collaborate with international organizations like UNICEF and NGOs for project implementation.

### b) Renewable Energy Access

* Develop micro-grids, solar-powered mini-hydropower plants, and wind turbines in rural areas to provide electricity access.
* Allocate 5% of the national budget towards renewable energy projects [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020].
* Engage with local governments and private sector entities for project development.

### c) Climate Adaptation

* Implement early warning systems, drought-resistant crop varieties, and climate-resilient infrastructure in vulnerable regions.
* Allocate 2% of the national budget towards climate adaptation initiatives [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020].
* Collaborate with international agencies like UNDP and World Bank for project coordination.

## Implementation Considerations

Addressing these challenges requires efficient budget allocation strategies to ensure funds reach the most vulnerable populations. Potential costs include $[VERIFY] billion in investments required for water infrastructure and renewable energy projects (estimated based on current cost data). To overcome potential barriers, governments should form dedicated task forces, promote public-private partnerships, and secure additional financial resources.

## Conclusion

Strengthening water security, renewable energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for improving the health, economic stability, and overall well-being of its population. By taking swift and targeted actions, we can address these pressing issues and create a more resilient future for all.

**Call to Action**: Government officials should prioritize and allocate resources towards water security, renewable energy access, and climate adaptation initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa. NGOs and development practitioners must collaborate with local communities to ensure projects are effective and sustainable.
