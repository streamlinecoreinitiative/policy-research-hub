# Climate Resilient Water Security and Clean Energy: Strengthening Lower-Income Countries’ Adaptation

**Climate Resilient Water Security and Clean Energy: Strengthening Lower-Income Countries’ Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% access to safely managed drinking water) [1] and electricity (53.3%) [2], with only 9.2% of freshwater withdrawal meeting sustainability standards [1]. Climate change exacerbates these issues by increasing droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. To address these challenges, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, implementing solar-powered wells for safe drinking water, and investing in renewable energy projects tailored to the unique needs of Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan African countries are among the least equipped in terms of access to safe drinking water (32.4%) [1] and electricity (53.3%) [2]. The region's reliance on fossil fuels for energy exacerbates climate change impacts, including frequent droughts and unpredictable rainfall patterns that affect agricultural productivity and water resources. These challenges not only hinder economic growth but also threaten the health and livelihoods of millions.

## Analysis

1. **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe water scarcity (32.4% access to safely managed drinking water) [1], leading to poor hygiene practices, increased disease prevalence, and reduced agricultural productivity [2].
   - According to World Bank data, 2.2 billion people lack safe water globally, with the majority residing in lower-income countries [3].

2. **Clean Energy Access**: The region lags behind in electricity access (53.3%) [2] with only 9.2% of freshwater withdrawal meeting sustainability standards, highlighting the urgent need for renewable energy solutions [1].
   - Renewable energy consumption accounts for 19.7% of global energy consumption, but this share is expected to increase as countries transition towards cleaner energy sources [4].

3. **Climate Resilience**: Climate change increases vulnerability to droughts and floods, exacerbating water scarcity and affecting agricultural productivity (e.g., maize yield loss due to climate change in Kenya) [5]. Additionally, extreme weather events lead to power outages, increasing energy poverty.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Establish cooperative irrigation systems that use climate-smart technologies and practices (e.g., drip irrigation) to optimize water usage and ensure sustainable agricultural productivity.
   - Initial investments for these cooperatives range from $10,000-$50,000 per cooperative [6].

2. **Solar-Powered Wells for Safe Drinking Water**: Implement solar-powered wells in rural areas, ensuring access to clean drinking water without the need for grid electricity, thereby reducing health risks and improving hygiene practices.
   - The cost of a single solar-powered well is approximately $20,000-$30,000 [7].

3. **Renewable Energy Projects**: Invest in renewable energy projects such as small-scale hydropower plants and off-grid solar systems, particularly in remote areas where access to conventional energy sources is limited.
   - Small-scale hydropower plants cost approximately $20,000 to $30,000 per MW [8].

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Initial investments for climate-smart irrigation cooperatives and solar-powered wells range from $10,000-$50,000 per cooperative. Renewable energy projects have varying costs depending on project size and technology.
- **Barriers**: Potential barriers include limited financial resources, technical expertise, and lack of political will. Addressing these requires multi-stakeholder partnerships and targeted capacity-building programs.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and energy access through climate-resilient interventions is essential for improving the well-being of lower-income countries' populations. By adopting climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, solar-powered wells, and renewable energy projects, decision-makers can mitigate climate change impacts and promote sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa.

**Call to Action**: Encourage governments, NGOs, and donors to prioritize these interventions as part of their national strategies for achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and promoting inclusive economic growth.
