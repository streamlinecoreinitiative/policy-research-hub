**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, where climate change is exacerbating water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges. We recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy solutions, such as solar-powered water pumps and biogas stoves, to improve household energy security and reduce dependency on non-renewable sources (World Bank, 2023). Additionally, we suggest implementing comprehensive sanitation projects and investing in modernizing existing infrastructure to ensure access to safe drinking water by 2030 (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. With [VERIFY] % of the world's population lacking safe drinking water and only [53.3%] having access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2024), there is a pressing need for sustainable solutions that can bridge these gaps while also addressing the increasing impacts of climate change.

### Analysis

* **Water Security:** Sub-Saharan Africa faces critical challenges in ensuring safe drinking water for all citizens. While [73.7%] of the world's population has access (World Bank, 2024), only [32.4%] of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population benefits from this (Sub-Saharan Africa, World Bank, 2024). This disparity underscores the urgent need for improved water infrastructure and sanitation facilities.
* **Clean Energy Access:** Despite a global trend towards renewable energy consumption at [19.7%], Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only [53.3%] of its population having access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). This disparity is not only an issue of basic utility but also hinders economic development and climate mitigation efforts.
* **Climate Adaptation:** The region faces increasing threats from climate change, including droughts and floods that disrupt water security. Climate projections indicate a need for robust adaptation strategies to protect communities and ecosystems.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water:** Implement comprehensive sanitation projects and invest in modernizing existing infrastructure to ensure access by 2030 (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). Allocate additional funding for rural areas where access is most limited.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Solutions:** Encourage the deployment of solar-powered water pumps, biogas stoves, and other renewable energy technologies to reduce dependency on non-renewable sources and improve household energy security (World Bank, 2023).
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Programs:** Develop early warning systems for climate events such as droughts and floods, alongside investment in resilient infrastructure like water storage facilities and irrigation systems.

### Implementation Considerations

* **Costs:** Initial investments are substantial but yield long-term benefits through improved health outcomes and economic growth (World Bank, 2024).
* **Barriers:** Political will is crucial; governments must prioritize these projects within their national budgets. Additionally, addressing institutional barriers such as regulatory frameworks and public-private partnerships can accelerate implementation.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa needs targeted interventions to enhance its environmental resilience. By focusing on water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, the region can pave the way for sustainable development while safeguarding vulnerable communities against future shocks. Leadership from government officials, NGO leaders, and international partners is essential to realizing these goals.
