**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Pacific SIDS: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity, heatwaves, and landslide risks in lower-income countries, particularly in the Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This brief highlights the importance of nature-based solutions to address these pressing issues. We focus on agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems as a climate-resilient approach for irrigation.

**Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity in Lower-Income Countries**

Climate change alters precipitation patterns, leading to increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods. In the Pacific SIDS, rising temperatures intensify heatwaves, which can have devastating impacts on human health, agriculture, and infrastructure. Landslides triggered by heavy rainfall or thawing permafrost pose significant risks to communities and ecosystems.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation systems in lower-income countries often rely on energy-intensive borehole pumps and canal networks, resulting in significant water losses through evaporation and seepage. These methods are costly and unsustainable, exacerbating water scarcity issues.

    *   Evaporation: 30%
    *   Seepage: 5%

**Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices can enhance soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making them more resilient to climate change impacts. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, communities can create sustainable water supply solutions.

*   **Benefits of Agroforestry:**
    *   Soil organic matter increases by 2-8%.
    *   Biodiversity increase by 15-30 native species.
    *   Carbon sequestration by 3-7 tons/ha/year.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. These systems can be integrated with agroforestry practices to create climate-resilient water supply solutions.

*   **Specific Data:**
    *   Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system.
    *   Energy efficiency is at 70-80%.
    *   Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up. These projects have the potential to improve health outcomes during heatwaves by providing sustainable water supply.

*   **Cost Estimates and Financial Viability Analysis:**
    *   Total project cost per hectare is $10,000-$25,000.
    *   Return on investment (ROI) is 3-5 years.
    *   Long-term sustainability assessments.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions. Future research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

*   **Policy Recommendations:**
    *   Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans).
    *   Grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
    *   Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities).

**Needed Evidence**

To further validate the effectiveness of nature-based solutions, additional evidence is required.

*   **Climate Data:**
    *   NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Pacific SIDS (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
*   **Economic Analysis:**
    *   Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
*   **Socioeconomic Studies:**
    *   Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

Nature-based solutions, such as agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, offer a promising approach to addressing water scarcity, heatwaves, and landslide risks in lower-income countries. By integrating these practices with policy measures and future research directions, we can create more resilient communities and ecosystems.
