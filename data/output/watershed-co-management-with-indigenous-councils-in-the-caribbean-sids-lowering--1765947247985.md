# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Caribbean SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

In the face of climate change, small island developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean are particularly vulnerable to environmental degradation and economic instability. This brief highlights the potential of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a low-cost, high-impact strategy for reducing emissions in critical sectors such as water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. By integrating biochar-based agroforestry systems into rural landscapes, communities can enhance soil fertility, reduce runoff, and generate renewable energy from waste. This approach not only supports climate resilience but also promotes economic stability by ensuring year-round food security.

## Climate Resilience Through Enhanced Soil Fertility

Climate change poses significant challenges to agricultural productivity in the Caribbean SIDS, where variable rainfall patterns and increased temperatures threaten crop yields. Biochar technology offers a promising solution for enhancing soil fertility and improving water retention capacity. By incorporating biochar into agroforestry systems, farmers can:

• Improve soil moisture retention by up to 30% (FAO, 2020)
• Enhance soil structure and nutrient content, leading to increased crop yields under variable climate conditions
• Reduce runoff and erosion by up to 25% (World Bank, 2019)

## Renewable Energy Generation from Agroforestry Waste

The Caribbean SIDS have significant potential for renewable energy generation from biomass. Pyrolysis processes can convert agroforestry waste into bio-oil, biogas, or biochar, providing a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. This approach offers several benefits:

• Reduced greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70% compared to traditional fossil fuel-based systems (OECD, 2020)
• Improved energy security and reduced reliance on imported fuels
• Job creation and economic benefits for rural communities through the establishment of small-scale renewable energy facilities

## Economic Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

The adoption of biochar-based agroforestry systems can provide significant economic benefits for farmers in the Caribbean SIDS. A comparative analysis between traditional farming practices and biochar-based systems reveals:

• Cost savings per hectare from reduced chemical fertilizers due to improved soil fertility (estimated at $100-$200)
• Increased crop yields leading to higher income for farmers
• Potential for carbon credits through the sale of verified emission reductions

## Policy Recommendations for Scaling Up Implementation

To facilitate the widespread adoption of biochar-based systems, governments in the Caribbean SIDS can consider:

• Subsidies and incentives for farmers to adopt biochar-based agroforestry practices
• Technical support and training programs for farmers and indigenous councils on watershed co-management and biochar application
• Market incentives and policies to promote the use of renewable energy from biomass

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Establish a regional framework** for watershed co-management with indigenous councils, incorporating biochar-based agroforestry systems.
2. **Develop and implement policies** to support the adoption of biochar-based practices, including subsidies and technical assistance programs.
3. **Invest in research and development**, focusing on long-term impact studies (5+ years) to assess sustainability and resilience improvements.
4. **Engage with local communities**, ensuring that indigenous councils are involved in decision-making processes related to watershed co-management.

## Closing Outlook

The adoption of biochar-based agroforestry systems offers a promising solution for reducing emissions from critical sectors in the Caribbean SIDS. By integrating these practices into rural landscapes, communities can enhance climate resilience, promote economic stability, and ensure year-round food security. With the support of governments, international organizations, and local stakeholders, we can unlock the full potential of watershed co-management with indigenous councils to build a more sustainable future for the region.

**Data Gaps:**

* Detailed cost-benefit analysis comparing biochar agroforestry with current farming practices
* Long-term impact studies (5+ years) to assess sustainability and resilience improvements
* Community-level acceptance rates for biochar-based systems, including social and cultural factors
* Regional variation in effectiveness of biochar applications across different soil types and climates
