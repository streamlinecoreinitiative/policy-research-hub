**Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Mekong Basin: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

The Mekong Basin is home to millions of people living in secondary cities, where water scarcity and climate change pose significant threats to livelihoods. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation as a solution to address these challenges.

### Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

#### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Mekong Basin

The Mekong Basin is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have resulted in severe water scarcity, affecting agriculture, industry, and households.

#### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Mekong Basin rely heavily on boreholes and canals, which are prone to water loss due to evaporation and seepage [verify]. In addition to inefficiencies due to outdated technology and inadequate maintenance, these systems often suffer from inefficiencies. The World Bank reports that renewable energy consumption has been increasing steadily over the past decade in neighboring countries.

#### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry is an ancient practice that combines trees with crops and livestock. By promoting soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, agroforestry can improve water retention and reduce erosion [verify]. Case studies from the region demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in enhancing water availability for irrigation.

#### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology is a small-scale hydroelectric system that harnesses energy from moving water. By integrating micro-hydro with agroforestry, farmers can reduce their reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency [verify]. Pilot projects have shown promising results in terms of cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

#### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Combining agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a holistic approach to addressing water scarcity and climate change. By promoting sustainable agriculture, reducing energy consumption, and increasing water retention, this integrated system can provide climate-resilient irrigation for secondary cities in the Mekong Basin.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale:

1.  Develop policy frameworks that incentivize the integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro technology.
2.  Establish training programs for farmers, technicians, and policymakers to promote capacity building.
3.  Invest in research and development to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of micro-hydro systems.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a comprehensive assessment of water loss from existing irrigation systems in secondary cities in the Mekong Basin [verify].
2.  Develop case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in reducing water scarcity and promoting sustainable energy production.
3.  Establish partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and community organizations to promote the adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

### Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution to address water scarcity and climate change in secondary cities in the Mekong Basin. By promoting sustainable agriculture, reducing energy consumption, and increasing water retention, this approach can protect livelihoods under climate stress. Further research and development are needed to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of micro-hydro systems.
