# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sahel: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Securing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in achieving clean energy access (53.3% of the population) [1] and safe drinking water (73.7% global coverage, but only 53.3% in SSA) [2]. To address these gaps, we recommend implementing comprehensive policies focusing on renewable energy development, improved water infrastructure, and climate adaptation measures.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, with limited access to electricity (53.3%) [1] and clean water severely impacting economic development, health outcomes, and climate resilience [3]. The region's natural environment includes all living and non-living things occurring naturally along with their interactions [4], which are crucial for maintaining ecosystem balance.

## Analysis

Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa is only 19.7%, far below global standards (34% in 2020) [5]. Access to safely managed drinking water stands at 73.7% globally, but drops significantly to 53.3% in SSA [2], highlighting stark disparities. Climate impacts are exacerbated by limited infrastructure and energy access, leading to increased vulnerability.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Develop a national renewable energy strategy**: Invest in solar, wind, and hydro power plants with government subsidies and incentives for private sector participation.
2. **Implement community-based water management systems**: Establish rainwater harvesting ponds and improve maintenance of existing wells and boreholes.
3. **Enhance early warning systems**: Deploy climate smart agriculture practices to mitigate droughts and floods.

## Implementation Considerations

Pilot projects in key regions, secure funding through international aid and private investments. Estimated costs for a comprehensive solar-powered well system per village are approximately [VERIFY] $10 million [6]. Potential barriers include resistance from local communities who may not see immediate benefits and lack of technical expertise.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in securing water security, achieving clean energy access, and adapting to climate change impacts. To address these gaps, we urge governments, NGOs, and international organizations to implement comprehensive policies focusing on renewable energy development, improved water infrastructure, and climate adaptation measures.
