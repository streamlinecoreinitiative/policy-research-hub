# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. To address these issues, we recommend implementing large-scale rainwater harvesting systems across the region to increase access to safe drinking water, promoting renewable energy integration through policy frameworks that incentivize adoption, particularly in off-grid areas, and enhancing climate resilience measures by developing early warning systems for climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate water security, limited clean energy access, and climate vulnerability. According to World Bank data, the region's population lacks safe drinking water at a rate of 32.4% (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1] and electricity at 53.3% (World Bank Open Data, 2023) [2]. Renewable energy consumption is only 19.7%, far below global targets (World Bank Open Data, 2020) [3]. Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing droughts and floods, necessitating resilient adaptation measures.

## Analysis

Recent data indicates that Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in renewable energy consumption compared to global targets set under SDG 7 (World Bank Open Data, 2021). The region's water security is similarly problematic with only [VERIFY] access to safely managed drinking water, well below the world average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1]. Climate change impacts underscore these challenges by increasing extreme weather events and altering rainfall patterns, leading to water scarcity in many areas.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
	* Implement large-scale rainwater harvesting systems across Sub-Saharan Africa.
	* Invest in solar-powered well projects for rural communities.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration**:
	* Establish policy frameworks that incentivize renewable energy adoption, particularly in off-grid areas.
	* Encourage public-private partnerships for solar and wind power infrastructure development.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Measures**:
	* Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters to mitigate their impacts on water security.
	* Support drought-resistant crop varieties that can withstand changing weather patterns.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Funding Mechanisms**:
	* Allocate dedicated funds from national budgets and international aid agencies for these initiatives.
	* Explore public-private financing models, such as green bonds and grants, to support project implementation.
2. **Capacity Building**:
	* Train local communities in water harvesting techniques and renewable energy management.
	* Collaborate with academic institutions to develop curricula focusing on climate resilience and sustainable development practices.

## Conclusion

Addressing Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation requires a multifaceted approach. Immediate policy interventions are necessary to ensure sustainable development and improve public health outcomes. By leveraging existing data and implementing evidence-based recommendations, decision-makers can make meaningful progress towards these critical goals.
