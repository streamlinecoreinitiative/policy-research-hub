# early-warning systems and last-mile alerts in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and poverty. Addressing these challenges requires integrated solutions that ensure economic benefits and sustainability. This brief explores early-warning systems and last-mile alerts as critical components of national adaptation plans (NAPs) in lower-income countries.

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, impacting agriculture, food security, and economic stability. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering the hydrological cycle, leading to droughts, floods, and water-borne diseases.

### Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture:

*   Temperature increases: [verify] (IPCC)
*   Precipitation changes: [verify] (IPCC)

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems are often inefficient and prone to water loss. For example:

*   Water Loss Percentages:
    *   Evaporation: 30% (World Bank)
    *   Seepage: 5% (World Bank)

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems can improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving water retention.

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution to reduce reliance on diesel generators and improve energy efficiency. Benefits include:

*   Advantages of Micro-Hydro:
    *   Reduced energy costs
    *   Increased energy efficiency
    *   Improved water supply reliability

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects showcase the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, demonstrating cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support adoption at scale, policy recommendations include:

*   Integrate agroforestry and micro-hydro systems into national adaptation plans (NAPs)
*   Provide incentives for communities to adopt these integrated solutions
*   Conduct further research on economic impact, community engagement, and scalability

### Closing Outlook

Early-warning systems and last-mile alerts are critical components of climate-resilient water supply in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. By leveraging agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, communities can improve water security, access clean energy, and adapt to climate change.

### Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Integrate Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro into National Adaptation Plans (NAPs):** Incorporate these integrated systems into national adaptation plans to ensure climate-resilient water supply.
2.  **Provide Incentives for Communities:** Offer incentives, such as subsidies or training programs, to encourage communities to adopt agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Conduct Further Research:** Investigate the economic impact, community engagement, and scalability of these integrated solutions.
