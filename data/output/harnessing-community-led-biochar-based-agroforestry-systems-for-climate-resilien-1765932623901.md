**Harnessing Community-led Biochar-based Agroforestry Systems for Climate-Resilient Water Security and Clean Energy Access in Rural Mozambique**

**Executive Summary:**
In rural Mozambique, climate variability poses significant challenges to agriculture, a critical sector that employs millions of people. Integrating biochar into agroforestry systems offers a promising solution to enhance soil health, increase water retention, and improve the resilience of small-scale farmers to climate shocks. This approach also contributes to renewable energy generation through biogas production from agroforestry residues. This brief highlights the potential of community-led biochar-based agroforestry systems for achieving climate-resilient water security and clean energy access in rural Mozambique.

**Climate Resilience in Rural Mozambique**

Rural areas in Mozambique face severe climatic challenges, including droughts, floods, and temperature fluctuations. These events have devastating impacts on agriculture, leading to crop failures, reduced yields, and decreased livelihoods for small-scale farmers (UN FAO, 2020). Climate change projections indicate that these extreme weather events will intensify, further exacerbating the vulnerability of rural communities (World Bank, 2019).

**Biochar and Agroforestry Systems as Lead Interventions**

Biochar is a form of charcoal produced from organic materials through pyrolysis. When applied to soils, biochar improves fertility by increasing water retention capacity, reducing soil erosion, and enhancing nutrient cycling (Lal, 2007). Agroforestry systems combine trees with crops or livestock to promote ecological interactions and synergies between species. Integrating biochar into agroforestry practices can amplify the benefits of both approaches, leading to improved soil health, increased biodiversity, and enhanced ecosystem services.

**Impact on Water Security**

Biochar enhances water retention in soils by increasing the cation exchange capacity and reducing leaching (Lehmann et al., 2003). This leads to more sustainable agricultural systems, as crops require less irrigation and are better adapted to drought conditions. In Mozambique's agricultural regions, soil degradation is a pressing issue, with an estimated 70% of soils suffering from erosion or nutrient depletion (Mozambique Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, 2019).

**Enhancing Renewable Energy Access**

Agroforestry residues can be converted into biogas through anaerobic digestion, providing a clean energy source for cooking, lighting, and heating. Biogas production potential in Mozambique is significant, with an estimated 10-15% of agricultural waste suitable for conversion (World Bank, 2019).

**Economic Benefits and Social Impacts**

Implementing biochar-based agroforestry systems can be cost-effective, with estimates suggesting a return on investment within 5-7 years (Lal et al., 2008). Community-led initiatives can also generate social benefits, including improved livelihoods, enhanced food security, and increased community engagement in natural resource management.

**Challenges and Future Directions**

Key challenges to implementing biochar-based agroforestry systems include lack of awareness among farmers, limited access to technology and resources, and inadequate policy support (Mozambique Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, 2019). To scale up these integrated solutions, further research is needed on long-term economic impact studies and successful implementation models in Mozambique.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support community-led initiatives**: Provide technical assistance, training, and resources to facilitate the adoption of biochar-based agroforestry systems among small-scale farmers.
2. **Develop policy frameworks**: Encourage government agencies to develop policies and regulations that support the integration of biochar into agroforestry practices.
3. **Invest in biogas production infrastructure**: Establish biogas production facilities and distribution networks to increase access to clean energy.

**Closing Outlook:**
Harnessing community-led biochar-based agroforestry systems offers a promising solution for achieving climate-resilient water security and clean energy access in rural Mozambique. By addressing the challenges of soil degradation, water scarcity, and energy poverty through integrated approaches, we can improve livelihoods, enhance ecosystem services, and contribute to sustainable development.
