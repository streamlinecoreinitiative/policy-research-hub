# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region is one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change, facing severe droughts and desertification that threaten food security and livelihoods. Indigenous knowledge plays a crucial role in developing climate-resilient agricultural practices that can be sustained by local communities without external aid. This brief highlights the importance of agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Sudano-Sahelian belt as a means to support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). It explores how indigenous-led agroforestry systems have enhanced resilience to climate change, and discusses policy support mechanisms that can be scaled up through community engagement.

**Climate Challenges in the Sahel Region**

The Sahel region spans across 13 countries in West Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Eritrea in the east. The region is characterized by a semi-arid climate with high temperatures and low rainfall, making it prone to droughts and desertification. Climate variability has increased in recent decades, with drought frequency and intensity affecting agriculture and food security.

*   Droughts have become more frequent, lasting longer than 6 months in some areas.
*   Desertification is accelerating, leading to soil degradation and loss of biodiversity.
*   Agriculture, which accounts for 60% of the region's GDP, is severely impacted by climate change.

**Indigenous Knowledge as a Resource for Climate-Resilient Agriculture**

Local farmers have historically used traditional practices to adapt to arid conditions. These practices include:

*   Crop rotation and intercropping to improve soil fertility and reduce erosion.
*   Mulching and cover cropping to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
*   Use of drought-resistant crops such as sorghum, millet, and cowpeas.

Examples of successful indigenous agricultural techniques can be found in the following case studies:

*   In Senegal, farmers use a technique called "zai" to plant seeds in small pits filled with compost, reducing soil erosion and increasing water retention.
*   In Mali, farmers practice "agroforestry" by integrating trees into their crop fields, improving soil health and providing shade for crops.

**Scaling Indigenous Solutions through Community Engagement**

To scale up indigenous solutions, it is essential to involve local communities in the adoption and promotion of traditional practices. Mechanisms such as:

*   Community-based organizations (CBOs) can facilitate knowledge transfer and provide support services to farmers.
*   Farmer field schools (FFS) can be established to train farmers on new techniques and promote exchange of experiences.
*   Participatory research methods can be used to involve farmers in the design and implementation of projects.

**Policy Support for Indigenous Agriculture**

Policies that recognize and support traditional agricultural practices are crucial for scaling up indigenous-led agroforestry value chains. Examples from Sahelian countries include:

*   Senegal's "Green Belt Initiative" aims to promote agroforestry and improve soil fertility through community-led initiatives.
*   Mali's "National Strategy for Sustainable Agriculture" integrates indigenous techniques into national development strategies.

**Challenges and Opportunities Ahead**

While there are many opportunities for scaling up indigenous-led agricultural innovations, several challenges need to be addressed:

*   Lack of infrastructure, such as roads and storage facilities, hinders the adoption of new technologies.
*   Limited access to markets and finance restricts farmers' ability to invest in climate-resilient practices.
*   Climate change impacts on traditional farming methods require innovative solutions.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  **Support community-led initiatives**: Provide financial and technical support to CBOs, FFS, and other community-driven projects that promote indigenous agricultural techniques.
2.  **Develop policy frameworks**: Encourage governments to develop policies that recognize and support traditional agricultural practices, such as agroforestry value chains for cash crops.
3.  **Invest in capacity building**: Provide training and technical assistance to farmers, extension agents, and policymakers on climate-resilient agriculture and indigenous knowledge systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sahel region is at the forefront of climate change impacts, but it also holds significant potential for innovation and adaptation. By harnessing indigenous knowledge and promoting agroforestry value chains for cash crops, we can support adaptation targets in NDCs and improve food security and livelihoods for millions of people. It is essential to address the challenges ahead through community engagement, policy support, and capacity building.
