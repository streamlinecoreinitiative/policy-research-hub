# Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

## Executive Summary

This brief focuses on two critical areas of environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security and climate adaptation. The Sahel region's vulnerability to heat stress due to climate change highlights the need for innovative solutions like urban green roofs. In the Andean Highlands, frequent floods pose significant health risks among vulnerable populations, emphasizing the importance of flood-resilient transport corridors. This document provides a comprehensive overview of these challenges, successful implementation examples, and key data points needed to inform policy decisions.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Case Studies

### Urban Green Roofs for Resilience in the Sahel Region

The Sahel region is facing severe heat stress due to climate change, which poses significant risks to human health and agricultural productivity. Implementing green roofs can help mitigate these impacts by providing cooling surfaces that reduce urban temperatures.

#### Background on Green Roofs

Green roofs are designed to provide insulation, reduce stormwater runoff, and create habitats for local wildlife. They have been successfully implemented in various regions, including Europe and North America, where they have shown significant reductions in urban heat island effects.

#### Case Study: Successful Implementation of Urban Green Roofs in a Sahelian City

A detailed case study on the implementation of green roofs in a city within the Sahel region is crucial. This section should include:

* Cost-benefit analysis
* Community feedback and engagement levels
* Technical assistance provided by local governments or international organizations

#### Evidence Needed

To inform policy decisions, data on temperature reduction effects of green roofs, public health outcomes (e.g., heat-related illnesses), and economic impacts (cost savings for cooling costs) are essential.

### Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Andean Highlands

The Andes are prone to frequent floods, which not only disrupt transportation but also lead to severe health issues among vulnerable populations such as children and elderly residents. Building flood-resilient infrastructure can improve emergency response times and reduce exposure risks.

#### Case Study: Successful Implementation of Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Andean Highlands

A detailed case study on a successful implementation project is crucial, highlighting its impact on community health outcomes (e.g., reduced waterborne diseases).

## Key Data Points Needed

To inform policy decisions and ensure effective implementation, the following data points are essential:

### Urban Green Roofs for Resilience in the Sahel Region

* Average temperature reductions achieved by green roofs in Sahelian cities
* Reductions in urban heat island effect metrics (e.g., air temperatures)
* Number of heat-related illness cases prevented due to cooler urban environments
* Cost savings per city for cooling costs, including maintenance and operational expenses

### Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Andean Highlands

* Reductions in waterborne disease incidence rates attributed to flood-resilient infrastructure projects
* Time saved during evacuation processes due to improved drainage systems or bridges
* Cost savings on emergency response operations compared to pre-flood conditions

## Official Sources and Data Gaps

Official sources:

* World Health Organization (WHO) - Global Burden of Disease Study
* United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
* Local Sahelian government environmental departments

Data gaps:

### Urban Green Roofs for Resilience in the Sahel Region

* Specific cost estimates for green roof implementation in Sahelian cities
* Detailed health outcomes data from case studies or pilot projects
* Long-term economic impacts on businesses and public services due to reduced heat stress

### Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Andean Highlands

* Specific economic impacts of flood mitigation projects, including cost-effectiveness analysis
* Longitudinal health outcomes data tracking community resilience over time
* Information on the involvement and engagement levels of local communities in project planning and maintenance efforts

## Actions/Recommendations

1. **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** for implementing urban green roofs and flood-resilient transport corridors in lower-income countries.
2. **Establish partnerships** between local governments, international organizations, and private sectors to support implementation efforts.
3. **Conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses** of these projects to inform policy decisions.
4. **Engage local communities** in project planning and maintenance efforts to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Closing Outlook

Environmental resilience is critical for lower-income countries facing climate-related challenges. Implementing innovative solutions like urban green roofs and flood-resilient transport corridors can significantly improve human health outcomes, reduce economic losses, and enhance community resilience. By addressing the data gaps and providing evidence-based recommendations, this brief aims to inform policy decisions and support effective implementation of these critical environmental resilience initiatives.
