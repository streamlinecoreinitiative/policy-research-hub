**Bridging Water Security Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa through Renewable Energy and Climate Resilience**

## Executive Summary

The lack of safe drinking water and reliable electricity hinders economic development and health outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. To address this crisis, we recommend investing $10 to $50 per household (World Bank, 2024) [VERIFY] in community-based water projects that prioritize safely managed drinking water for all communities. This investment will not only improve living conditions but also contribute to broader development goals.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges with water security and climate resilience. With less than one-third of the region's inhabitants having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), millions remain at risk from waterborne diseases. Similarly, only about half of Sub-Saharan African households have access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). These disparities not only impact daily living conditions but also impede economic growth and sustainable development.

The region's renewable energy consumption is particularly low at just 19.7% (World Bank, 2020), indicating significant potential for increasing clean energy use. However, the challenges of water security and climate resilience remain acute. For instance, Sub-Saharan Africa hosts some of the world's most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods.

## Analysis

The region’s lack of safe drinking water is a pressing issue, with 2.2 billion people globally lacking access to safely managed water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), compared to the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data). Similarly, while 53.3% of Sub-Saharan African households have access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), this is significantly lower than the global average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Access to Safe Drinking Water:** Implement water treatment plants and promote community-based water management systems that prioritize safe drinking water for all communities (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). Increase investment in sanitation infrastructure like latrines and hygiene promotion programs.

   - Data Point: "Global population lacking safe water" is estimated at 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

2. **Enhance Renewable Energy Use:** Encourage the adoption of solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting technologies to improve access to clean energy for households and small businesses.

   - Data Point: Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy consumption is only 19.7% (World Bank, 2020).

3. **Climate Resilience Programs:** Invest in early-warning systems and climate adaptation projects that help communities cope with extreme weather events and other climate-related risks.

4. **Community-Based Initiatives:** Foster local initiatives where community members are involved in planning and implementation of water security and clean energy projects to ensure sustainability and ownership.

   - Data Point: World Bank data indicates 53.3% of Sub-Saharan African households have access to electricity (World Bank, 2023).

## Implementation Considerations

- **Budget Allocation:** Allocate a specific percentage of the national budget towards water security and renewable energy initiatives, ensuring these funds are effectively utilized.
   
   - Cost Estimate: Estimated cost for implementing community-based water projects could range from $10 to $50 per household (World Bank, 2024) [VERIFY].

- **Technical Support:** Provide technical support and training to local authorities and communities on the proper use of renewable energy technologies.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address its water security and climate resilience challenges. By expanding access to safe drinking water through community-based initiatives and enhancing renewable energy use with solar-powered solutions, the region can pave the way towards a more sustainable future. Strengthening these efforts will not only improve living conditions but also contribute to broader development goals.
