# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Horn of Africa: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Bridging Water Security Gaps with Climate Adaptation Strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles to provide safe drinking water (32.4% access) and electricity (53.3% access) to its population, exacerbating the challenges posed by climate variability [1]. To bridge this gap, we recommend strengthening public-private partnerships for clean cooking, expanding solar-powered irrigation systems, enhancing early warning systems, and integrating climate adaptation into national development plans.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) compared to other regions, with rural areas being particularly underserved [1]. Climate variability leads to erratic rainfall patterns, increasing demand for clean energy sources like solar and wind [2]. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims for universal access to safe water by 2030; current progress is far from this target.

## Analysis

Evidence shows that Sub-Saharan Africa's reliance on fossil fuels poses significant risks due to climate impacts, including droughts and floods [3]. Climate models predict increased frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall in the region, which can further strain water resources and energy supplies [4]. Current policies often fail to address intersectional issues like integrated water resource management (IWRM) and climate change adaptation.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Solar-Powered Irrigation Systems**: Implement solar-powered drip irrigation systems to reduce water loss and increase crop yields in semi-arid regions. This can be achieved through partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private companies [5].
2. **Enhance Early Warning Systems**: Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods using satellite imagery and ground-based sensors to provide timely alerts to communities. This can be done in collaboration with national meteorological agencies and international organizations such as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) [6].
3. **Integrate Climate Change into Water Policy**: Update water policies to include climate change adaptation measures, ensuring that future plans are resilient to projected changes in precipitation and temperature [7].
4. **Promote Clean Cooking Technologies**: Scale up clean cooking solutions like biogas digesters and solar cookers to reduce indoor air pollution and deforestation caused by traditional open fires. This can be achieved through partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private companies, as well as through subsidies for low-income households [8].

## Implementation Considerations

Budgetary constraints may pose a challenge in implementing these interventions; prioritizing low-cost solutions like community-managed water points can be effective [9]. Coordination with local governments and NGOs is crucial to ensure projects are tailored to specific needs and sustainable over the long term.

## Conclusion

To achieve climate-resilient water security, Sub-Saharan African countries must adopt multifaceted approaches that combine technological innovations, policy reforms, and community engagement. Immediate action can help mitigate future crises and improve living standards for millions of vulnerable individuals.
