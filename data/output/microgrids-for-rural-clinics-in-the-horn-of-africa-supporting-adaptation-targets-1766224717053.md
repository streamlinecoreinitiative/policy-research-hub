**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Horn of Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant challenges to rural communities in the Horn of Africa, where water scarcity and unreliable energy supply exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. This brief explores the potential of microgrids integrated with renewable energy sources and climate-resilient irrigation systems for supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By examining case studies from agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in similar regions, we identify key lessons for scaling up climate-resilient water supply solutions in the Horn of Africa.

**Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity in the Horn of Africa**

The Horn of Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events threaten agricultural productivity, food security, and economic stability. [Verify] water scarcity affects many rural communities, relying on unreliable boreholes or distant water sources.

**Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Horn of Africa often rely on diesel generators, which are expensive to operate and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. These systems also suffer from high water loss through evaporation and seepage, reducing their efficiency and effectiveness.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Climate-Resilient Solution**

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems have been successfully implemented in similar regions, providing a climate-resilient solution for irrigation. These integrated systems combine the benefits of agroforestry (soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration) with the efficiency of small-scale hydroelectric power generation.

**Policy Recommendations**

To support the adoption of microgrids and climate-resilient irrigation systems in the Horn of Africa:

1.  **Develop policies that incentivize renewable energy investments**, such as tax breaks or grants for businesses and individuals investing in solar, wind, or hydroelectric power.
2.  **Establish training programs for local communities** to ensure they have the skills needed to maintain and operate microgrids and climate-resilient irrigation systems.
3.  Conduct further research on the economic benefits of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1.  Develop a comprehensive policy framework that supports the adoption of microgrids and climate-resilient irrigation systems in the Horn of Africa.
2.  Establish partnerships between local governments, international organizations, and private sector companies to facilitate the implementation of these solutions.
3.  Conduct further research on the socioeconomic benefits of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

**Closing Outlook**

The Horn of Africa faces significant climate-related challenges that require innovative solutions. By leveraging the potential of microgrids integrated with renewable energy sources and climate-resilient irrigation systems, we can support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs and improve the lives of rural communities.
