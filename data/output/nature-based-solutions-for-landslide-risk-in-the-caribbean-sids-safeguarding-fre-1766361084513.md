# Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in Caribbean SIDS: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant threats to water security and climate adaptation in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Caribbean. This brief highlights nature-based solutions for landslide risk management, focusing on safeguarding freshwater ecosystems through integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems.

## Introduction

Climate change impacts agriculture in SIDS, characterized by erratic rainfall patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events [verify]. The Caribbean region is particularly vulnerable due to its geography, with steep terrain and dense population centers. Freshwater ecosystems are essential for human consumption, agriculture, and ecosystem services but face significant threats from landslides, droughts, and water pollution.

## Current Water Management Practices

Traditional irrigation methods in SIDS are often energy-intensive and costly [verify]. Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy, while canal systems experience water loss due to evaporation and seepage. The economic burden on smallholder farmers is substantial, with costs ranging from $100-$200 per hectare.

## Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk Management

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration [verify]. Benefits of agroforestry include:

• Soil organic matter increases by 2-8% [verify]
• Biodiversity increase is reported in various studies, but specific numbers are not provided
• Carbon sequestration rates vary widely depending on factors such as tree species and climate

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Renewable Energy and Water Management

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators [verify]. Specific data includes:

• Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system
• Energy efficiency is reported to be around 70-80%
• Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods are not quantified

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up [verify]. Cost estimates and financial viability analysis include:

• Total project cost per hectare is estimated at $10,000-$25,000
• Return on investment (ROI) is reported to be 3-5 years in some studies

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions [verify]. Recommended policies include:

• Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
• Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
• Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

## Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop policy frameworks to support the implementation of nature-based solutions for landslide risk management.
3. Establish partnerships with international organizations and local stakeholders to promote knowledge sharing and capacity building.

## Closing Outlook

Nature-based solutions offer a promising approach to address landslide risk in Caribbean SIDS, safeguarding freshwater ecosystems and promoting sustainable development. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can reduce water scarcity and increase energy efficiency. Further research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability.
