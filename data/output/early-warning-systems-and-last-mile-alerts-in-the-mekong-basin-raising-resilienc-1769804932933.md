**Early-Warning Systems and Last-Mile Alerts in the Mekong Basin: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

To bridge water security gaps, governments should prioritize integrating renewable energy solutions into national development plans. This brief outlines actionable steps to ensure both immediate benefits and long-term resilience. The primary policy recommendation is to strengthen national energy policies by developing comprehensive renewable energy strategies that prioritize clean, decentralized solutions.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in providing safe water and electricity, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and 53.3% having access to electricity (World Bank Open Data). These figures highlight a critical gap in basic human needs.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa has only [VERIFY] % of the population with access to safely managed drinking water, far below the global average (73.7%) (World Bank Open Data).
- **Energy Access**: Electricity access is even more challenging, with just 53.3% of the population having access in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to 91.6% globally (World Bank Open Data). Renewable energy can play a pivotal role by providing reliable and sustainable power sources.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Strengthen National Energy Policies**: Develop comprehensive national renewable energy policies that prioritize clean, decentralized solutions such as solar-powered desalination plants for water treatment.
2. **Invest in Rural Electrification Programs**: Allocate specific funding to electrify rural areas using off-grid renewable technologies like solar mini-grids and biogas systems.
3. **Support Community-Based Initiatives**: Encourage community-led projects that focus on clean cooking solutions, such as solar stoves and biomass cookers, which can reduce indoor air pollution and energy costs.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Initial investments in renewable infrastructure will be substantial but offset by long-term savings from reduced dependence on fossil fuels.
- **Barriers**: Potential resistance from entrenched power monopolies and regulatory hurdles need to be addressed through targeted policy reforms and public-private partnerships.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a coordinated, multi-faceted approach. By leveraging renewable energy solutions, governments can create sustainable pathways out of poverty while reducing environmental degradation.

### Background Information

**Environment**

The natural environment refers to all living and non-living things occurring naturally, including physical and biological factors along with their chemical interactions that impact on any organism or a group of organisms (Wikipedia).

**Resilience**

Resilience refers to the ability of an ecosystem, community, or individual to withstand and recover from disturbances or stressors (Wikipedia).
