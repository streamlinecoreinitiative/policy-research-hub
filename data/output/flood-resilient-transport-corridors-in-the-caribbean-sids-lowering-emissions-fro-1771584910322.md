**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Caribbean SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To mitigate the impacts of climate change on transportation infrastructure in the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we recommend prioritizing flood-resilient transport corridors. This can be achieved through a combination of upgrading existing infrastructure and implementing new designs that incorporate green infrastructure, such as green roofs, rain gardens, and permeable pavements. By investing in these measures, Caribbean SIDS can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by [VERIFY] 20% by 2025 (World Bank, 2022). This is a critical step towards achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C.

## Context & Challenge

The Caribbean region is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its geographical location and limited resources. Rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, and more frequent flooding are expected to worsen in the coming years (IPCC, 2021). The transportation sector in the Caribbean SIDS is particularly susceptible to these impacts, with many roads and bridges already experiencing damage from extreme weather events. According to the World Bank (2022), the region's transportation infrastructure is responsible for approximately [VERIFY] 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.

## Analysis

The current state of transportation infrastructure in the Caribbean SIDS is characterized by a lack of flood-resilient design, inadequate maintenance, and insufficient investment in green infrastructure. This has resulted in significant economic losses due to damage from extreme weather events (World Bank, 2022). In contrast, countries that have invested in flood-resilient transport corridors have seen reduced costs associated with maintenance and repair (UNESCAP, 2019).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Develop a National Flood-Resilient Transport Corridor Plan**: Each Caribbean SIDS country should develop a comprehensive plan to upgrade existing transportation infrastructure and incorporate green infrastructure into new designs.
2. **Increase Funding for Green Infrastructure**: Governments and international donors should prioritize funding for green infrastructure, such as green roofs, rain gardens, and permeable pavements.
3. **Implement Flood-Resilient Design Standards**: Transportation agencies should adopt flood-resilient design standards for all new transportation projects.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require significant investment in both human resources and financial capital. Governments can leverage international funding mechanisms, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), to support the development of flood-resilient transport corridors.

## Conclusion

The Caribbean SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts on transportation infrastructure. By prioritizing flood-resilient transport corridors, these countries can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate economic losses associated with extreme weather events. We urge governments and international donors to prioritize investment in green infrastructure and adopt flood-resilient design standards for all new transportation projects.
