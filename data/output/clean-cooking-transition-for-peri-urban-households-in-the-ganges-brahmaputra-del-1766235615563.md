# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: raising resilience finance for communities

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

### Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces significant environmental challenges due to climate change, affecting millions of peri-urban households. This brief explores the transition to clean cooking practices as a crucial component of resilience finance in these communities.

### Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

#### Overview

Climate change has severe implications for lower-income countries, particularly those with limited access to clean energy and water resources. The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a prime example of this phenomenon, where rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns threaten the livelihoods of millions.

*   **Water Scarcity:** Erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures lead to severe water scarcity.
*   **Food Security:** Reduced crop yields and decreased agricultural productivity compromise food security for peri-urban households.
*   **Economic Stability:** Climate-related shocks undermine economic stability, exacerbating poverty and inequality.

#### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta face significant challenges:

*   **Boreholes and Canals:** These traditional methods are often inefficient, prone to water loss through evaporation and seepage.
*   **Diesel Generators:** Relying on diesel generators for energy increases costs and environmental degradation.

#### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems offer numerous benefits:

*   **Soil Health:** Tree cover improves soil health, increasing water retention and reducing erosion.
*   **Biodiversity:** Diversified tree species enhance biodiversity, supporting ecosystem services.
*   **Carbon Sequestration:** Agroforestry systems sequester carbon, mitigating climate change impacts.

#### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution:

*   **Energy Efficiency:** Small-scale hydroelectric systems reduce energy reliance on diesel generators and increase efficiency.
*   **Water Conservation:** By harnessing local water resources, micro-hydro systems conserve water, minimizing evaporation and seepage.

#### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects demonstrate the combined potential of agroforestry and micro-hydro:

*   **Case Studies:** Successful integration of these technologies improves water security, reduces energy reliance, and increases economic stability.
*   **Economic Analysis:** Cost-effectiveness and scalability of integrated systems support policy recommendations.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support widespread adoption of clean cooking practices in peri-urban households, we recommend:

1.  **Policy Frameworks:** Establish supportive policies for agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, including incentives for investment and training programs.
2.  **Capacity Building:** Develop capacity building initiatives to enhance community engagement, project planning, and implementation.
3.  **Research Directions:** Investigate the economic impact of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects on local communities and explore opportunities for scaling up.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Support policy frameworks** that promote investment in agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2.  **Develop capacity building initiatives** to enhance community engagement, project planning, and implementation.
3.  **Investigate economic impact** of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects on local communities.

### Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices in peri-urban households is crucial for raising resilience finance in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we can improve water security, reduce energy reliance, and increase economic stability. Policy recommendations and future research directions will support widespread adoption of these integrated solutions, ultimately enhancing the resilience of lower-income communities to climate-related shocks.
