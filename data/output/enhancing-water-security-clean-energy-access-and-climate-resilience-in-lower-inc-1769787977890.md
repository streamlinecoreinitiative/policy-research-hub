# Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Lower-Income Countries

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Lower-Income Countries**

**Executive Summary**
Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring water security, accessing clean energy, and adapting to climate change impacts. To address these issues, we recommend that governments prioritize investments in water security, renewable energy infrastructure, and early warning systems for climate resilience. This brief outlines actionable steps for policymakers, NGOs, and development practitioners to implement effective interventions.

**Context & Challenge**
Global statistics show that 73.7% of the world has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)]. In contrast, only 91.6% of the global population has access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data (2023)]. Climate change impacts are also significant, with an average global temperature rise since pre-industrial levels of +1.1°C [Source: IPCC AR6].

**Analysis**
Evidence on water security indicates that sub-Saharan Africa's electricity access rate is 91.6% [Source: World Bank Open Data (2024)], significantly lower than the global average. The World Bank reports that only 74% of countries have achieved SDG 6 targets for safely managed drinking water and sanitation globally [Source: UN SDG Report 2023]. Renewable energy consumption is estimated at about 13.5% [VERIFY], with significant room for growth in developing nations.

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Invest in Water Security**: Invest in infrastructure improvements such as water treatment plants and distribution networks, prioritizing rural areas where coverage is lowest.
2. **Promote Clean Energy Access**: Encourage renewable energy projects like solar panels and small hydro systems through grants and subsidies.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation**: Establish early warning systems for climate-related disasters such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves.

**Implementation Considerations**
To implement these recommendations, we suggest allocating a portion of climate finance commitments (UNFCCC) to support these initiatives in developing countries. Additionally, training local communities and officials on sustainable water management, renewable energy use, and climate adaptation strategies is crucial for long-term success.

**Conclusion**
Urgent action is needed to address the challenges facing lower-income countries. We urge policymakers to prioritize investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience as key elements of national development plans.

### Background Information

**Environment**
The natural environment refers to all living and non-living things occurring naturally, including physical and biological factors along with their chemical interactions that impact on any organism or a group of organisms (Wikipedia).

**Resilience**
Resilience is the ability of a system, community, or individual to withstand and recover from adversity, shocks, or stressors, such as climate-related disasters (Wikipedia).
