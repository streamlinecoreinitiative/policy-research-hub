# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Policy Brief**

**Executive Summary**

Lower-income countries face unique environmental challenges that threaten their development prospects. This policy brief examines the critical issues of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in these countries. It highlights the importance of sustainable water management, transitioning to clean energy sources, and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure. Based on available data and analysis, this brief provides policy recommendations for governments, international organizations, and stakeholders to enhance environmental resilience in lower-income countries.

**Section 1: Introduction to Environmental Challenges in Lower-Income Countries**

Lower-income countries face significant environmental challenges due to limited resources and infrastructure. According to the UN Water, approximately [verify] of the population in these countries lacks access to clean water. Desertification affects [verify] of land in these regions, exacerbating soil degradation and reducing agricultural productivity.

**Section 2: Water Security**

Sustainable water management is crucial for ensuring food security and public health. The annual water scarcity index for the region stands at [verify], indicating a significant challenge. Approximately [verify] people live without access to safe drinking water, highlighting the need for improved water infrastructure and services.

**Section 5: Policy Recommendations**

Based on the analysis above, we recommend:

1. **Invest in sustainable water management**: Increase funding for water infrastructure and services to ensure access to clean drinking water.
2. **Promote renewable energy transition**: Encourage investment in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
3. **Develop climate-resilient infrastructure**: Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, including sea walls, green roofs, and early warning systems for extreme weather events.

**Sources to Consult**

* OECD Environmental Performance Reviews
* National Governments' Official Publications (e.g., Ministries of Environment)

**Section 6: Monitoring and Evaluation**

Tracking progress towards environmental resilience goals is essential. We recommend:

1. **Establish annual reporting mechanisms**: Regularly report on water security initiatives, renewable energy deployment status, and climate adaptation efforts.
2. **Conduct regular assessments**: Conduct regular assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of policies and programs in enhancing environmental resilience.

* National Environmental Management Agencies

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Governments: Increase funding for sustainable water management, renewable energy transition, and climate-resilient infrastructure.
2. International Organizations: Provide technical assistance and capacity-building support to lower-income countries.
3. Stakeholders: Encourage public-private partnerships for clean energy projects and invest in environmental resilience initiatives.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience is critical for the development prospects of lower-income countries. By investing in sustainable water management, transitioning to clean energy sources, and developing climate-resilient infrastructure, these countries can enhance their ability to adapt to climate change and ensure a more prosperous future for their citizens.
