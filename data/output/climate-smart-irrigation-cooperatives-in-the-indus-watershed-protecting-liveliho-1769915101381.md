# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Indus watershed: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Resilience in Central America: A Comprehensive Policy Blueprint**

## Executive Summary

To address the critical challenges facing Central American countries in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Indus watershed. These cooperatives will enhance water security by promoting efficient use of available water resources, increase clean energy access through the adoption of renewable energy sources, and bolster climate resilience by providing a sustainable livelihood for communities affected by climate stress.

## Context & Challenge

Central America is characterized by its diverse ecosystems and climate variability, leading to frequent droughts and floods. The region's limited access to clean water (32% of the population has access) [1] and electricity (53% have access) exacerbates existing vulnerabilities [2]. A recent study indicates that 41% of the population lacks safe drinking water, with only 8% accessing safely managed facilities [3]. Additionally, renewable energy consumption stands at just 14.8%, far below global targets [4].

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Central America's limited access to safe drinking water (32%) is a significant concern, impacting public health and economic development. According to UN-Water/WHO, 2.2 billion people globally lack safe water [5], with 41% of the population in this region lacking such facilities [3].
- **Clean Energy Access**: The region's electricity access rate at 53% remains far below global standards (91.6%) [6]. Sub-Saharan Africa's electricity penetration is notably higher (53.3%), highlighting a substantial gap for Central American countries.
- **Renewable Energy Consumption**: With only 14.8% of total final energy consumption coming from renewable sources, Central America lags behind the world average (19.7%) [4].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**:
	* Partner with local communities to develop and implement climate-resilient irrigation systems.
	* Promote efficient use of available water resources through the adoption of drip irrigation and other water-saving technologies.
	* Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers on climate-smart agriculture practices.
2. **Increase Electrification Rates**:
	* Target electrification for rural areas, focusing on off-grid solar systems.
	* Utilize public-private partnerships (PPP) to finance these projects and provide subsidies for low-income households.
3. **Boost Renewable Energy Consumption**:
	* Encourage the use of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
	* Establish feed-in tariffs and tax incentives for renewable energy producers.

## Implementation Considerations

The feasibility of these interventions depends on various factors:

- **Costs**: Initial investments in water infrastructure and renewable energy projects could be substantial but are offset by long-term cost savings from reduced healthcare expenses related to contaminated water and lower operational costs for electricity.
- **Barriers**: Political resistance, lack of funding, and technical expertise may pose challenges. Address these through capacity-building programs for local governments and community engagement initiatives.

## Conclusion

By implementing the recommended policy interventions, Central American countries can significantly improve their water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. This comprehensive policy blueprint serves as a practical guide for policymakers to achieve SDG 6 targets by 2030 and secure sustainable futures for all citizens.
