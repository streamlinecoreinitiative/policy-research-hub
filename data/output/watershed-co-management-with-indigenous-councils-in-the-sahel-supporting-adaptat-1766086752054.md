# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to communities in the West African Highlands, affecting their basic needs such as electricity, clean water, and agricultural productivity. Micro-hydro turbines offer a promising solution by providing renewable energy for lighting and pumping, improving irrigation, and enhancing community resilience. This brief highlights the potential of micro-hydro systems in addressing climate-related challenges and contributing to economic development and social welfare.

## Climate Change Impacts on West African Highlands

Climate change is exacerbating existing vulnerabilities in the West African Highlands. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are leading to:

* Increased frequency and severity of droughts
* More frequent and intense floods, causing damage to infrastructure and agricultural lands
* Changes in growing seasons and crop yields, affecting agricultural productivity

These impacts have significant consequences for rural communities, including limited access to electricity, water supply issues, and reduced agricultural productivity.
