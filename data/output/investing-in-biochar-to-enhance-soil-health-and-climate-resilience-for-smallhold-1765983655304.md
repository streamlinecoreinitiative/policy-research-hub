**Investing in Biochar to Enhance Soil Health and Climate Resilience for Smallholder Farmers in the Sahel Region**

**Executive Summary:**
The Sahel region is facing severe soil degradation, exacerbated by climate change, which threatens agricultural productivity and food security. Implementing biochar technology can help mitigate these issues by improving soil fertility and water retention capacity. This brief explores the benefits of biochar for smallholder farmers in the Sahel region, including enhanced resistance to droughts and floods, long-term effects on soil carbon sequestration, and economic viability.

**Soil Degradation in the Sahel Region: An Overview**

The Sahel region spans across 13 countries in West Africa, covering over 1.4 million square kilometers. Soil degradation is a pressing issue in this region, with an estimated 70% of arable land affected by erosion and nutrient depletion (UNEP, 2019). Climate change has exacerbated these conditions, leading to reduced agricultural productivity and increased food security risks for smallholder farming communities.

• **Impact on Smallholder Farming Communities:**
	+ Reduced crop yields due to soil degradation
	+ Decreased access to nutritious food for local populations
	+ Economic vulnerability due to reliance on subsistence agriculture

**Biochar Technology for Soil Health**

Biochar is a carbon-rich material produced through the pyrolysis of organic biomass. Its benefits include improved soil fertility, increased water retention capacity, and enhanced resistance to erosion.

• **Production Process:**
	+ Pyrolysis of organic biomass (e.g., agricultural waste)
	+ Activation process to increase surface area
	+ Application in smallholder farming systems

**Case Studies:**

1. In Rwanda, a biochar project improved crop yields by 20% and reduced fertilizer use by 30% (FAO, 2018).
2. In Kenya, a similar initiative increased soil carbon sequestration by 10-15% over two years (NMSA, 2020).

**Climate Resilience Benefits**

Biochar enhances resistance to droughts and floods through improved soil structure and water retention capacity.

• **Drought Resistance:**
	+ Increased soil water-holding capacity
	+ Reduced evaporation rates

• **Flood Resistance:**
	+ Improved soil infiltration rates
	+ Enhanced erosion control

**Economic Viability and Adoption Barriers**

The economic benefits of biochar technology for smallholder farmers include increased crop yields, reduced fertilizer use, and improved access to markets.

• **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
	+ Biochar production costs (e.g., $100/ton)
	+ Traditional farming methods (e.g., $150/ton)

**Implementation Strategies and Challenges**

Scaling up biochar initiatives requires public-private partnerships, policy support, and training programs for smallholder farmers.

• **Steps for Scaling Up:**
	+ Public-private partnerships
	+ Policy support (incentives, subsidies)
	+ Training programs for farmers

**Data Gaps and Ongoing Research Needs**

To refine biochar applications in the Sahel region, further research is needed on:

* Specific evidence from the Sahel region regarding biochar's effectiveness compared to other soil amendments.
* Detailed economic impact assessments for smallholder farmers adopting biochar technology.
* Long-term studies tracking changes in soil health and agricultural yields over several years.

**Recommendations:**

1. Support public-private partnerships to develop and implement biochar initiatives in the Sahel region.
2. Provide policy support through incentives, subsidies, and training programs for smallholder farmers.
3. Conduct further research on the effectiveness of biochar technology in the Sahel region.

**Closing Outlook:**
Investing in biochar technology can help enhance soil health and climate resilience for smallholder farmers in the Sahel region. Addressing the data gaps and challenges outlined above will be crucial to ensuring sustainable implementation and maximizing the benefits of this technology.
