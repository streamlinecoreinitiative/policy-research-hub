# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Great Lakes region: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Great Lakes Region: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant challenges to rural communities worldwide, particularly those in lower-income countries where resources are scarce and infrastructure is limited. In regions such as the Ethiopian Highlands, climate change impacts agriculture, causing erratic rainfall patterns. This brief presents an innovative solution that integrates agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to address water scarcity while promoting climate resilience.

**Addressing Water Scarcity through Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems**

### Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change affects agriculture in the Ethiopian Highlands, leading to erratic rainfall patterns. The region experiences variable precipitation, but specific data on average annual rainfall and variability is needed (Needed Evidence: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Ethiopia).

### Current Irrigation Practices

Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, consuming significant amounts of energy (10-20 kWh/day) and resulting in losses through evaporation and seepage.

### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits include:

* Soil Organic Matter Increases: [verify]
* Biodiversity Increase: [verify] native species
* Carbon Sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year (Needed Evidence: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from agroforestry)

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, with power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system. These systems achieve high energy efficiency (70-80%) and cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a cost-effective solution for climate-resilient water supply. Key data points include:

* Total Project Cost per hectare: [verify] $10,000-$25,000
* Return on Investment (ROI): 3-5 years
* Long-Term Sustainability Assessments

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems. Key recommendations include:

* Subsidies for Farmers: Incentives provided to encourage adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Grid Integration: Grid integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure Development: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements

### Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct local surveys and case studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop a policy framework that incentivizes the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems through subsidies for farmers and grid integration.
3. Invest in infrastructure development, including roads, storage facilities, and other essential infrastructure.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed solution offers a comprehensive approach to addressing water scarcity while promoting climate resilience in regions such as the Ethiopian Highlands. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, communities can reduce their reliance on traditional irrigation methods, improve soil health, and increase carbon sequestration. We recommend that policymakers and stakeholders prioritize investments in this innovative solution to support adaptation targets in NDCs and ensure a more resilient future for rural communities worldwide.
