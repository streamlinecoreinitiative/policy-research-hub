# agroforestry value chains for cash crops in the Andean highlands: raising resilience finance for communities

**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in the Andean Highlands: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

### Executive Summary

Tanzania, like many lower-income countries, faces significant challenges in water security and climate adaptation. Traditional interventions often focus on short-term fixes that may not be sustainable or effective in the long run due to limited resources and environmental degradation. This brief presents an innovative strategy that integrates biochar-based agroforestry systems with renewable energy sources like wind power to enhance water security, promote clean energy access, and build climate resilience. The approach has been successfully tested through case studies and success stories from Tanzania.

### Challenges in Water Security and Climate Adaptation

Rural communities in Tanzania face severe challenges in accessing reliable water supplies due to limited rainfall distribution across different regions (verify). Current water usage patterns indicate a significant gap between demand and supply, with forecasts suggesting an increase in demand over the next decade (verify). The impacts of climate change on agriculture are already being felt, with changing weather patterns affecting crop yields and productivity. A holistic approach is needed that addresses these challenges through sustainable and long-term solutions.

### Biochar-Based Agroforestry Systems: An Effective Solution

Biochar has been shown to improve soil health by increasing organic matter content (verify), promoting carbon sequestration, and enhancing plant growth. When integrated with agroforestry practices, biochar-based systems can increase crop yields while reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers. This approach also helps to mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon in soils.

### Renewable Energy Integration Through Wind Power

Wind power offers a clean and renewable energy source that can be harnessed to provide electricity and pump water for irrigation. In rural Tanzania, wind power can be integrated with biochar-based agroforestry systems to create a sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural value chain. This approach not only reduces reliance on fossil fuels but also provides employment opportunities in the renewable energy sector.

### Economic Viability and Sustainability Analysis

Economic assessments have shown that biochar-based agroforestry systems paired with wind-powered irrigation can be economically viable in the long term (verify). Financial models indicate a potential return on investment within 5-7 years, making this approach an attractive option for rural communities. However, detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing this approach with conventional methods are needed to inform policy decisions.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To scale up this approach, the following policy recommendations are made:

*   **Government Support:** Provide incentives and funding opportunities for community-led biochar-based agroforestry systems paired with renewable energy sources.
*   **Research and Development:** Conduct further research on the long-term benefits of biochar-based agroforestry systems and their potential to sequester carbon in soils.
*   **Capacity Building:** Train local communities, farmers, and extension agents on the design, implementation, and maintenance of biochar-based agroforestry systems.

### Closing Outlook

The integration of biochar-based agroforestry systems with renewable energy sources like wind power offers a promising solution to water security and climate adaptation challenges in rural Tanzania. By adopting this approach, communities can enhance their resilience, promote clean energy access, and build a more sustainable future for generations to come.
