# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, exacerbating climate change impacts on agriculture and human settlements. This brief presents a comprehensive approach to addressing severe water scarcity through integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, focusing on the Ethiopian Highlands as a case study.

**Climate Change Impacts and Water Scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is characterized by high precipitation variability (annual range: 600-1400 mm), with average annual rainfall ranging from 800-1200 mm. Climate change projections indicate increased frequency and severity of droughts, further exacerbating water scarcity.

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Irrigation**

1. **Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**: Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and economically burdensome.
2. **Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**: Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration [verify].
3. **Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**: Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions, generating power with an energy efficiency of 70-80% [verify].
4. **Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**: Integrating these solutions yields cost-effective, sustainable outcomes.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

1. **Supportive Policy Environments**: Create incentives for farmers (subsidies, low-interest loans), grid integration with micro-hydro systems, and infrastructure development.
2. **Community Engagement and Capacity Building**: Engage local communities in the planning and implementation process to ensure acceptance and sustainability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Establish a monitoring and evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of these solutions.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Conduct local surveys and case studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop supportive policy environments, including incentives for farmers and grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
3. Establish a monitoring and evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of these solutions.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt offer a promising approach to addressing severe water scarcity while contributing to broader sustainable development goals in agriculture and renewable energy adoption. Further research and policy efforts are necessary to scale up these solutions and ensure their long-term sustainability.

Changes made:

* Removed speculative claims (e.g., "traditional irrigation methods... consuming 10-20 kWh/day")
* Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]"
* Preserved the title
* Tightened language throughout the brief
