# flood-resilient transport corridors in the Lower Mekong delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. We recommend immediate investments in improved water supply infrastructure, renewable energy sources, and climate-resilient agricultural practices. Specifically, we urge governments and development partners to prioritize the construction of flood-resilient transport corridors in the Lower Mekong delta, which will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions from critical sectors but also improve the livelihoods of millions in this region.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water (32.4% have access to safely managed drinking water, [Source: World Bank Open Data 2024]) and electricity (53.3% have access to electricity, [Source: World Bank Open Data 2023]), affecting health outcomes and economic development. Climate change exacerbates these challenges through increased variability in rainfall patterns, leading to more frequent droughts and floods. The region's reliance on traditional fossil fuels for electricity generation has led to high levels of greenhouse gas emissions ([Source: World Bank Open Data 2021]).

## Analysis

The renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa is only [VERIFY] % of total final energy consumption (World Bank Open Data 2020). This disparity underscores the need for transitioning towards cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy. Climate projections indicate that Sub-Saharan Africa will experience more extreme weather events such as droughts and floods, further straining water resources and exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. For instance, climate change is projected to reduce rainfall in some regions by up to [VERIFY] % (NOAA Climate Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Investment in Water Infrastructure**: Increase funding for constructing and maintaining wells, boreholes, and other surface/wellwater collection systems to improve access to safe drinking water. Implement innovative technologies such as desalination plants in coastal areas where water scarcity is severe.

2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the deployment of solar panels, wind turbines, and biogas systems to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Provide subsidies or low-interest loans for households and small businesses to install renewable energy solutions.

3. **Climate-Resilient Agriculture**: Invest in drought-resistant crop varieties, soil moisture management technologies, and irrigation systems that are climate-resilient. Implement early warning systems for weather events to help farmers prepare for adverse conditions.

4. **Community-based Water Management**: Establish community-managed water points, including the involvement of women and youth in decision-making processes. Promote awareness campaigns on hygiene practices to prevent waterborne diseases.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires coordination between multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, private sector entities, and communities. Key challenges include securing adequate funding, overcoming bureaucratic hurdles, and ensuring equitable distribution of benefits.

- **Funding**: Mobilize domestic resources through taxation or foreign aid to finance infrastructure projects.
- **Policy Support**: Develop supportive policies such as tax incentives for renewable energy investments, subsidies for water supply improvements, and regulations on waste management.
- **Community Engagement**: Engage local communities in planning and decision-making processes to ensure ownership of initiatives.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa is at a crossroads regarding its future sustainability. By focusing on improving water security, promoting clean energy access, and enhancing climate resilience, we can create a pathway toward sustainable development that benefits current and future generations. Immediate action is needed to translate policy recommendations into tangible progress.

**Call to Action**: Government officials, NGO leaders, and development practitioners should prioritize these interventions in their planning processes to mitigate the adverse impacts of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change on Sub-Saharan Africa's population.
