**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant threats to rural communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, exacerbating existing environmental challenges such as water security and clean energy access. Micro-investment platforms (MIPs) offer a promising solution by mobilizing local savings for off-grid renewable energy systems. This brief explores the potential of MIPs to strengthen climate resilience in rural communities, highlighting successful case studies and outlining key data points needed to support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

**Climate Change Vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa**

Sub-Saharan African rural communities are disproportionately affected by climate change due to their limited resources and adaptive capacity. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events threaten food security, water availability, and livelihoods. Key environmental challenges faced by these communities include:

• Water scarcity: Decreased rainfall and increased evaporation rates reduce water availability for agriculture, drinking, and sanitation.
• Soil degradation: Erosion and nutrient depletion compromise agricultural productivity and soil fertility.
• Energy insecurity: Limited access to reliable energy sources hinders economic development and increases reliance on polluting fuels.

**Micro-Investment Platforms (MIPs) for Off-Grid Renewable Energy Systems**

MIPs are structured investment platforms that allow local communities to pool their savings, leveraging collective resources to finance off-grid renewable energy systems. Successful examples of MIPs exist in other sectors, such as microfinance, demonstrating the potential for community-driven investment models.

• Definition: A MIP is a locally managed platform that aggregates individual savings to fund specific projects or initiatives.
• Structure: MIPs often involve local governance structures, ensuring community ownership and decision-making authority.
• Benefits: MIPs can increase access to clean energy, improve energy security, and stimulate economic growth in rural areas.

**Case Studies on Successful Off-Grid Renewable Energy Systems**

Several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of off-grid renewable energy systems in Sub-Saharan Africa:

• Example 1: A community-led solar energy project in Rwanda increased electricity access from 10% to 90%, reducing reliance on polluting fuels.
• Example 2: An off-grid wind energy system in Kenya powered a rural school, improving educational outcomes and serving as a model for sustainable development.

**Evidence Needed: Key Data Points**

To support the implementation of MIPs for off-grid renewable energy systems, key data points are needed:

• Socio-economic profiles of Sub-Saharan African rural populations (e.g., population size, income levels, education rates).
• Climate change impact studies specific to Sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., temperature increases, precipitation changes, extreme weather event frequency).
• Success stories from existing MIPs for renewable energy projects (e.g., project outcomes, community feedback).
• Local government policies supporting climate resilience initiatives (e.g., policy frameworks, funding allocations).

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support data collection and analysis**: Partner with local governments, NGOs, and international organizations to gather socio-economic data and climate change impact assessments.
2. **Develop community-led MIPs**: Establish locally managed platforms that aggregate individual savings for off-grid renewable energy systems.
3. **Foster partnerships and collaborations**: Engage with national ministries of environment, local NGOs, and existing MIPs to leverage resources and expertise.

**Closing Outlook**

The transition to clean cooking in peri-urban households in the Sahel region requires a comprehensive approach that addresses climate change vulnerability, water security, and clean energy access. Micro-investment platforms offer a promising solution by mobilizing local savings for off-grid renewable energy systems. By supporting data collection, developing community-led MIPs, and fostering partnerships, we can strengthen climate resilience in rural communities and support adaptation targets in NDCs.
