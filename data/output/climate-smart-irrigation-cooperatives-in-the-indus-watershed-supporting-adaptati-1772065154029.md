# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Indus watershed: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Safeguarding Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa through Integrated Approaches**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, governments, NGOs, and international organizations must prioritize integrated approaches. This policy brief recommends establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Indus watershed as a key strategy to support adaptation targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By investing in these cooperatives, decision-makers can enhance water security, increase access to clean energy, and build resilience to climate-related shocks.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with significant challenges related to water scarcity, energy poverty, and the impacts of climate change. Only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024], while 53.3% lacks reliable electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. These disparities have severe implications for public health, economic development, and environmental sustainability.

## Analysis

The current state of water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by significant disparities. For example, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024], compared to 73.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. Similarly, 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023] versus 91.6% worldwide [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following:

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Invest in climate-resilient irrigation systems and support the development of cooperatives that promote water conservation, efficient use, and renewable energy integration. This approach can enhance water security, increase access to clean energy, and build resilience to climate-related shocks.
2. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in water sanitation and hygiene programs that provide access to safe drinking water. Governments should prioritize funding for community-led water supply systems and promote the use of low-cost technologies like rainwater harvesting [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024].
3. **Enhance Renewable Energy Access**: Encourage the deployment of solar-powered energy solutions in rural areas. Governments can partner with private sector entities to develop microgrids and off-grid renewable energy systems for clinics, schools, and other critical infrastructure.
4. **Climate Resilient Infrastructure**: Implement climate-resilient water management practices such as flood control measures and drought-resistant crops in agricultural sectors [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2021]. Develop early warning systems for extreme weather events to ensure timely responses.

## Implementation Considerations

To successfully implement these recommendations, several practical steps are required:

* **Funding Mechanisms**: Establish dedicated funds or leverage existing ones (e.g., Green Climate Fund) to support water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience initiatives.
* **Capacity Building**: Train local communities and government officials in effective management of water resources and renewable energy technologies.
* **Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)**: Encourage PPPs that combine public and private sector resources to finance and implement climate-resilient infrastructure projects.

## Conclusion

By prioritizing integrated approaches that address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience, decision-makers can significantly improve living conditions for millions of people in Sub-Saharan Africa. We urge governments, NGOs, and international organizations to collaborate on implementing these recommendations at scale. Early action will be crucial in overcoming current barriers and ensuring sustainable outcomes for the region's most vulnerable populations.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and international organizations should work together to establish climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Indus watershed and support adaptation targets in NDCs. This collaborative effort can help build a more resilient future for Sub-Saharan Africa.
