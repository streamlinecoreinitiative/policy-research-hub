# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Great Lakes region: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Strengthening Community Livelihoods Through Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To stabilize food security during droughts in the Great Lakes region, we recommend implementing micro-insurance programs for smallholder farmers to mitigate drought-related risks. This policy brief outlines actionable steps to address water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water security issues, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1]. Energy access lags behind globally at 53.3%, and renewable energy consumption remains low at just 19.7%. Climate change threatens these already fragile conditions, necessitating urgent interventions in water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation strategies.

## Analysis

The lack of clean water and electricity severely impacts health, education, and economic opportunities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Children miss school due to waterborne illnesses [2]. Moreover, the region's reliance on fossil fuels for energy production contributes significantly to carbon emissions, worsening climate change effects.

## Policy Recommendations

### Enhanced Access to Safe Drinking Water
- **Increase investment in piped water supply and sanitation infrastructure**: Focus on rural areas where access is least.
- **Promote rainwater harvesting systems and community-based water management initiatives**: Utilize data from World Bank (2024) for specific regions [1].

### Promoting Clean Energy Access
- **Accelerate the roll-out of microgrids in underserved communities**: Target areas with low electricity access.
- **Implement solar-powered pumps and biogas stoves to reduce reliance on fossil fuels**: Empower local entrepreneurs through grants and subsidies (World Bank, 2023) [1].

### Climate Adaptation Measures
- **Invest in early warning systems for droughts and floods**: Utilize NOAA climate data to identify high-risk areas.
- **Support community-based adaptation projects like mangrove restoration and agroforestry value chains**: These initiatives can protect livelihoods while sequestering carbon (World Bank, 2024) [1].

## Implementation Considerations

- **Funding Mechanisms**: Leverage grants from international organizations to support these projects. Explore blended finance models for cost-sharing.
- **Community Engagement**: Engage local communities in planning and decision-making processes to ensure sustainability and ownership.
- **Capacity Building**: Train community leaders and technicians on the maintenance of water systems, renewable energy technologies, and climate change adaptation measures.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation is crucial for building a resilient future in Sub-Saharan Africa. By implementing these recommendations, decision-makers can significantly improve living conditions and foster sustainable development pathways. Next steps include scaling up successful pilot projects and advocating for increased funding from international partners.

### Background Information

**Environment**

The natural environment refers to all living and non-living things occurring naturally, along with the physical and biological factors and their chemical interactions that impact any organism or group of organisms.

**Resilience**

Resilience is the capacity to absorb and recover from disturbances in a system.
