# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Indus watershed: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Indus Watershed: Enhancing Resilience and Reducing Emissions**

### Executive Summary

This brief presents a comprehensive project proposal for addressing severe water scarcity in lower-income countries through climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, focusing on the Indus watershed. We propose integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to enhance resilience, reduce emissions, and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

### Addressing Water Scarcity in Lower-Income Countries

#### Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Indus Watershed

Climate change has significantly impacted the region, resulting in erratic rainfall patterns that exacerbate water scarcity. Agriculture is particularly vulnerable to such changes, highlighting the need for resilient irrigation methods to ensure food security and economic stability.

#### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems suffer from high water loss through evaporation and seepage, wasting precious resources and increasing the carbon footprint of agriculture. Innovative solutions are needed to address these challenges.

#### Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in enhancing climate resilience.

#### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution to energy efficiency in irrigation systems by harnessing small-scale hydroelectric power.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, improving water retention and providing a reliable source of energy for irrigation.

### Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives at scale:

* Provide subsidies to farmers who adopt integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems
* Offer low-interest loans to finance system installation and maintenance
* Invest in infrastructure development to facilitate expansion of climate-resilient water supply networks

### Future Research Directions

Additional studies are needed on:

* Long-term sustainability assessments to validate the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems
* Community engagement strategies to ensure local community participation and benefits

### Actions/Recommendations List

1. **Establish a network of climate-smart irrigation cooperatives** in the Indus watershed, integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
2. **Develop policy frameworks** that support adoption at scale, including subsidies, low-interest loans, and infrastructure development.
3. **Conduct long-term sustainability assessments** to validate effectiveness.

### Closing Outlook

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution for addressing water scarcity in lower-income countries by integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.
