**Flood-Resilient Transport Corridors in Sub-Saharan Africa: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To enhance climate resilience, improve connectivity, and align with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), we recommend that governments in Sub-Saharan Africa prioritize the development of flood-resilient transport corridors. This policy brief outlines actionable steps for decision-makers to support this critical infrastructure.

### Key Findings:

* Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024).
* Floods disrupt transportation networks, causing significant economic losses annually in Nigeria alone ([VERIFY] $1 billion in damages annually) (Source: World Bank).
* The region's limited financial resources complicate efforts to implement flood-resilient infrastructure solutions.

### Recommendations:

1. **Integrate Climate Resilience into Transportation Planning**: Develop a climate resilience framework for all transportation projects, ensuring that new or upgraded facilities are designed with flood resistance in mind.
2. **Funding Models**: Establish dedicated funding mechanisms for flood-resilient transport corridors, leveraging both public and private sector resources to ensure sustainable implementation.
3. **Community Involvement**: Engage local communities in planning and decision-making processes related to flood-resilient infrastructure projects, ensuring that solutions are culturally appropriate and community-driven.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, with over 2.2 billion people lacking access to safe water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022). Floods are a significant challenge due to their frequency and severity, disrupting critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and ports. The World Bank data shows that only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water, highlighting the urgent need for improved water security (World Bank Open Data, 2024).

In terms of energy access, while progress is being made ([VERIFY] 91.6% overall access in 2023), Sub-Saharan Africa still lags behind with only [NEEDS SOURCE] data available on electricity access.

## Analysis

Floods significantly impact transportation infrastructure, leading to frequent disruptions and hindered connectivity. For instance, in Nigeria alone, floods have caused significant economic losses annually ([VERIFY] $1 billion in damages annually) (Source: World Bank). These disruptions not only affect daily life but also impede economic growth by increasing transport costs and reducing productivity.

The lack of adequate flood resilience measures exacerbates these issues, making it crucial to integrate climate-resilient solutions into future infrastructure projects. Recent research indicates that Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable due to its geography and socio-economic conditions (IPCC).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Integrate Climate Resilience into Transportation Planning**: Develop a climate resilience framework for all transportation projects, ensuring that new or upgraded facilities are designed with flood resistance in mind.
2. **Funding Models**: Establish dedicated funding mechanisms for flood-resilient transport corridors, leveraging both public and private sector resources to ensure sustainable implementation.
3. **Community Involvement**: Engage local communities in planning and decision-making processes related to flood-resilient infrastructure projects, ensuring that solutions are culturally appropriate and community-driven.

## Implementation Considerations

- Practical Steps: Develop detailed design guidelines for flood-resistant roads, bridges, and ports; conduct feasibility studies at the regional level.
- Costs: Initial investment may range from $10 million to $50 million per project, depending on scale and complexity. However, long-term benefits in terms of reduced maintenance costs and improved infrastructure resilience are substantial.
- Potential Barriers: Limited technical expertise among local authorities and procurement challenges related to sourcing flood-resistant materials can be addressed through training programs and partnerships with international organizations.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa needs immediate attention for enhancing its climate resilience, particularly in the realm of transportation infrastructure. By implementing flood-resilient transport corridors, countries can not only improve connectivity but also better align with NDCs. Government officials, NGO leaders, and development practitioners must collaborate to develop effective funding models and ensure community engagement in these critical projects.

**Call to Action**: Governments should allocate dedicated budgets for flood-resilient infrastructure initiatives and engage stakeholders in developing comprehensive policy frameworks that prioritize climate resilience in transportation planning. NGOs can play a crucial role by providing technical assistance and capacity building, while development practitioners must advocate for these solutions at the national and international levels.
