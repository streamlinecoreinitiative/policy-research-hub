# Watershed Co-Management in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Enhancing Food Security through Indigenous Councils and Sustainable Irrigation Practices

## Executive Summary

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta faces significant challenges due to climate change-induced droughts, affecting millions of people who rely on agriculture for their livelihood. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a vital strategy for stabilizing food security in this region.

## Water Security Challenges in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions, with a significant portion of Bangladesh's population relying on agriculture. Climate change has led to increased frequency and severity of droughts, causing crop losses and economic hardship. Inefficient irrigation systems exacerbate water scarcity, resulting in substantial water loss through evaporation and seepage.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

* Existing irrigation systems are often poorly maintained and inefficient.
* Water loss through evaporation and seepage can reach up to [verify] 50% of total water usage.
* Climate change-induced droughts have led to crop losses, reduced yields, and economic hardship for farmers.

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices offer benefits for climate resilience, including:

* Improved soil health through tree roots and leaf litter
* Increased biodiversity and ecosystem services
* Enhanced carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse gas emissions
* Reduced erosion and improved water retention

### Case Studies

* A study in Bangladesh found that agroforestry systems increased crop yields by up to [verify] 30% compared to conventional farming practices.
* Another study in India demonstrated the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for efficient irrigation, including:

* Reduced reliance on diesel generators and fossil fuels
* Increased energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions
* Improved water management through real-time monitoring and control

### Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide a resilient and efficient water supply for irrigation. Pilot projects have demonstrated potential benefits, including:

* Reduced water loss through evaporation and seepage
* Improved crop yields and increased food security
* Reduced energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of watershed co-management with indigenous councils, we recommend:

* Providing subsidies and low-interest loans for agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems
* Investing in infrastructure development, including canals and water storage facilities
* Supporting community-led initiatives for climate-resilient agriculture

## Actions/Recommendations List

1. **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** to support watershed co-management with indigenous councils.
2. **Provide technical assistance and training** for farmers and communities on agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
3. **Invest in infrastructure development**, including canals, water storage facilities, and irrigation systems.
4. **Support community-led initiatives** for climate-resilient agriculture and watershed management.

## Closing Outlook

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a critical region for food security and livelihoods of millions. By integrating traditional knowledge with modern hydrological practices, communities can develop resilient irrigation systems that minimize water loss and maximize crop yields. We urge policymakers to prioritize watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a vital strategy for stabilizing food security in this region.
