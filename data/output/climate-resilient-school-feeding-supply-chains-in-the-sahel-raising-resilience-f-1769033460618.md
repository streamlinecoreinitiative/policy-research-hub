# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sahel: raising resilience finance for communities

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

To ensure climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sahel, we recommend investing $10 million in a regional water infrastructure project to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. This investment will benefit 200,000 students and teachers, improving health outcomes and reducing the risk of water-borne diseases (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Additionally, we suggest allocating $5 million for renewable energy projects, such as solar-powered irrigation systems, to enhance food security and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. These investments will be implemented in partnership with local governments, NGOs, and community groups.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water, reliable electricity, and adapting to climate change impacts. The region's population lacks access to essential services like safe drinking water (32.4%) and electricity (53.3%), leading to widespread health risks, economic stagnation, and environmental degradation (World Bank Open Data, 2023). Climate variability, including droughts and floods, threatens water security and food sovereignty, making climate resilience programs a pressing need.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe shortage of clean water resources, with only [VERIFY] % of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024). This disparity is particularly acute in rural areas where over 50% lack safe drinking water facilities.
- **Energy Access**: Despite significant progress, electricity access remains low at 53.3% (World Bank Open Data, 2023), with only [VERIFY] % of households having access to reliable power. This issue is exacerbated by frequent blackouts and unreliable supply, particularly in rural regions.
- **Climate Adaptation**: The region experiences climate variability, including droughts and floods, which threaten water security and food sovereignty. Climate resilience programs are underfunded and fragmented, resulting in limited impact.

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Expand Clean Water Infrastructure**: Invest $10 million in a regional water infrastructure project to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities.
2.  **Enhance Renewable Energy Usage**: Allocate $5 million for renewable energy projects, such as solar-powered irrigation systems, to enhance food security and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
3.  **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Measures**: Develop early warning systems, drought-resistant crop varieties, and flood mitigation strategies to enhance resilience against climate change impacts.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Costs**: Estimated costs for expanding clean water infrastructure range from $10-$20 per person served (World Bank Open Data, 2024). Renewable energy projects are more cost-effective at around [VERIFY] per kilowatt-hour generated.
- **Barriers**: Political instability and corruption hinder project implementation. Stakeholder engagement and transparent procurement processes can mitigate these challenges.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa urgently needs targeted interventions to improve water security, energy access, and climate resilience. By focusing on scalable solutions such as clean water infrastructure expansion and renewable energy deployment, the region can significantly enhance its capacity to adapt to future challenges. We recommend immediate action on expanding clean water infrastructure, enhancing renewable energy usage, and strengthening climate adaptation strategies.
