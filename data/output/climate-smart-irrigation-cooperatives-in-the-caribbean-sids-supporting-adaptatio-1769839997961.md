**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Caribbean SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing water security challenges in the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a key strategy to support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These cooperatives will enhance resilience to droughts and floods, improve crop yields, and promote sustainable water management practices.

## Context & Challenge

The Caribbean SIDS face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity. Climate change intensifies these issues through recurrent droughts and floods, threatening existing infrastructure and livelihoods. According to the World Bank (2023), only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity.

## Analysis

Recent data from the World Bank highlights stark disparities in access to safe water and electricity across the Caribbean SIDS compared to the global average. In 2024, only 73.7% of the world population had access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), whereas this figure drops to [VERIFY] for the Caribbean SIDS. Similarly, while 91.6% of the world has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data), only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population benefits from reliable power.

Renewable energy consumption in the region stands at just 19.7% of total final energy consumption globally (World Bank, 2020). These figures underscore the urgent need for climate-resilient water and energy solutions to support sustainable development and reduce vulnerability to climate impacts.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Support the formation of community-led irrigation cooperatives that adopt climate-resilient practices, such as drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage the deployment of small-scale renewable energy solutions like solar home systems, biogas digesters, and wind turbines to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
3. **Strengthen Climate Resilient Infrastructure**: Invest in climate-resilient water infrastructure that can withstand climate-induced fluctuations in rainfall and temperature.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require substantial investment, particularly in the renewable energy sector where costs are currently higher than traditional fossil fuel alternatives. However, long-term benefits include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved health outcomes from cleaner water sources, and enhanced economic stability through sustainable development practices.

Cost estimates for implementing climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives vary widely depending on location and scale. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is needed to quantify the financial implications of these interventions. While initial investments may be high, savings on healthcare costs and increased productivity will offset these expenses over time.

## Conclusion

The Caribbean SIDS' urgent need for climate-resilient water and energy solutions is clear. By prioritizing sustainable development practices, we can safeguard freshwater ecosystems and promote equitable growth across the region. Immediate action on these recommendations will not only improve living standards but also contribute to global climate goals.
