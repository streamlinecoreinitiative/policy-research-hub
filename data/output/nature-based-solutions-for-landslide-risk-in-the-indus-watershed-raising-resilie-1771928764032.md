**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Indus Watershed: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief outlines critical interventions to enhance water security, increase access to clean energy, and bolster climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the region's significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4%)[1] and electricity (53.3%)[2], it is essential to prioritize evidence-backed strategies that address both immediate needs and long-term sustainability. We recommend investing $100 million annually over three years to expand water infrastructure, enhance renewable energy deployment, and implement climate adaptation programs.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a triple challenge of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. The region's population is projected to reach 2 billion by 2050[3], putting immense pressure on already strained resources (World Bank Open Data). Water scarcity affects over [VERIFY]% of the population, with 32.4% having access to safely managed drinking water compared to a world average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data)[1]. Energy poverty is equally pressing, with only 53.3% of the population having access to electricity, significantly lower than the global average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data)[2].

## Analysis

- **Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Sub-Saharan Africa has 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water compared to a world average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data)[1]. This disparity is even more pronounced among rural populations, where only [VERIFY]% have access to safe drinking water.
- **Electricity Access**: Only 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, compared to a global average of 91.6% (World Bank Open Data)[2].
- **Renewable Energy Consumption**: Despite its potential, only [VERIFY]% of Sub-Saharan Africa's energy comes from renewable sources, falling far short of global averages (28.5%) (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1.  **Expand Water Infrastructure**:
    *   Invest $50 million annually over three years to build and upgrade water supply systems in rural areas.
    *   Prioritize communities with limited or no access to safe drinking water.
2.  **Enhance Renewable Energy Deployment**:
    *   Allocate $30 million for pilot projects in five countries, focusing on grid integration, microgrids, and off-grid solutions.
    *   Collaborate with local governments and NGOs for successful implementation.
3.  **Climate Adaptation Programs**:
    *   Implement climate-resilient water management practices and energy infrastructure.
    *   Allocate $20 million annually to support research, technology transfer, and community-based adaptation projects across five countries.

## Implementation Considerations

-   **Cost Analysis**: The total cost for the recommended interventions is approximately $100 million per year. This can be funded through a combination of domestic resources, international aid, and private sector investments.
-   **Barriers to Implementation**: Potential challenges include funding constraints, technical expertise limitations, and political will.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa urgently needs focused interventions to enhance water security, increase access to clean energy, and bolster climate resilience. By prioritizing evidence-based strategies and fostering collaboration among various stakeholders, this region can move closer to achieving its development goals while safeguarding the environment.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and international partners should commit resources and support these initiatives to ensure sustainable progress in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation for Sub-Saharan Africa.
