**Agroforestry Value Chains for Cash Crops in Pacific SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to the sustainable development of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Pacific, particularly with regards to water security and renewable energy. The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems has been identified as a promising solution for addressing these issues in lower-income countries. This brief explores the potential of agroforestry value chains for cash crops in Pacific SIDS, highlighting their ability to support adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). By leveraging the benefits of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, Pacific SIDS can enhance water security, promote renewable energy use, and contribute to broader sustainable development goals.

### I. Introduction to Water Scarcity in Pacific SIDS

Pacific SIDS face unique challenges related to climate change, including erratic rainfall patterns, sea-level rise, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. These changes have significant implications for agriculture, water security, and food systems. In the context of cash crops, water scarcity can lead to reduced yields, decreased crop quality, and increased costs for irrigation.

### II. Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been widely recognized as a climate-resilient agricultural practice that promotes soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into farming systems, agroforestry can improve water retention, reduce erosion, and increase crop yields.

### III. Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution to irrigation challenges in Pacific SIDS. By harnessing the power of small-scale hydroelectric systems, farmers can reduce their reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency.

### IV. Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects in Pacific SIDS have demonstrated the potential of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to enhance climate resilience in water supply. These initiatives have shown improved water retention, reduced erosion, and increased crop yields.

### Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Support policy development:** Encourage governments in Pacific SIDS to develop policies that support the adoption of agroforestry value chains for cash crops.
2.  **Invest in capacity building:** Provide training and technical assistance to farmers, extension agents, and other stakeholders on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  **Promote private sector engagement:** Encourage private sector investment in agroforestry value chains by providing incentives and support for sustainable agricultural practices.

### Closing Outlook

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution to water scarcity challenges in Pacific SIDS. By supporting the development of agroforestry value chains for cash crops, we can enhance climate resilience, promote renewable energy use, and contribute to broader sustainable development goals.
