**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

## Executive Summary

The Horn of Africa is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, with frequent droughts and heatwaves affecting food security and health outcomes. To mitigate these impacts, we recommend establishing climate-resilient school feeding supply chains that integrate water conservation practices, renewable energy, and climate adaptation measures. This approach can improve access to safe drinking water, enhance nutrition among children, and build community resilience against future climate-related shocks.

## Context & Challenge

The Horn of Africa faces severe water scarcity, with only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing frequency and intensity of droughts and heatwaves, further straining already limited resources. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), heat stress is a significant public health concern in the region, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children.

## Analysis

Access to safe drinking water is critical for school feeding programs, which serve over [VERIFY] 15 million children in the Horn of Africa (UNICEF). However, existing infrastructure often relies on non-renewable energy sources and lacks climate-resilient designs. Renewable energy consumption remains stagnant at [NEEDS SOURCE] 19.7% in the region, hindering sustainable development goals.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Supply Solutions**: Invest in small-scale water treatment plants and boreholes to improve access to safe drinking water. Implement community-managed water systems for cost-effective maintenance.

2. **Accelerated Renewable Energy Deployment**: Encourage solar, wind, and hydro power projects through fiscal incentives and public-private partnerships. Prioritize off-grid solutions in rural areas where grid extension is impractical.

3. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Integrate climate-resilient infrastructure designs into all new construction projects, particularly for water resources management. Develop early warning systems and community-based adaptation plans to mitigate extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

Cost estimates for small-scale water treatment plants range from $50-$100 per household (UN-Water/WHO). Solar energy systems can cost between $400 to $1,200 per household in rural areas. Potential barriers include high initial costs, lack of technical expertise, and political will to prioritize climate adaptation measures.

## Conclusion

The Horn of Africa requires immediate action on water security, clean energy, and climate resilience. By implementing cost-effective interventions and leveraging available resources, the region can achieve SDG 6 (water), accelerate renewable energy adoption, and build more resilient communities against future shocks. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and local communities is essential to ensure these efforts succeed.
