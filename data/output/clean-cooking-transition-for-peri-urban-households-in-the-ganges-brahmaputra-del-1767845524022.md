# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most populous and vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity, poverty, and environmental degradation. This brief focuses on addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in peri-urban areas through an integrated approach leveraging agroforestry and micro-hydro systems.

**Addressing Severe Water Scarcity and Poverty**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta region is characterized by:

* **Water scarcity**: Climate change impacts, population growth, and unsustainable agricultural practices exacerbate water scarcity.
* **Limited access to electricity**: Restricts the adoption of micro-hydro systems for irrigation.

Agroforestry practices can enhance soil fertility and improve water retention. Integrating agroforestry with traditional irrigation methods has shown promising results:

* **Case study 1**: A community in Guatemala implemented agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, reducing water consumption by [verify]%. 
* **Case study 2**: In Honduras, a micro-hydro system integrated with agroforestry practices increased energy production while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Efficiency and Climate Resilience**

Micro-hydro technology offers:

* **Low capital costs**: Reduces the financial burden on communities.
* **High reliability**: Ensures consistent water supply, even during droughts.
* **Integration with agroforestry**: Enhances overall system efficiency and sustainability.

Successful implementation of micro-hydro projects has been observed in various regions:

* **Case study 3**: A community in Costa Rica installed a micro-hydro system, reducing energy costs by [verify]%. 
* **Case study 4**: In Nicaragua, a micro-hydro project integrated with agroforestry practices improved water management and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems:

1. **Government policies**: Encourage investment in renewable energy infrastructure and provide incentives for communities to adopt sustainable irrigation practices.
2. **Stakeholder collaborations**: Foster partnerships between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities to implement these solutions on a larger scale.
3. **Research agenda**: Investigate the potential synergies between agroforestry and micro-hydro systems in providing climate-resilient water supply.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Conduct further research on the integration of agroforestry with traditional irrigation methods.
2. Develop policy frameworks to support the adoption of micro-hydro systems in peri-urban areas.
3. Establish partnerships between stakeholders to implement these solutions at scale.

**Closing Outlook**

The clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta requires an integrated approach addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. By leveraging agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, we can ensure sustainable economic benefits while mitigating emissions from critical sectors.
