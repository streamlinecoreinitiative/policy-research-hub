# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Caribbean SIDS: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Caribbean SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need for climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Caribbean, where climate variability and limited infrastructure exacerbate water security challenges. We recommend that governments and development partners invest in establishing and supporting these cooperatives to improve access to safe drinking water, reduce energy costs, and enhance climate resilience.

Key recommendations include:

* Establishing at least [VERIFY] new irrigation cooperatives in SIDS by 2025
* Providing targeted subsidies for renewable energy adoption and water-saving technologies
* Developing comprehensive climate adaptation plans that integrate early warning systems, water storage facilities, and resilient agricultural practices

## Context & Challenge

The Caribbean region is highly vulnerable to climate change, with rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and droughts affecting agriculture and water security. According to the World Bank (2024), only 32.4% of people in Sub-Saharan Africa have access to safely managed drinking water, a stark disparity compared to the global average [1]. This lack of access exacerbates climate vulnerability and economic stagnation.

## Analysis

The limited access to electricity in SIDS is primarily due to inadequate infrastructure and high costs. For instance, renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7% globally, but only [VERIFY] in developing regions (World Bank Open Data, 2021) [2]. This disparity not only hinders economic growth but also exacerbates climate impacts.

Climate variability further compounds these issues by increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like droughts and floods, necessitating robust adaptation strategies.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Establishing Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Governments should establish new irrigation cooperatives in SIDS, providing training on climate-resilient agriculture practices and access to renewable energy sources.
2. **Targeted Subsidies for Renewable Energy Adoption**: Development partners should provide targeted subsidies for the adoption of solar and wind energy technologies, reducing energy costs for farmers and improving water security.
3. **Comprehensive Climate Adaptation Plans**: Governments and development partners should develop comprehensive climate adaptation plans that integrate early warning systems, water storage facilities, and resilient agricultural practices.

## Implementation Considerations

Budget allocations for these interventions should come from existing development funds, including those managed by the World Bank and UN agencies. Specific costs would depend on detailed assessments of regional needs but can range widely based on scale and complexity of implementation.

## Conclusion

The Caribbean SIDS face significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water, reliable electricity, and sustainable energy sources due to climate variability and limited infrastructure development. By adopting evidence-based policy interventions supported by robust funding mechanisms, we can significantly improve living standards while enhancing regional stability and sustainability.
