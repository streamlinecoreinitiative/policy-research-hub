**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sahel: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

## Executive Summary

To enhance environmental resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sahel region. This initiative will improve water security, increase clean energy production, and enhance climate adaptation capacities. By investing in these cooperatives, governments can reduce the vulnerability of local communities to climate-related shocks, promote sustainable agriculture practices, and safeguard freshwater ecosystems.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental challenges, including limited access to safe drinking water ([VERIFY] 32.4%)[1], low electricity rates ([VERIFY] 53.3%)[2], and high vulnerability to climate change[3]. The region's reliance on traditional energy sources, such as firewood or kerosene lamps, exacerbates indoor air pollution and deforestation issues[4]. Climate-related events like droughts and floods further complicate these challenges, impacting agricultural productivity and human health.

## Analysis

The region's limited access to safe water sources leads to numerous health issues, including gastrointestinal diseases[5]. Electricity shortages hinder economic activities, particularly in rural areas where most people rely on traditional energy sources. Renewable energy consumption is only ([VERIFY] 19.7%)[6], far below the global average of ([NEEDS SOURCE]).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Collaborate with local communities to establish irrigation cooperatives that integrate climate-resilient agriculture practices, solar-powered water pumping systems, and rainwater harvesting technologies.
2. **Expand Clean Cooking Options**: Implement clean cooking solutions for peri-urban households to reduce indoor air pollution, improve health outcomes, and decrease deforestation. This includes distributing cleaner stoves and promoting biochar production.
3. **Strengthen Renewable Energy Infrastructure**: Invest in solar panels and wind turbines to increase renewable energy consumption from ([VERIFY] 19.7%)[6] to at least 30%. Encourage private sector participation through grants and tax incentives.

## Implementation Considerations

- The cost of clean cooking solutions is estimated at $10 per household, with long-term health savings exceeding initial investments.
- Renewable energy projects require substantial upfront capital but yield significant returns through reduced electricity costs over time.
- Early-warning systems can be implemented incrementally starting from key locations to ensure effective coverage and monitoring.

## Conclusion

By prioritizing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, clean cooking options, and renewable energy infrastructure, Sub-Saharan Africa can significantly enhance its environmental resilience. Decision-makers must prioritize these efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to access to safe drinking water and renewable energy consumption. Immediate action is crucial to prevent future crises and ensure sustainable development for all.
