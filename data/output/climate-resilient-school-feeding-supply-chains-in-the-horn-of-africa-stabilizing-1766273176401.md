**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Enhancing Food Security During Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Horn of Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent droughts that severely impact food security and economic stability. The school feeding program faces significant challenges due to these droughts. This brief proposes an integrated approach to enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation.

**I. Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Horn of Africa**

The region is characterized by arid and semi-arid climates, making it susceptible to climate-related shocks such as droughts. These events have severe impacts on agriculture, leading to crop failures and reduced yields. The school feeding program relies heavily on locally produced food.

**II. Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Traditional irrigation methods in the Horn of Africa include boreholes, canals, and diesel-powered pumps. These systems suffer from high water loss through evaporation and seepage, reducing their efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, the reliance on diesel generators increases energy costs and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

**III. Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry is a practice that integrates trees into agricultural landscapes, providing numerous benefits for soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Studies have shown that agroforestry systems can improve water retention, reduce erosion, and increase crop yields.

**IV. Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology involves the use of small-scale hydroelectric systems to generate electricity. These systems are energy-efficient and renewable, reducing reliance on diesel generators. When integrated with agroforestry, micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for irrigation.

**V. Integration in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains. These integrated solutions can improve food production during droughts and reduce energy costs.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Policy Support**: Governments should provide policy support for the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in school feeding supply chains.
2. **Capacity Building**: Training programs should be implemented to build the capacity of farmers, extension agents, and other stakeholders on integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Scaling Up**: Efforts should be made to scale up successful pilot projects.

**Closing Outlook**

The Horn of Africa is facing unprecedented climate-related challenges that threaten food security and economic stability. By integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into school feeding supply chains, we can enhance climate resilience and increase water security.

**Key Data Points Needed**

1. Climate data: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in the Horn of Africa (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. Economic analysis: Cost estimates and financial viability analysis for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3. Socioeconomic studies: Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.

**Summary**

This brief proposes an integrated approach to enhance climate resilience in school feeding supply chains through agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for irrigation. By leveraging the benefits of agroforestry and renewable energy, this solution can improve water security and increase food production during droughts.
