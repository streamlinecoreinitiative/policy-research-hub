**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief outlines a critical pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cooking energy in peri-urban households of the Lower Mekong Delta. The region's growing population and increasing demand for clean energy necessitate a transition away from traditional biomass fuels, which currently account for 70% of household energy consumption (World Bank, 2022). To bridge this gap, we recommend:

* Implementing a subsidy program for electric cooking appliances, targeting [VERIFY] households by 2025.
* Developing and disseminating public awareness campaigns to promote the adoption of clean cooking technologies.

## Context & Challenge

The Lower Mekong Delta is home to over [NEEDS SOURCE] people, with a significant proportion residing in peri-urban areas (World Bank, 2020). The region's rapid urbanization has led to increased energy demands, exacerbating air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from traditional biomass fuels. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to poor air quality results in an estimated [VERIFY] million premature deaths worldwide annually (WHO, 2018).

## Analysis

Cooking energy is a critical sector for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the Lower Mekong Delta. Traditional biomass fuels account for over 70% of household energy consumption, contributing significantly to regional emissions (World Bank, 2022). Electric cooking appliances offer a cleaner alternative, with an estimated reduction of up to [NEEDS SOURCE] % in particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions (IEA, 2019).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Subsidy Program for Electric Cooking Appliances**: Establish a subsidy program targeting households by 2025, providing financial incentives for the adoption of electric cooking appliances.
2. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Develop and disseminate public awareness campaigns to promote the benefits of clean cooking technologies, including improved air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require a multi-faceted approach:

* **Funding Mechanisms**: Secure funding from international development agencies, private sector investments, and public-private partnerships.
* **Capacity Building**: Train local communities in the installation and maintenance of electric cooking appliances.

## Conclusion

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cooking energy is critical for mitigating climate change impacts in the Lower Mekong Delta. By implementing a subsidy program for electric cooking appliances and developing public awareness campaigns, we can lower emissions and improve air quality for peri-urban households. We urge policymakers to prioritize this transition, ensuring a cleaner, healthier future for millions of people.

## Key Data Points to Cite

* **Household energy consumption from traditional biomass fuels (%)**: 70% (World Bank, 2022)
* **Estimated reduction in particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions with electric cooking appliances**: up to [NEEDS SOURCE] % (IEA, 2019)
* **Number of premature deaths worldwide annually due to poor air quality**: [VERIFY] million (WHO, 2018)

## Additional Evidence Needed

* Detailed cost-benefit analyses for different clean cooking technologies in the Lower Mekong Delta.
* Case studies of successful subsidy programs and public awareness campaigns promoting the adoption of electric cooking appliances.
