**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Pacific SIDS: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change is exacerbating droughts and water scarcity in lower-income countries, particularly in the Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This brief highlights the importance of environmental resilience, focusing on three critical areas: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. The case study examines peri-urban households in the Pacific SIDS, where access to reliable cooking fuel is a significant challenge during droughts. We argue that transitioning to cleaner cooking methods can stabilize food security and improve livelihoods.

**Section 1: Introduction to Climate Change Impact**

Climate change is having a profound impact on agriculture in lower-income countries, with the West African Sahel being one of the most vulnerable regions (UNDP, 2020). Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events are affecting crop yields, water availability, and livestock productivity. In the Pacific SIDS, droughts are becoming more frequent and prolonged, threatening food security and livelihoods.

**Section 2: Micro-insurance Mechanisms and Renewable Energy Solutions**

Micro-insurance can provide a critical safety net for smallholder farmers in the face of climate variability (World Bank, 2019). These mechanisms offer financial protection against crop failures, livestock losses, and other climate-related shocks. In addition to micro-insurance, renewable energy solutions such as solar-powered irrigation systems or wind energy can support farming activities by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

**Section 3: Case Studies and Economic and Social Benefits**

Several case studies from West African countries demonstrate the effectiveness of micro-insurance and renewable energy integration (OECD, 2020). For example, a study in Burkina Faso showed that farmers who participated in a micro-insurance program experienced a 25% increase in agricultural productivity compared to those without coverage. Similarly, a solar-powered irrigation system in Senegal improved crop yields by 30%. These interventions have also been shown to improve economic stability and social resilience in rural communities.

**Section 4: Challenges and Recommendations**

Implementing micro-insurance programs and renewable energy solutions can be challenging due to limited financial resources, inadequate policy frameworks, and lack of awareness among farmers (Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, Government of Burkina Faso, 2018). To overcome these challenges, policymakers should:

* Develop and implement supportive policies for micro-insurance and renewable energy programs
* Increase funding for climate-resilient agriculture initiatives
* Enhance awareness and capacity-building among farmers on the benefits of micro-insurance and clean energy

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Develop policy frameworks**: Establish supportive policies for micro-insurance and renewable energy solutions.
2. **Increase funding**: Allocate resources to climate-resilient agriculture initiatives.
3. **Enhance awareness**: Educate farmers about the benefits of micro-insurance and clean energy.

**Closing Outlook**

The Pacific SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, particularly droughts and water scarcity. Transitioning to cleaner cooking methods can stabilize food security and improve livelihoods in peri-urban households. Policymakers should prioritize environmental resilience by investing in micro-insurance mechanisms, renewable energy solutions, and policy frameworks that support these initiatives.

**Data Gaps:**

* Specific impact evaluations for micro-insurance schemes tailored to the West African Sahel context
* Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing micro-insurance with traditional financial support mechanisms
* Longitudinal studies tracking changes in farmer resilience over multiple seasons or years
