**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Horn of Africa: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

To address water insecurity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa, governments and development partners should prioritize investments in large-scale desalination plants for coastal areas, rainwater harvesting systems, and community-led initiatives for water purification and distribution. Additionally, they should increase public-private partnerships to fund renewable energy projects, implement feed-in tariffs or net metering schemes for small-scale renewable energy installations, and develop early warning systems for droughts and floods using satellite imagery and IoT sensors.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water (32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally) [1] and reliable electricity (53.3% of the population has access to electricity, compared to 91.6% worldwide) [2]. Climate change impacts such as droughts and floods exacerbate these challenges, affecting over half of Sub-Saharan African countries [3].

## Analysis

The statistics underscore the urgent need for concerted efforts in improving infrastructure and resilience strategies. For instance, only 9.2% of freshwater resources are withdrawn globally, but this percentage is lower in Sub-Saharan Africa at 4.5% [4]. Furthermore, renewable energy consumption remains low, with only 19.7% of total final energy consumed coming from renewables globally and even lower at 9.2% in Sub-Saharan Africa [5].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Security:**
   - Invest in large-scale desalination plants for coastal areas.
   - Implement rainwater harvesting systems and improve irrigation efficiency through subsidies or grants.
   - Support community-led initiatives for water purification and distribution, especially in rural regions.

2. **Promote Clean Energy Access:**
   - Increase public-private partnerships to fund renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines.
   - Implement feed-in tariffs or net metering schemes for small-scale renewable energy installations by households and businesses.

3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Measures:**
   - Develop early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events using satellite imagery and IoT sensors.
   - Provide training and equipment to farmers on agro-forestry practices that enhance soil health and reduce water stress.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these policies requires a phased approach with adequate funding, community engagement, and monitoring. Public-private partnerships can leverage resources efficiently while targeting marginalized communities through targeted subsidies or grants.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation are pressing issues that demand immediate attention from policymakers. By adopting the recommendations outlined here, governments and development partners can significantly improve living standards and contribute to global sustainability goals.
