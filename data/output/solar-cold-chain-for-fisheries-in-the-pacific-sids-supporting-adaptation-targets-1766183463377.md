# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Pacific SIDS: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS): Supporting Adaptation Targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions on Earth, facing severe water scarcity and climate change impacts. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for vulnerable communities. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution that enhances both water security and renewable energy use.

This brief explores the potential of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in Pacific SIDS, highlighting their benefits for water retention, soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Pilot projects demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and scalability of these integrated systems.

**Climate Change Impacts on Water Scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions on Earth, supporting a large population. Rising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather events pose significant threats to agricultural productivity and water security. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly.

* Climate change impacts:
	+ Rising sea levels: [verify] meters of sea level rise expected by 2050 (NOAA climate dataset)
	+ Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events
* Water scarcity consequences:
	+ Reduced agricultural productivity
	+ Decreased water availability for drinking, sanitation, and hygiene

**Agroforestry-Based Micro-Hydro Systems: A Sustainable Solution**

Agroforestry integrates trees into farming systems, promoting soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. When combined with micro-hydro technology, agroforestry can provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation.

* Benefits of agroforestry:
	+ Improved water retention
	+ Reduced erosion
	+ Increased crop yields
	+ Enhanced biodiversity

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems at scale, we recommend:

1. **Financial incentives**: Governments can provide financial incentives for farmers to adopt these integrated systems.
2. **Capacity building**: Training programs can be established to build capacity among farmers, technicians, and policymakers on agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies.

**Closing Outlook**

Pacific SIDS face significant climate change adaptation challenges. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution for enhancing water security, renewable energy use, and climate resilience. By supporting the adoption of these integrated systems, we can help vulnerable communities build their capacity to adapt to climate change impacts.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Support policy development**: Governments should develop policies and regulations that encourage the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.
2. **Invest in capacity building**: Training programs can be established to build capacity among farmers, technicians, and policymakers on agroforestry and micro-hydro technologies.

**Data Gaps**

* Long-term climate data specifically relevant to Pacific SIDS
* Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
