# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Nations**

### Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring water security, accessing clean energy, and adapting to climate change impacts. To address these interrelated issues, we recommend implementing cost-effective interventions such as solar-powered wells and rainwater harvesting ponds to improve water security and clean energy access while bolstering climate adaptation efforts.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan African countries are significantly behind the global average in terms of safe drinking water access (32.4% vs 73.7%) [1] and electricity usage (53.3% vs 91.6%) [2]. Climate change further complicates these issues, with rising temperatures and extreme weather events threatening agricultural yields and public health [3]. The region's vulnerability to climate change impacts highlights the need for robust adaptation strategies, which often include water security and clean energy solutions.

### Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the world in safe drinking water access by nearly 40 percentage points. This disparity is exacerbated by climate-related factors like droughts and floods [4].
- **Clean Energy Access**: Despite progress, only about half of Sub-Saharan African populations have access to electricity. Renewable energy consumption stands at just over one-tenth of total final energy consumption globally (19.7%) [5].
- **Climate Adaptation**: The region's vulnerability to climate change impacts underscores the need for targeted adaptation strategies that address water security and clean energy challenges.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Solar-Powered Wells for Rural Communities**: Deploy solar-powered wells in rural areas where traditional water sources are unreliable due to droughts or floods. This initiative can improve access to safe drinking water and reduce health risks associated with contaminated water.
   - **Implementation Considerations**:
     - Solar-powered well projects have proven effective, reducing costs over the long term compared to conventional solutions [6].
     - Potential barriers include initial investment costs for solar panels and infrastructure.

2. **Rainwater Harvesting Ponds**: Establish rainwater harvesting ponds in urban and peri-urban areas to augment water supplies during dry seasons. This strategy can enhance resilience by providing a reliable source of clean water, even when traditional sources are scarce.
   - **Implementation Considerations**:
     - Cost-effective compared to large-scale water treatment facilities [7].
     - Barriers include initial setup costs for ponds and potential contamination issues if not managed properly.

3. **Renewable Energy Integration**: Promote the use of solar energy in rural clinics, schools, and other community centers to provide reliable power during grid outages. This can support economic activities and improve health outcomes through better lighting and medical equipment.
   - **Implementation Considerations**:
     - Cost-effective over time as solar panels become more affordable [8].
     - Potential barriers include initial investment costs for solar panels and energy storage solutions.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Cost**: Initial investments in solar-powered wells, rainwater harvesting ponds, and renewable energy systems can be substantial but often offset by long-term savings on maintenance and operational expenses.
- **Funding**: Governments should consider leveraging international funding opportunities like grants from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) or development banks to finance these projects.

### Conclusion

Addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation requires targeted interventions that are both feasible and cost-effective. By implementing solar-powered wells, rainwater harvesting ponds, and integrating renewable energy into rural infrastructure, lower-income nations can enhance resilience and improve the well-being of their populations.

**Call to Action**: Encourage policymakers to prioritize funding for water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation projects in their national budgets and development plans. Support successful pilot programs that can serve as models for wider implementation across the region.
