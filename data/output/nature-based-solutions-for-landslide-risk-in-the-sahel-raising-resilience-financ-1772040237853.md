**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sahel: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the pressing need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of people having access to safely managed drinking water [1] and less than half (53.3%) having electricity [2], there is an urgent need for innovative solutions that can be implemented with limited resources. We recommend implementing microgrids for rural clinics, promoting renewable energy consumption, and establishing watershed co-management with indigenous councils.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. The region is home to approximately 1 billion people [3], a significant portion of whom lack access to basic utilities such as clean water and electricity (World Bank Open Data). According to UN-Water/WHO, 2.2 billion people worldwide do not have safe drinking water, with this figure being particularly acute in Sub-Saharan Africa where only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1]. Similarly, less than half (53.3%) of the region's population has access to electricity, a critical component for sustainable development [2].

Climate change exacerbates these challenges by increasing variability and unpredictability in weather patterns, leading to more frequent droughts and floods. These environmental factors not only threaten existing infrastructure but also hinder efforts towards clean energy adoption and water security improvements.

### Analysis

The current situation in Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates significant disparities in access to basic utilities and climate-resilient infrastructure. The World Bank's data highlights these stark gaps: only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to a global average of [VERIFY] 73.7% [1]. In terms of electricity access, while the world as a whole sees [VERIFY] 91.6% of its population with access, this drops to just 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa [2].

Renewable energy consumption stands at only [VERIFY] 19.7%, far below the global average and indicative of limited adoption rates [3]. These low figures underscore the need for accelerated efforts towards cleaner, more sustainable energy solutions.

### Policy Recommendations

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we propose the following actionable steps:

1. **Microgrids for Rural Clinics:**
   - Implement microgrid systems at rural health clinics to provide reliable electricity, which is essential for maintaining medical equipment and improving patient care.
   - Support local communities by engaging them in the planning and implementation phases of these projects.
   - Source data from World Bank's statistics on electrification rates in Sub-Saharan Africa [2].

2. **Promote Renewable Energy Consumption:**
   - Encourage investments in renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
   - Implement policies that incentivize the adoption of renewables, including subsidies or tax breaks for renewable projects.
   - Use data from World Bank's renewable energy consumption statistics [3].

3. **Establish Watershed Co-Management with Indigenous Councils:**
   - Collaborate with indigenous communities who have deep knowledge and traditional practices in managing natural resources.
   - Establish joint decision-making structures between government officials and local community leaders to ensure equitable and sustainable resource management.
   - Refer to data from World Bank's climate change adaptation efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa [4].

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful consideration of the specific political, economic, and social contexts within Sub-Saharan African countries. Key considerations include:

- **Funding Mechanisms:** Identify potential funding sources such as international development agencies, multilateral banks, and domestic government budgets to support project implementation.
- **Capacity Building:** Invest in training programs for local communities and government officials to build the necessary skills and knowledge needed to manage these projects effectively.

### Conclusion

The challenges faced by Sub-Saharan African countries regarding water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions. By implementing microgrids for rural clinics, promoting renewable energy consumption, and establishing watershed co-management with indigenous councils, we can begin bridging these critical gaps. This will not only enhance current living standards but also lay a foundation for more resilient future development in the region.

**Call to Action:**
Governments, NGOs, and international organizations should prioritize these recommendations as they work towards developing comprehensive strategies that promote sustainable growth and resilience within Sub-Saharan Africa. Collaboration across sectors is essential to achieving meaningful progress in addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation.
