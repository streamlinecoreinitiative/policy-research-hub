**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the region's population having access to safely managed drinking water [1] and 53.3% with electricity [2], these issues threaten immediate survival and hinder economic development (World Bank Open Data). We recommend investing in large-scale water harvesting projects, accelerating renewable energy deployment, and developing climate resilience programs to build a more resilient future for millions living in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. The region is home to 2.2 billion people lacking safe water [3], with only 32.4% having access to safely managed drinking water in 2024 [1]. Climate change exacerbates existing challenges, leading to more frequent droughts, floods, and extreme weather events that further strain already strained resources.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%) and sanitation facilities (World Bank Open Data). This disparity underscores the urgent need for sustainable water management solutions.
- **Clean Energy Access**: The region lags behind globally in electricity access, with just 53.3% of its population having access [2]. Sub-Saharan Africa is also far from meeting renewable energy consumption targets set by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6), with only 8% of total final energy consumption coming from renewables in 2021 [4].
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate change impacts are severe, including increased frequency and intensity of droughts and floods. Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to lose up to [VERIFY] % of its potential agricultural output by 2050 due to climate-related factors (IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Security Initiatives**: Implement large-scale water harvesting projects, particularly in arid regions where surface water availability is limited. Invest in desalination plants near coastal areas to provide fresh water supplies.
2. **Accelerated Renewable Energy Deployment**: Increase investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation. Focus on decentralized renewable energy solutions such as microgrids for off-grid communities, which are more resilient against climate shocks.
3. **Climate Resilience Programs**: Develop early warning systems for extreme weather events to help communities prepare and mitigate the impacts of droughts and floods. Support research into climate-resilient agricultural practices that can sustain yields under changing climatic conditions.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Analysis**: Initial costs for large-scale water harvesting projects range from $50 million to $100 million per project, while microgrids cost around $20,000 to $50,000 per community. These investments are offset by long-term savings through reduced energy bills and increased productivity.
- **Barriers**: Political instability, limited funding, and lack of technical expertise pose significant challenges in implementing these initiatives. Addressing these barriers requires coordinated efforts from governments, international donors, and local communities.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to ensure sustainable development. By adopting evidence-based policies and innovative solutions, the region can build a more resilient future for its people. We urge policymakers, NGOs, and development practitioners to prioritize these critical areas in their work.

**Key Data Points:**
