**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

**Executive Summary**
This policy brief highlights the critical need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), and just [VERIFY]53.3% accessing electricity (World Bank, 2023), these issues are not only dire but also exacerbate poverty, health risks, and economic instability. This brief outlines actionable recommendations that address these challenges while considering the political, institutional, and financial constraints of Sub-Saharan African governments and development partners.

**Context & Challenge**
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to [VERIFY]1.2 billion people (UN Population Data, 2024), yet only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024). In contrast, just 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africans have access to electricity (World Bank, 2023). These statistics underscore a significant gap in basic human needs and infrastructure development.

Climate change poses additional challenges, with droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events becoming more frequent (NOAA Climate Data, 2024). This exacerbates water scarcity issues and affects agricultural productivity. Without robust adaptation measures, Sub-Saharan Africa is at risk of further deterioration in these critical areas, impacting health outcomes, economic growth, and social stability.

**Analysis**
Sub-Saharan Africa's challenges are exacerbated by limited access to clean energy sources. Only [VERIFY]53.3% of the population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), with significant disparities across regions and income levels. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, only [NEEDS SOURCE]% of rural households have access to electricity compared to [NEEDS SOURCE]% for urban areas. This disparity not only affects daily living conditions but also hinders economic development and social progress.

Renewable energy consumption remains low at just 19.7% of total final energy consumption in the world (World Bank, 2020), with Sub-Saharan Africa contributing significantly to this gap. The region's reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation is a major hurdle, as it contributes to higher greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

Climate change impacts are also evident, with Sub-Saharan Africa experiencing more frequent droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events (NOAA Climate Data, 2024). This not only disrupts agricultural productivity but also exacerbates water scarcity issues. For instance, in Kenya, an estimated [NEEDS SOURCE]% of the population relies on rainfall for their water needs (Kenya Water & Sanitation Council, 2023), making it vulnerable to drought-induced shortages.

**Policy Recommendations**

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water:**
   - Implement large-scale infrastructure projects such as boreholes and pipelines in rural areas where access is limited.
   - Promote water harvesting techniques like rainwater collection systems for urban settings (World Bank, 2024).
   - Encourage private sector investment through public-private partnerships (PPP) to finance and maintain water supply facilities.

2. **Enhance Renewable Energy Consumption:**
   - Invest in renewable energy projects such as solar power plants, wind farms, and hydroelectric dams.
   - Develop supportive policies like feed-in tariffs and tax incentives for renewable energy producers.
   - Support grid modernization efforts to integrate more renewables into the existing electricity system.

3. **Strengthen Climate Adaptation Measures:**
   - Implement early warning systems and climate change impact assessments in vulnerable regions.
   - Invest in resilient infrastructure such as flood barriers, sea walls, and drought-resistant crops for agriculture.
   - Promote community-based adaptation initiatives that empower local communities to adapt to changing conditions.

**Implementation Considerations**

- **Cost Implications:** The initial investment costs for large-scale water supply projects can be substantial. However, long-term benefits include reduced healthcare costs and improved economic productivity (World Bank, 2024).
- **Political Will:** Securing political commitment from governments is crucial to ensure sustained funding and policy support.
- **Technical Expertise:** Skilled workforce and technical knowledge are needed for project design, implementation, and maintenance.

**Conclusion**
Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience. By focusing on increasing safe drinking water access, enhancing renewable energy consumption, and strengthening adaptation measures, governments and development partners can significantly improve the well-being of their populations while fostering sustainable economic growth. We urge immediate action to implement these recommendations, recognizing that incremental progress is essential for long-term success.

- Call to Action: Governments should prioritize funding and policy initiatives aimed at addressing water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- Next Steps: Develop specific implementation plans with clear timelines and resource allocation strategies.
