**Harnessing Biomass Energy for Sustainable Agriculture in the East African Highlands: Strengthening Climate Resilience**

**Executive Summary**

The East African Highlands are facing significant challenges due to climate change, which is impacting agriculture and threatening the livelihoods of farmers. Biomass energy offers a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional fossil fuels, enabling farmers to maintain their livelihoods during droughts or extreme weather events. This brief highlights the benefits of biomass energy for agriculture in the East African Highlands, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased farm productivity. It also identifies challenges and proposes solutions for widespread adoption, as well as policy recommendations for promoting biomass energy in agriculture.

**Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in the East African Highlands**

The East African Highlands are one of the most productive agricultural regions globally, but climate change is posing significant threats to this sector. Unpredictable rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, and increased frequency of extreme weather events are impacting crop yields, reducing farm productivity, and affecting farmers' livelihoods. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), climate change adaptation in agriculture is essential for ensuring food security and promoting sustainable development.

**Benefits of Biomass Energy for Agriculture**

Biomass energy offers several benefits for agriculture in the East African Highlands. It can be used to power agricultural machinery, irrigation systems, and other farm equipment, reducing dependence on traditional fossil fuels. Biomass energy also has lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels, contributing to climate change mitigation efforts. Additionally, biomass energy can provide a stable source of income for farmers, particularly during droughts or extreme weather events when crop yields are reduced.

**Challenges and Solutions for Adoption**

Despite the benefits of biomass energy, several challenges need to be addressed to facilitate widespread adoption in the East African Highlands. These include:

* High upfront costs associated with investing in biomass energy technologies
* Limited access to technology and expertise among farmers
* Government policies and regulations that may not support biomass energy development

To address these challenges, governments, international organizations, and local communities can work together to provide support for biomass energy adoption. This includes:

* Providing incentives for farmers to invest in biomass energy technologies
* Developing capacity-building programs for farmers and agricultural extension services
* Encouraging policy reforms that promote biomass energy development

**Policy Recommendations for Promoting Biomass Energy in Agriculture**

To promote biomass energy in agriculture, the following policy recommendations are proposed:

1. **Develop and implement policies that support biomass energy development**, including tax incentives, subsidies, and grants for farmers investing in biomass energy technologies.
2. **Establish a national biomass energy strategy** to guide investments and policy decisions related to biomass energy development.
3. **Provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs** for farmers, agricultural extension services, and other stakeholders involved in biomass energy development.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Governments should develop policies that support biomass energy development and provide incentives for farmers to invest in biomass energy technologies.
2. International organizations should provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for farmers and agricultural extension services.
3. Local communities should mobilize resources and expertise to support biomass energy adoption.

**Closing Outlook**

Harnessing biomass energy for sustainable agriculture in the East African Highlands offers a promising solution for strengthening climate resilience. By addressing challenges and promoting biomass energy development, governments, international organizations, and local communities can work together to ensure that farmers have access to stable sources of income and energy, even during droughts or extreme weather events.
