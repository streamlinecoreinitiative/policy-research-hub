# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Central America dry corridor: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Micro-insurance for Smallholder Drought Risk in the Central America Dry Corridor: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issue of drought risk in smallholder agriculture, we recommend implementing micro-insurance programs specifically designed for farmers in the Central America dry corridor. This initiative aims to protect livelihoods and promote climate resilience among vulnerable communities. By investing in micro-insurance, governments and development partners can help reduce the economic and social impacts of droughts, ultimately contributing to food security and sustainable development.

Key findings:

* 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacks access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024].
* Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa stands at 9.1% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020].
* The region has a significant potential for renewable energy growth, with only 53.3% of the population accessing electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023].

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan African countries face severe challenges in ensuring access to clean water, electricity, and sustainable energy sources. Limited resources exacerbate these issues. As global temperatures rise, extreme weather events will become more frequent and intense, further straining existing infrastructure.

Recent data highlights the urgency of addressing these challenges:

* 2.2 billion people worldwide lack safe drinking water [Source: UN-Water/WHO, 2022].
* Sub-Saharan Africa has made significant progress in increasing access to electricity, but still lags behind other regions [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023].

## Analysis

Despite progress in increasing access to basic services, Sub-Saharan Africa continues to face critical gaps:

* The region's population lacking safely managed drinking water stands at 32.4% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024].
* Renewable energy consumption remains low at 9.1% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020].

Climate change impacts are already being felt:

* Rising temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns threaten existing water resources, making it challenging to meet growing demand for clean water.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following policies:

1. **Enhance Water Management Systems**: Develop comprehensive national water management plans to improve access to safe drinking water. Invest in infrastructure such as wells, pipelines, and treatment facilities.

2. **Increase Renewable Energy Investments**: Expand renewable energy projects like solar farms and wind turbines to increase the share of clean energy consumption to at least 15% by 2030. Implement policies that incentivize private sector investment in renewable energy.

3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods, implement climate-resilient infrastructure projects, and provide insurance schemes to protect vulnerable communities from natural disasters.

## Implementation Considerations

To overcome potential barriers, such as limited financial resources and political instability:

* Establish regional water management committees to facilitate coordination and decision-making.
* Allocate dedicated funding from national budgets to support water management and renewable energy initiatives.
* Engage local communities in decision-making processes to ensure ownership and sustainability.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan African nations must prioritize water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to build resilient communities. By implementing evidence-based policies and practical solutions, these countries can secure a sustainable future for their populations. Collaboration among governments, NGOs, and the private sector is essential in overcoming financial and institutional constraints.
