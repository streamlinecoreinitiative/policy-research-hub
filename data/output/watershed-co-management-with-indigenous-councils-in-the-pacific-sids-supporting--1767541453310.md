# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Pacific SIDS: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils: Supporting Adaptation Targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)**

**Executive Summary**

The Pacific SIDS are vulnerable to climate change impacts, including sea-level rise and increased frequency of extreme weather events. This brief outlines a comprehensive plan for watershed co-management with indigenous councils to support adaptation targets in NDCs. The proposed solution aims to improve the resilience of communities by integrating traditional knowledge with modern technologies.

**Environmental Resilience through Watershed Co-management**

### Introduction to Climate Change Impacts

Climate change is affecting Pacific SIDS by causing sea-level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. This poses significant challenges for small island communities.

### Current Water Management Practices and Challenges

Traditional water management practices in Pacific SIDS often rely on rainwater harvesting and community-based irrigation systems. However, these methods are often inefficient and unsustainable due to:

* [Verify] 30% loss of water through evaporation and seepage
* High costs associated with manual labor and fuel for diesel generators

### Indigenous Knowledge and Traditional Practices in Watershed Co-management

Indigenous councils play a crucial role in watershed co-management, providing traditional knowledge on sustainable water management practices. Successful projects demonstrate improved water retention capacity:

* [Verify] 15% increase in water retention
* Reduced erosion through natural barriers and vegetation restoration

Indigenous knowledge also provides insights into natural pest control and pollination services, reducing the need for chemical inputs.

### Modern Technologies for Watershed Co-management

Modern technologies, such as rainwater harvesting systems and solar-powered irrigation pumps, offer efficient and sustainable solutions for water management. Successful projects demonstrate improved irrigation efficiency:

* [Verify] 20% reduction in diesel generator usage
* Improved crop yields through increased water availability

### Integration of Traditional Knowledge with Modern Technologies in Watershed Co-management**

Pilot projects integrating traditional knowledge with modern technologies demonstrate improved water security through increased crop yields and reduced dependency on external energy sources.

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Capacity Building:** Provide training and capacity-building programs for indigenous councils to enhance their role in watershed co-management:
	* [Verify] 50% increase in community engagement
2. **Infrastructure Development:** Fund infrastructure improvements needed to facilitate the implementation of these solutions:
	* Develop community-based irrigation systems with local government support
3. **Long-term Sustainability Assessments:** Conduct studies on long-term impacts to ensure sustainability:
	* 5-year monitoring period for water retention, erosion control, and community engagement

**Closing Outlook**

This project proposal demonstrates a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change impacts in Pacific SIDS by integrating traditional knowledge with modern technologies. By supporting adaptation targets in NDCs, this initiative promotes environmental resilience and sustainable development in vulnerable communities.
