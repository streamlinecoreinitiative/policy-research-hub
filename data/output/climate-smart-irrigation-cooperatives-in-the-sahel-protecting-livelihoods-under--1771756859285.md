# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sahel: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sahel: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

To address the triple challenge of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend implementing policies that improve water security through sustainable irrigation systems, renewable energy integration for clean cooking, and climate adaptation measures like early warning systems. Specifically, governments should invest in climate-smart irrigation cooperatives that promote efficient water use, rainwater harvesting, and community-based adaptation plans.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is severely lagging behind in meeting basic needs such as safe drinking water (32.4%) [1] and electricity access (53.3%) [2], according to World Bank data. Climate change intensifies these challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and floods that strain already limited resources [3].

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only 32.4% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 73.7% globally [1]. This disparity is exacerbated by climate change, which affects water availability and quality.

### Clean Energy Access

Sub-Saharan Africa lags significantly in electricity access (53.3%), with only 91.6% of the global population having access to electricity [2]. Renewable energy consumption in the region is relatively low at 19.7% [4].

### Climate Adaptation

Limited data are available on climate adaptation progress, but it is expected to be a critical area needing support.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Sustainable Irrigation Systems**: Governments should invest in climate-smart irrigation systems that promote efficient water use and rainwater harvesting.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Integration for Clean Cooking**: Develop decentralized renewable energy projects, such as solar-powered mini-grids for off-grid areas, to increase access to clean cooking fuels like biogas digesters and improved cookstoves.
3. **Implement Early Warning Systems**: Establish early warning systems for droughts, floods, and other climate-related events to enhance community-based adaptation plans focusing on food security and water management.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimated costs range from $10 to $20 billion annually for comprehensive water security measures [5]. However, this number is not verified in the research data provided. Renewable energy projects can be funded through grants and low-interest loans. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private sectors is crucial to overcome limited financial resources, lack of skilled labor, and political will.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address its water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability by implementing comprehensive policies that improve access to safe drinking water, promote clean energy, and enhance climate resilience. By investing in climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, governments can build a more sustainable and resilient future for their citizens.
