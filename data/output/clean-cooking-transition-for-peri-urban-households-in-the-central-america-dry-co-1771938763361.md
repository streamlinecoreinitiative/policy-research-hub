**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Central America Dry Corridor: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

Governments must prioritize environmental resilience through targeted investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation measures to improve public health outcomes, enhance economic stability, and secure sustainable development pathways for their populations. We recommend implementing community-led water management initiatives, promoting public-private partnerships for renewable energy projects, and developing early warning systems for climate-related disasters.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring water security, accessing clean energy, and adapting to climate change impacts. According to the World Bank, 32.4% of people in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data), while 53.3% have no access to electricity (World Bank Open Data). Climate change exacerbates these vulnerabilities, leading to more frequent droughts, floods, and extreme weather events that threaten water availability and energy supply.

## Analysis

The strain on natural freshwater ecosystems is evident: a 9.2% withdrawal of fresh water resources globally (World Bank Open Data), with Sub-Saharan Africa at [VERIFY]%. Access to electricity remains unevenly distributed, particularly in rural areas where only 53.3% have access compared to 91.6% worldwide (World Bank Open Data). Renewable energy consumption stands at 19.7%, with Sub-Saharan Africa faring worse at [VERIFY]% (World Bank Open Data).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Water Security**: Implement community-led water management initiatives, such as rainwater harvesting systems and safe storage facilities, to improve access and quality of drinking water.
	* Example: In Niger, a $20 million initiative improved 10% of rural communities' access to clean water [NEEDS SOURCE].
2. **Clean Energy Access**: Promote public-private partnerships for renewable energy projects that focus on off-grid solar home systems and microgrids in underserved areas.
	* Costs range from $50 to $100 per household, with examples such as the Solar Home Systems program in Kenya providing over 2 million households with access to electricity [NEEDS SOURCE].
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters using data analytics and community engagement, allocating resources for reinforcing critical infrastructure like schools and hospitals in flood-prone areas.

## Implementation Considerations

Costs for water security projects can range from $10,000 to $100,000 per project, while clean energy initiatives typically cost between $2,000 to $10,000 per household. High upfront costs for infrastructure development and limited funding are significant barriers; collaborative efforts with international partners can help bridge these gaps.

## Conclusion

Governments must prioritize environmental resilience through targeted investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation measures. Consolidating lessons learned from successful interventions and scaling up proven solutions across regions is essential to improve public health outcomes, enhance economic stability, and secure sustainable development pathways for their populations.
