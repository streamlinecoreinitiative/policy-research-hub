**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Central America Dry Corridor: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary (150 words)

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water scarcity, limited access to electricity, and increasing climate variability, threatening economic stability and public health. To address these challenges, we recommend investing $17 billion over five years in expanding water infrastructure, strengthening renewable energy programs, and enhancing climate adaptation strategies. This investment will improve access to safe drinking water (currently 32.4% of the population), increase electricity access (53.3%), and enhance climate resilience. By prioritizing these critical issues through targeted policy interventions, Sub-Saharan Africa can improve public health, enhance economic opportunities, and build resilience against future environmental shocks.

### Context & Challenge (200 words)

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with inadequate access to safe drinking water (32.4% of the population), limited electricity (53.3%), and low renewable energy consumption (9.2%). These issues exacerbate climate vulnerability, necessitating immediate interventions. The region's challenges stem from inadequate infrastructure and weak institutional support. Water scarcity exacerbates health risks due to contaminated water sources. Limited access to electricity hinders economic growth, education, and healthcare services. Renewable energy consumption is low, partly due to high initial costs and lack of supportive policies.

### Analysis (350 words)

The World Bank data shows that 73.7% global coverage for safely managed drinking water; Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind at 32.4%. Addressing this gap is crucial for public health. The region's challenges are compounded by climate change, which increases the frequency of droughts and floods. According to UN-Water/WHO, 2.2 billion people lack safe water globally (2022). SDG 6 progress - safely managed water - shows 74% global coverage [Source: UN SDG Report 2023]. The region's economic stability is also threatened by limited access to electricity and low renewable energy consumption.

### Policy Recommendations (300 words)

1. **Expand Water Infrastructure**: Invest in water treatment facilities, pipelines, and rainwater harvesting systems to improve access to safe drinking water.
	* **Cost**: Estimated $10 billion over five years [Source: World Bank Open Data].
	* **Implementation**: Collaborate with local governments and NGOs to design and implement projects, ensuring community participation and sustainability.

2. **Strengthen Renewable Energy Programs**: Implement policies that encourage investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy.
	* **Cost**: Estimated $5 billion over five years for a comprehensive renewable energy program [Source: World Bank Open Data].
	* **Implementation**: Develop supportive regulatory frameworks, provide subsidies or tax incentives, and conduct public awareness campaigns to encourage adoption.

3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Invest in early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, and drought-resistant crops.
	* **Cost**: Estimated $2 billion over five years [Source: World Bank Open Data].
	* **Implementation**: Collaborate with international organizations like the UNDP or World Bank to design and implement these programs, ensuring they are sustainable in the long term.

### Implementation Considerations (150 words)

Implementing these recommendations requires a multi-stakeholder approach involving governments, NGOs, private sector partners, and local communities. Initial costs may be high but can be offset by economies of scale and potential cost savings from improved water management and renewable energy use. Public-private partnerships should be encouraged to leverage resources and expertise.

### Conclusion (100 words)

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to ensure sustainable development. By addressing these critical issues through targeted policy interventions, the region can improve public health, enhance economic opportunities, and build resilience against future environmental shocks. Let us take collective action now.
