**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing issue of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend implementing solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries in the Sudano-Sahelian belt. This intervention can significantly reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups by providing a reliable source of cold storage for fish, thereby reducing post-harvest losses and improving food security.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in ensuring access to safe drinking water (32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1]) and reliable electricity (17% of total final energy consumption comes from renewables [2]). The region is home to nearly 1 billion people, with many lacking basic necessities like clean water and energy. These factors contribute significantly to health issues, economic instability, and poverty.

## Analysis

The limited access to clean water exacerbates existing health risks in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to UN-Water/WHO, 2.2 billion people globally do not have access to safe water [3], with a majority concentrated in developing regions like Sub-Saharan Africa (32.4% of the population lacks access to safely managed drinking water) [1]. This figure underscores the urgent need for robust interventions that can improve water security and mitigate related health risks.

In terms of energy, renewable sources are underutilized compared to the global average. The World Bank data indicates that only 17% of total final energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa comes from renewables [2], leaving a significant gap between current levels and international commitments like those outlined in the Paris Agreement.

## Policy Recommendations

To address water security and clean energy challenges, we recommend:

1. **Expand Solar-Powered Cold-Chain Systems for Fisheries**: Implement solar-powered cold-chain systems in fisheries across the Sudano-Sahelian belt to reduce post-harvest losses and improve food security.
2. **Enhance Rainwater Harvesting Initiatives**: Invest in rainwater harvesting ponds and other storage facilities to capture and store rainfall during wet seasons, ensuring a consistent supply of clean water even during dry periods.
3. **Promote Community-Based Watershed Management**: Establish community-led watershed management programs that involve local residents in conservation efforts aimed at preserving natural resources and preventing soil erosion.

## Implementation Considerations

To successfully implement these recommendations:

- Secure dedicated funding sources through grants, concessional loans, or innovative financing mechanisms like blended finance models.
- Provide technical assistance to communities to ensure the effective operation and maintenance of new systems.
- Train local leaders in water management techniques and renewable energy technologies to build sustainable governance structures.

## Conclusion

Fostering climate resilience through comprehensive strategies for water security, clean energy, and adaptation is essential for Sub-Saharan Africa's future. By expanding solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries, enhancing rainwater harvesting initiatives, and promoting community-based watershed management, decision-makers can significantly improve the lives of millions while contributing to broader development goals.
