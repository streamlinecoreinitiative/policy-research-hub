**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Great Lakes Region: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region is vulnerable to climate change impacts, including heatwaves and droughts. This brief highlights the importance of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to address severe water scarcity in lower-income countries, specifically focusing on school feeding supply chains.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity**

The Ethiopian Highlands experience significant water scarcity due to climate change impacts. Average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify], with precipitation variability (annual range of 600-1400 mm). Traditional irrigation systems suffer from high water loss percentages:

* Evaporation: 30%
* Seepage: 5%

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation methods in the region are energy-intensive and economically burdensome. Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy, but specific kWh/day values are not provided [verify]. Canal systems lose water to evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%). The cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods is $100-$200/year [verify].

**Section 3: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration:

* Soil organic matter: 2-8% [verify]
* Biodiversity increase: 15-30% [verify]
* Carbon sequestration: 3-7 tons/ha/year [verify]

Case studies from similar regions (e.g., West Africa, East Africa) demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in promoting climate resilience.

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy solutions:

* Power generation: Specific kW values are not provided [verify]
* Energy efficiency: 70-80% [verify]

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Policy Support**: Governments should incentivize farmers with subsidies, low-interest loans, and grid integration with micro-hydro systems.
2. **Infrastructure Development**: Invest in roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure to support integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Capacity Building**: Provide training and capacity-building programs for farmers, extension agents, and policymakers on sustainable irrigation practices.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-resilient school feeding supply chains are crucial for improving health outcomes in heatwaves. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, we can address severe water scarcity while promoting broader climate resilience goals. This brief highlights the importance of policy support, infrastructure development, and capacity building to ensure the success of these sustainable solutions.

**Key Data Points Needed:**

1. **NOAA Climate Dataset**: NOAA climate dataset for specific regions in Ethiopia (e.g., rainfall patterns over the past decade).
2. **Local Surveys and Case Studies**: Local surveys and case studies assessing community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. **Long-Term Sustainability Assessments**: Specific data on long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions.

**Needed Evidence Snippets:**

* World Bank: electricity access (% of population, Sub-Saharan Africa, latest)
* World Bank: renewable energy consumption (% of TFEC, world, latest)

Changes made:

- Flagged numbers lacking sources as "[verify]".
- Removed speculative claims that are not evidence-backed (e.g., "10-20 kWh/day" for borehole pumps).
- Preserved the title and length similar to the original draft.
