# mangrove restoration and blue carbon finance in the Caribbean SIDS: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Caribbean SIDS: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face a pressing challenge in protecting their livelihoods from climate stress, particularly in terms of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1], and 53.3% without access to electricity [2], these islands are highly vulnerable to climate-related shocks. To address this challenge, we recommend that governments and development partners prioritize community-based mangrove restoration projects, coupled with blue carbon finance initiatives.

## Context & Challenge

The Caribbean SIDS are among the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change impacts, including sea-level rise, increased storm frequency, and droughts [3]. The region's unique geography, with extensive coastlines and coral reefs, makes it particularly susceptible to climate-related disasters. Moreover, the islands' small size and limited resources exacerbate their vulnerability.

## Analysis

The lack of access to safe drinking water and electricity in the Caribbean SIDS is a pressing concern. According to World Bank data [1], 32.4% of the population lacks access to safely managed drinking water, while 53.3% are without access to electricity [2]. These numbers are even more alarming when compared to global averages: 73.7% of the world's population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], and 91.6% have access to electricity [2].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend the following policy actions:

*   **Community-based Mangrove Restoration**: Develop and implement community-led mangrove restoration projects that not only protect coastal ecosystems but also provide livelihood opportunities for local communities.
*   **Blue Carbon Finance**: Establish blue carbon finance mechanisms to support the scaling up of mangrove restoration efforts. This can be achieved through partnerships with international organizations, NGOs, and private sector companies.
*   **Climate Adaptation Strategies**: Implement early warning systems, improve infrastructure resilience against climate impacts, and enhance disaster preparedness through training and community engagement.

## Implementation Considerations

To ensure the successful implementation of these policy recommendations:

1.  **Develop detailed plans** for water management projects, including cost estimates based on local conditions.
2.  **Identify potential partners**, such as NGOs, private sector companies, and international organizations.
3.  **Estimate total investment costs**, factoring in both initial capital costs and ongoing maintenance expenses.

## Conclusion

The Caribbean SIDS face a pressing challenge in protecting their livelihoods from climate stress. To address this challenge, we recommend prioritizing community-based mangrove restoration projects, coupled with blue carbon finance initiatives. By taking swift action now, governments and development partners can build resilient communities capable of thriving despite changing environmental conditions.
