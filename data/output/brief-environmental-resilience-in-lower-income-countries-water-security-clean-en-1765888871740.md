# Brief: Environmental resilience in lower-income countries: water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation\n\n**Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Policy Brief**

**Executive Summary**

This policy brief focuses on environmental resilience in lower-income countries, highlighting the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. The brief emphasizes the importance of addressing these issues through targeted interventions, robust policy frameworks, and community engagement. It also underscores the need for adequate financing to support environmental resilience initiatives.

**Section 1: Water Security Challenges**

Water scarcity is a critical issue in lower-income countries, affecting millions of people worldwide. Understanding the severity of this problem is essential for developing effective solutions. Key data points needed include:

* Percentage of population lacking access to safe drinking water (UN-Water GLAAS)
* Annual rainfall variability and drought frequency (World Bank Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Performance Database)

Sources to consult for this section include:

* UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water (GLAAS)
* World Bank Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Performance Database

**Section 2: Clean Energy Solutions for Lower-Income Countries**

Access to clean energy is essential for reducing carbon footprints and improving livelihoods. Key data points needed include:

* Proportion of population with access to electricity (International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Statistics Database)
* Costs and availability of renewable energy technologies (e.g., solar, wind) (OECD Environment Statistics)

Sources to consult for this section include:

* International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Statistics Database
* OECD Environment Statistics

**Section 3: Climate Adaptation Strategies in Lower-Income Countries**

Effective climate adaptation strategies are critical for mitigating the impacts of climate change. Key data points needed include:

* Frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts) (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Reports)
* Vulnerability indices based on climate exposure and adaptive capacity (World Bank Adaptation Gap Report)

Sources to consult for this section include:

* Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Reports
* World Bank Adaptation Gap Report

**Section 4: Financing Environmental Resilience Initiatives in Lower-Income Countries**

Adequate financing is crucial for implementing environmental resilience projects. Key data points needed include:

* Total public and private investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation (OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Database on Official Development Assistance (ODA))
* Funding gaps identified by local governments and international organizations (World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal)

Sources to consult for this section include:

* OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Database on Official Development Assistance (ODA)
* World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal

**Section 5: Policy and Regulatory Frameworks for Environmental Resilience**

Robust policy frameworks are necessary to guide sustainable development. Key data points needed include:

* Number of environmental laws in place (UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Global Environmental Outlook Reports)
* Compliance rates with environmental regulations (OECD Reviews of National Environmental Policy)

Sources to consult for this section include:

* UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Global Environmental Outlook Reports
* OECD Reviews of National Environmental Policy

**Section 6: Community Engagement and Capacity Building for Environmental Resilience**

Involving communities in decision-making processes enhances resilience. Key data points needed include:

* Percentage of community participation in environmental planning and implementation (World Bank Community Participation in Development Projects Report)
* Training needs and resources available for local stakeholders (UNDP Human Development Reports)

Sources to consult for this section include:

* World Bank Community Participation in Development Projects Report
* UNDP Human Development Reports

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Conduct targeted research**: Identify specific data gaps (e.g., regional variations, historical climate trends) that require additional research.
2. **Develop tailored interventions**: Recommend targeted interventions based on identified needs and available resources.
3. **Enhance policy frameworks**: Strengthen policy frameworks to guide sustainable development and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.
4. **Increase community engagement**: Involve communities in decision-making processes to enhance resilience.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience is a pressing concern for lower-income countries, requiring immediate attention from policymakers, international organizations, and local stakeholders. By addressing water security challenges, promoting clean energy solutions, implementing climate adaptation strategies, securing adequate financing, and strengthening policy frameworks, we can build more resilient communities and promote sustainable development.
