# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sahel: stabilizing food security during droughts

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Sahel: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts**

### Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa's water security and energy access challenges are exacerbated by climate change, with only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1] and 53.3% accessing electricity (World Bank, 2023) [2]. To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing community-led infrastructure projects, renewable energy investments, and climate adaptation measures.

### Context & Challenge

Despite significant progress in global water coverage (74% safely managed water sources), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in meeting basic water security needs. Climate change is further threatening existing infrastructure, with rising temperatures, more frequent droughts, and extreme weather events exacerbating the challenges. The region's limited access to safe water and electricity hampers economic development and increases vulnerabilities.

### Analysis

The available data highlights the need for efficient management practices: less than 10% of fresh water resources are being withdrawn (World Bank, 2021) [3]. Renewable energy statistics also indicate a significant gap in adoption and integration, with only 19.7% of global consumption coming from renewables (World Bank, 2020), Sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind other regions.

### Policy Recommendations

To address the challenges outlined above, we recommend:

* **Water Security**: Implement community-led water point projects to improve access to safe drinking water.
* **Clean Energy**: Invest in solar-powered mini-grids for rural electrification. With an estimated cost of $20 million per year for 10 years (World Bank estimate), this investment will not only improve energy access but also create jobs and stimulate local economies.
* **Climate Adaptation**: Promote climate-resilient agricultural practices, including drought-resistant crops and improved irrigation systems.

### Implementation Considerations

While these recommendations are feasible, there may be challenges in implementation:

* Limited local expertise in renewable energy installation and community buy-in may pose challenges.
* Conducting training programs for local communities and providing financial incentives can address some of these issues.
* Engaging communities early in project design is crucial to ensure that projects meet their needs.

### Conclusion

The urgent need for investment in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot be overstated. We call on governments and international partners to commit resources for immediate interventions to enhance resilience against climate shocks.
