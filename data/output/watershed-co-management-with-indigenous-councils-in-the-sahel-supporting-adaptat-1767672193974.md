# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to water security and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, particularly in the Sahel region due to its arid climate and increasing population pressure. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a strategy for supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

## I. Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sahel

The Sahel region is characterized by limited rainfall and increasing temperatures, leading to severe water scarcity. Agriculture is heavily impacted by erratic rainfall patterns and changing climate conditions.

## II. Current Water Management Practices and Challenges

Traditional water management practices in the Sahel include boreholes, canals, and communal wells. However, these systems often suffer from high evaporation rates, seepage losses, and limited scalability (Source: [World Bank, 2019]).

## III. Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils

Indigenous councils in the Sahel possess traditional knowledge on watershed management, including agroforestry practices that enhance soil health and biodiversity (Source: [ICRAF, 2018]). By integrating this knowledge with modern technologies such as micro-hydro systems, communities can develop more efficient water management systems. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of integrated watershed co-management in improving water retention and reducing erosion.

## IV. Policy Recommendations

To support adaptation targets outlined in NDCs, policymakers should:

*   **Promote Integrated Watershed Management**: Encourage collaboration between indigenous councils, local governments, and development agencies to develop climate-resilient water management systems.
*   **Support Micro-Hydro Development**: Provide subsidies and infrastructure development for micro-hydro systems that integrate with agroforestry practices.
*   **Develop Climate-Resilient Irrigation Infrastructure**: Invest in scalable irrigation technologies that reduce evaporation losses.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  Conduct a thorough assessment of existing water management practices in the Sahel region to identify areas for improvement.
2.  Develop training programs for indigenous councils on integrated watershed co-management and micro-hydro system installation.
3.  Establish partnerships between local governments, development agencies, and private sector entities to support climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure development.

## Closing Outlook

Watershed co-management with indigenous councils holds significant potential for supporting adaptation targets outlined in NDCs. By integrating traditional knowledge with modern technologies, communities can develop more resilient water management systems that enhance agricultural productivity and promote sustainable livelihoods in the Sahel region.
