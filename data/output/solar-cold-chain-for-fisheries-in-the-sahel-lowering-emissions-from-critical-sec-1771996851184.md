# solar cold-chain for fisheries in the Sahel: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Solar Cold-Chain for Fisheries in the Sahel: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to enhance water security, promote clean energy adoption, and bolster climate resilience in lower-income countries. The primary recommendation is to invest in solar-powered cold-chain systems for fisheries in the Sahel region, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020]. This intervention will also improve food safety and security, while supporting sustainable livelihoods for fishing communities.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring water security, accessing clean energy, and adapting to climate change impacts. Despite progress, only 73.7% of the world has access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024], while Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with just 53.3% electricity access [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]. Renewable energy consumption remains at 19.7% globally [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020], highlighting the urgent need for accelerated efforts.

Climate change exacerbates these challenges by causing more frequent droughts and floods, leading to increased water scarcity and power outages. For example, global temperatures have risen by 1.1°C since pre-industrial levels [Source: IPCC AR6]. To address these issues, governments must prioritize interventions that improve access to clean energy and ensure sustainable water management.

## Analysis

The evidence points toward the necessity of robust policies in enhancing water security, promoting clean energy adoption, and bolstering climate resilience. For instance, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in electricity access [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023], with only 53.3% of its population having reliable power supply. This gap is further compounded by the lack of safe water sources for drinking purposes, affecting health outcomes and economic productivity.

In terms of renewable energy consumption, despite progress, it still remains below global averages [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020]. Lower-income countries can benefit significantly from investments in solar, wind, and hydro power to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. These sustainable energy sources not only mitigate climate change impacts but also provide a stable source of electricity for communities.

Climate adaptation measures are equally critical, especially given the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events [Source: IPCC AR6]. By integrating nature-based solutions like mangrove restoration in coastal areas, governments can enhance resilience against sea-level rise and storm surges. Additionally, supporting climate-resilient agricultural practices such as drought-resistant crops and irrigation systems helps farmers adapt to changing climatic conditions.

## Policy Recommendations

To address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries, the following actionable steps are recommended:

1.  **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Allocate resources towards building boreholes, pipelines, and filtration plants. Implement community-led initiatives for sustainable management of these facilities.
2.  **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage private sector investments through tax incentives or subsidies. Develop local manufacturing capacities for solar panels and wind turbines to reduce import costs.
3.  **Enhance Climate Resilience Measures**: Invest in early warning systems, disaster preparedness plans, and community-based adaptation programs focused on climate-resilient infrastructure projects.

## Implementation Considerations

The feasibility of these recommendations hinges on various factors such as financial resources, institutional capacity, technological readiness, and public participation. Governments must ensure that policy frameworks are equitable and inclusive to achieve widespread adoption. For instance, providing subsidies for solar-powered water pumps can significantly reduce costs for rural households without compromising economic viability.

Moreover, partnerships between governments, NGOs, and the private sector are essential for scaling up interventions effectively. Collaborative efforts will help leverage diverse resources while fostering innovation in technology transfer and capacity building.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries require urgent intervention to secure their futures by enhancing water security, promoting clean energy adoption, and bolstering climate resilience. By implementing evidence-based policies and engaging all stakeholders, these nations can build sustainable development pathways that protect the environment and improve livelihoods for generations to come.
