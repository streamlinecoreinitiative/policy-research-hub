# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Great Lakes region: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing clean water (32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water) and reliable electricity (53.3% have access to grid electricity). To address these issues, we recommend prioritizing infrastructure development, investing in renewable energy projects, and implementing climate adaptation strategies.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) compared to other regions globally, with only 73.7% of the world's population having access to this essential resource [1]. Less than half of the population (53.3%) has access to grid electricity, with rural areas being disproportionately affected [2]. Renewable energy consumption is a mere 10% of total final energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa, lagging behind global averages [3].

## Analysis

### Water Security

The region lacks sufficient water resources for sustainable development and climate adaptation (9.2% freshwater withdrawal) [4]. Poor infrastructure exacerbates the problem, leading to frequent water scarcity. For instance, a study found that 40% of households in rural areas reported using untreated surface water or unimproved sources for drinking [5].

### Clean Energy Access

Limited access to electricity is a significant barrier to economic growth and social development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rural areas are particularly underserved, with only 53.3% of households having access to electricity [2]. This has severe consequences on education, healthcare, and livelihoods.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts disproportionately affect vulnerable populations without adequate water security or clean energy infrastructure. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns exacerbate droughts and floods, leading to food insecurity and displacement.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Infrastructure Development**:
	* Invest in rural water supply and sanitation projects to increase access to safely managed drinking water by 40% within the next five years.
	* Implement microgrids and renewable energy mini-grids to provide reliable electricity for remote communities, with a focus on solar-powered solutions.
2. **Renewable Energy Projects**:
	* Increase renewable energy consumption from current levels to at least 15% of total final energy consumption by 2030 [6].
	* Encourage public-private partnerships (PPP) and international financing to support the development of wind, solar, and hydro power projects.
3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
	* Establish early-warning systems for droughts and floods using satellite data and IoT sensors in vulnerable areas.
	* Promote climate-resilient agriculture practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties and irrigation technologies.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in infrastructure development (e.g., water supply, sanitation) can range from $10 to $20 per person for rural communities [7]. Renewable energy mini-grids may cost between $5,000 to $10,000 per household. Potential barriers include resistance from local authorities and community leaders who may be skeptical of new technologies or infrastructure projects.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must urgently address water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience through targeted policy interventions. By prioritizing these areas, the region can pave the way for sustainable development and improved quality of life for its citizens.
