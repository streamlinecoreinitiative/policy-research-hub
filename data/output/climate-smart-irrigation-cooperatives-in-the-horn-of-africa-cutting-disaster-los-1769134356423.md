**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Horn of Africa: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa. These cooperatives will not only enhance water security through efficient irrigation practices but also promote renewable energy use and build resilience against climate impacts. By investing in these initiatives, governments and development partners can reduce disaster losses for vulnerable groups and create a more sustainable future.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with severe water security and clean energy access challenges. According to the World Bank (2024), only 32.4% of the region's population has access to safely managed drinking water, leaving a substantial portion at risk [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Similarly, the region lags behind in renewable energy consumption, with just 19.7% compared to a global average of 19.7% (World Bank, 2020). The Horn of Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate-related risks, including droughts and floods, which affect millions of people.

## Analysis

The challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa are exacerbated by its reliance on non-renewable energy sources, which contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, renewable energy consumption in the region is limited, hindering progress towards climate goals (World Bank, 2020). Furthermore, the region's water security challenges are compounded by inefficient irrigation practices, which waste significant amounts of freshwater resources [VERIFY: Freshwater withdrawal % of resources - World, 2021].

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Establishing Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Invest in infrastructure projects that promote efficient irrigation practices and renewable energy use, such as solar-powered irrigation systems.
2. **Increasing Renewable Energy Investment**: Provide subsidies for households and small businesses to adopt clean energy solutions, such as solar panels or wind turbines.
3. **Developing Early Warning Systems**: Implement climate-resilient agricultural practices and water management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require significant funding, which can be sourced from international development partners, domestic budgets, or a combination thereof. To manage costs effectively, prioritize projects that have both immediate benefits (e.g., improved access to clean water) and long-term sustainability (e.g., renewable energy infrastructure). Engage local communities in planning and decision-making processes to ensure ownership and effectiveness.

## Conclusion

Addressing the environmental resilience challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa requires concerted efforts focused on enhancing water security, promoting clean energy access, and bolstering climate adaptation. By taking swift action today, we can create a more resilient future for all citizens of this region. Let us work together to achieve these goals by establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Horn of Africa.
