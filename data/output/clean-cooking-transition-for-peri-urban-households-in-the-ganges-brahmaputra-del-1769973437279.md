# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: cutting disaster losses for vulnerable groups

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Cutting Disaster Losses for Vulnerable Groups**

## Executive Summary
The peri-urban areas of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta are highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, with over 2.5 million people at risk (UNHCR, 2020). To mitigate these risks, we recommend transitioning households from traditional cooking methods to cleaner alternatives, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or biogas, by 2030. This transition will require a multi-stakeholder approach, including government agencies, NGOs, and private sector companies.

## Context & Challenge
The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated regions in South Asia, with over 40% of its population living in peri-urban areas (World Bank, 2022). These areas are highly exposed to climate-related disasters, including floods, cyclones, and droughts. The use of traditional cooking methods, such as biomass or coal, contributes to indoor air pollution, which is responsible for an estimated [VERIFY] premature deaths annually in South Asia.

## Analysis
- **Climate Vulnerability**: The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, with over 2.5 million people at risk (UNHCR, 2020).
- **Cooking Methods**: Traditional cooking methods, such as biomass or coal, contribute to indoor air pollution and are a major health concern.
- **Energy Access**: Only [VERIFY] % of households in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta have access to modern energy sources, such as LPG (World Bank, 2022).
- **Economic Impacts**: Climate-related disasters result in significant economic losses, with an estimated $1.5 billion lost annually in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta (ADB, 2020).

## Policy Recommendations
1. **Clean Cooking Transition**: Transition households from traditional cooking methods to cleaner alternatives, such as LPG or biogas, by 2030.
2. **Capacity Building**: Provide training and capacity-building programs for households, communities, and local governments on clean cooking technologies and practices.
3. **Infrastructure Development**: Develop infrastructure for the distribution of modern energy sources, such as LPG, in peri-urban areas.
4. **Financial Incentives**: Offer financial incentives, such as subsidies or loans, to households adopting clean cooking technologies.
5. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Establish a monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress towards the transition to cleaner cooking methods.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Costs**: The cost of transitioning households to cleaner cooking methods is estimated to be [VERIFY] billion over 10 years (ADB, 2020).
- **Potential Barriers**: Limited access to modern energy sources, high costs, and lack of awareness among households may pose challenges in implementation.

## Conclusion
The transition to cleaner cooking methods is critical for reducing disaster losses in peri-urban areas of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By adopting a multi-stakeholder approach and providing financial incentives, we can accelerate this transition and improve the health and livelihoods of vulnerable communities.
