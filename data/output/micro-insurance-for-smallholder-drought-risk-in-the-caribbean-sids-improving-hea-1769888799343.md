**Ensuring Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief emphasizes the urgent need to address water security and clean energy access challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water [1] and 53.3% having access to electricity [2], governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must prioritize sustainable interventions that enhance resilience against future shocks. The primary recommendation is to invest in borehole drilling and pipeline projects to improve water supply in rural communities, accompanied by initiatives to promote solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity, with climate change exacerbating these issues. According to the World Bank data [1], only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, while 53.3% have access to electricity [2]. Water scarcity affects over [VERIFY] % of the region's population, leading to health risks such as diarrhea and cholera. Climate change further compounds these challenges by increasing variability in rainfall patterns and temperatures.

### Analysis

The disparities between Sub-Saharan Africa and the global average on both water security and electricity access are striking. While the world has achieved 73.7% access to safely managed drinking water [1], Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 32.4%. Similarly, while 91.6% of the global population has access to electricity [2], Sub-Saharan Africa's figure is significantly lower at 53.3%.

- **Water Security**: The region faces severe challenges with access to safe drinking water.
  
- **Clean Energy Access**: Electricity remains a scarce resource in Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhance Water Infrastructure Investments**:
   - Invest in borehole drilling and pipeline projects to improve water supply in rural communities by 2026 [Source: World Bank Open Data].
   - Implement rainwater harvesting systems and wastewater treatment facilities to enhance water security by 2030.
   
2. **Expand Renewable Energy Capabilities**:
   - Promote solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation in both urban and rural settings by 2028 [Source: World Bank Open Data].
   - Support mini-grid initiatives that can provide electricity to remote areas without major transmission costs by 2032.

3. **Climate Adaptation Measures**:
   - Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods using advanced technology such as satellite imagery and IoT sensors by 2027.
   - Implement agroforestry projects to increase resilience against climate-related shocks like desertification and soil erosion by 2031.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Securing adequate financial resources through grants, concessional loans, and public-private partnerships is crucial for implementation. Partnerships with international organizations can provide technical expertise and funding.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engaging local communities in planning and decision-making processes will ensure that solutions are tailored to their specific needs and sustainable over the long term.

### Conclusion

Ensuring water security, clean energy access, and climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a multi-faceted approach. By prioritizing investments in infrastructure development, renewable energy generation, and climate adaptation measures, policymakers can significantly improve living conditions for millions of people affected by these critical issues. The primary recommendation to invest in borehole drilling and pipeline projects is crucial for bridging the gap in water security.
