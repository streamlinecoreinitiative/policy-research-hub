# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Indus watershed: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy Access & Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation challenges in lower-income countries. We recommend implementing micro-insurance schemes for smallholder farmers to mitigate drought risks, investing in decentralized renewable energy solutions like microgrids, and strengthening early warning systems for climate-related disasters. By adopting these evidence-based policies, decision-makers can build more resilient communities that thrive despite environmental stresses.

### Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face significant challenges related to water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. Access to safely managed drinking water is a pressing issue in Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 32.4% of the population has access compared to the world average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Energy poverty is equally severe, with electricity access at just 53.3%, significantly lower than global levels (91.6%) [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Renewable energy consumption remains stagnant at 19.7%, far below the SDG target of 40% by 2030 [Source: World Bank Open Data].

### Analysis

The data reveals stark disparities in access to essential services between lower-income countries and developed regions. In Sub-Saharan Africa, water scarcity hinders economic productivity and public health outcomes. For instance, a 2024 World Bank report states that only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, leading to increased incidences of waterborne diseases such as cholera [Source: World Bank Open Data]. Similarly, electricity access is limited, with just 53.3%, affecting sectors like agriculture and healthcare.

### Policy Recommendations

To enhance environmental resilience, governments and development partners should prioritize the following interventions:

1. **Water Security**: Implement large-scale water infrastructure projects to improve access to clean drinking water. Develop community-managed water systems such as rainwater harvesting ponds and solar-powered wells.
2. **Clean Energy Access**: Promote decentralized renewable energy solutions like microgrids for rural clinics, schools, and health centers. Invest in off-grid solar power systems that can be installed at low cost and operate efficiently on limited resources.
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Strengthen early warning systems to predict climate-related disasters such as floods and droughts.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require significant upfront investments in infrastructure and technology. However, cost-effective options exist that can be scaled up with strategic public-private partnerships. For instance, micro-insurance schemes for smallholder farmers can mitigate drought risks while reducing government subsidies. Community-managed water systems are also financially viable when implemented through participatory planning processes.

### Conclusion

Addressing the challenges of water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries is essential for sustainable development. By adopting evidence-based policies and leveraging existing resources, decision-makers can build more resilient communities that thrive despite environmental stresses. Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private sector entities will be crucial to realizing these goals.
