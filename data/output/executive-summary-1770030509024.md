**Improving Water Security, Clean Energy Access, and Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Dual Focus on Renewable Energy and Safe Drinking Water**

## Executive Summary
To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity and energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend increasing public and private sector investment in renewable energy projects to meet the region's growing energy needs. This can be achieved by allocating $[VERIFY] billion annually for solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects over the next five years. Additionally, we suggest developing rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants to address freshwater shortages, with a focus on areas most vulnerable to climate change impacts.

## Context & Challenge
Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity. According to World Bank data (2024), only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water [1], compared to 73.7% globally [2]. Similarly, despite global progress in electricity coverage at 91.6%, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with a rate of 53.3% [3]. Climate change exacerbates these issues, leading to more frequent droughts and floods that further strain water resources.

## Analysis
The region's limited access to clean energy sources hinders economic growth and exacerbates water scarcity during dry periods. Renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7%, far below the world average [4]. This disparity is particularly concerning given the region's high potential for solar and wind power. Moreover, Sub-Saharan Africa has a freshwater withdrawal rate of only 9.2%, highlighting its vulnerability to climate-induced fluctuations [5].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Expand Renewable Energy Investment**: Allocate $[VERIFY] billion annually for five years to support solar, wind, and hydroelectric projects in Sub-Saharan Africa.
2. **Enhance Water Infrastructure**: Develop rainwater harvesting systems and desalination plants to address freshwater shortages, with a focus on areas most vulnerable to climate change impacts.
3. **Promote Clean Cooking Solutions**: Introduce subsidies for clean cooking stoves, such as biogas digesters, to reduce indoor air pollution and deforestation caused by wood use.

## Implementation Considerations
Initial investments will require significant funding but can be offset through grants and loans from international organizations. Operational costs are relatively low once established. Collaboration with local communities, NGOs, and private sector partners can help overcome technical expertise and infrastructure challenges.

## Conclusion
Sub-Saharan Africa needs urgent action to secure its water resources and energy supply while adapting to climate change impacts. By focusing on renewable energy and clean water solutions, policymakers can create a more resilient future for the region's population. We emphasize the importance of prioritizing these interventions to ensure sustainable development and improve the quality of life for millions of people.
