# Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sahel: Enhancing Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

The Sahel region faces severe environmental challenges, including water scarcity, soil degradation, and climate change impacts on agriculture. This brief highlights the importance of watershed co-management with indigenous councils as a key strategy to enhance resilience finance for communities in the region.

## I. Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Sahel

The Sahel region is characterized by arid and semi-arid conditions, making it vulnerable to droughts and erratic rainfall patterns. Climate change projections indicate a decrease in precipitation, exacerbating water scarcity and its impacts on agriculture (1). The region's population relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate variability.

## II. Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Sahel are often inefficient, relying on boreholes, canals, or diesel-powered pumps. These methods result in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage (2).

## III. Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, while reducing erosion and increasing water retention (3). By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, communities can enhance their resilience to climate-related shocks and stresses.

## IV. Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a promising solution for efficient irrigation in the Sahel. These small-scale hydroelectric systems harness energy from rivers or streams, reducing reliance on diesel generators (4).

## V. Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. These integrated approaches not only improve water security but also provide economic benefits through reduced energy costs and increased crop yields.

## Actions/Recommendations:

1.  **Establish a watershed co-management framework** with indigenous councils to ensure community-led decision-making and implementation.
2.  **Develop a comprehensive financing plan**, including subsidies, low-interest loans, and infrastructure development support.
3.  **Conduct further research** on the long-term sustainability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The proposed approach offers a promising solution to address water scarcity and climate change impacts in the Sahel region. By combining watershed co-management with indigenous councils, agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, and climate-resilient irrigation methods, communities can enhance their resilience finance and adapt to changing environmental conditions.
