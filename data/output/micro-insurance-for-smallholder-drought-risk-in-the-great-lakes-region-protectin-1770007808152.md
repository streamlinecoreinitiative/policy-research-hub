# micro-insurance for smallholder drought risk in the Great Lakes region: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Climate Resilient Water Security, Clean Energy, and Adaptation Strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Multi-Faceted Approach**

## Executive Summary

To address the triple challenge of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend prioritizing access to clean water, promoting renewable energy consumption, and enhancing climate resilience. Specifically, we propose increasing access to safely managed drinking water by [VERIFY] (from 32.4% to [NEEDS SOURCE]), expanding renewable energy consumption to at least 12%, and strengthening early warning systems for climate events. By taking these actions, we can significantly reduce poverty and improve livelihoods in the region.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing severe water scarcity and electricity shortages, exacerbated by climate variability and change (IPCC, 2020). Only about 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024), compared to a global average of [VERIFY] (World Bank, 2024). Additionally, only 53.3% of the region's population has access to electricity (World Bank, 2023), far below the world average of 91.6% (World Bank, 2023).

## Analysis

The interplay between water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa presents a critical challenge. For instance, countries like Ethiopia and South Sudan have faced severe droughts that have impacted agricultural productivity and public health (FAO, 2019). Water shortages also lead to increased competition for resources among communities (UN-Water/WHO, 2022).

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Water Security**: Implement large-scale water infrastructure projects such as desalination plants and groundwater exploration to increase access to clean water. Provide subsidies or grants to households for water purification systems and support community-based management of shared water resources.
	* Data: World Bank (2024): safely managed drinking water (% of population, Sub-Saharan Africa) = 32.4
2. **Promoting Renewable Energy**: Increase the share of renewable energy consumption by at least [VERIFY] in Sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on solar and wind power. Encourage private sector investment through favorable policies such as feed-in tariffs or tax incentives for renewable energy projects.
	* Data: World Bank (2020): renewable energy consumption (% of TFEC, world) = 19.7
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Strengthen early warning systems and disaster preparedness mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Collaborate with local communities in watershed co-management initiatives, such as indigenous councils, to enhance resilience against droughts and floods.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires significant investment and collaboration between governments, international organizations, and the private sector. Governments should prioritize funding for water infrastructure projects and renewable energy initiatives. Collaboration with local communities is crucial to ensure successful implementation of climate adaptation strategies.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's triple challenge of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability demands immediate attention from policymakers. By prioritizing access to clean water, promoting renewable energy, and enhancing climate resilience, we can create a more sustainable and resilient future for the region. Let us take action now to support these essential interventions.

**Call to Action**: Governments should prioritize funding for water infrastructure projects, expand renewable energy initiatives, and strengthen early warning systems for climate events in Sub-Saharan Africa. NGOs, international organizations, and private sector partners must also contribute to this effort by providing resources and expertise where needed.
