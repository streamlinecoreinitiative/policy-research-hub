**Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Lower Mekong Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the critical need for integrated policy solutions to address water security, energy access, and climate resilience challenges. We recommend prioritizing investments in renewable energy for both electricity generation and water pumping systems, and integrating climate adaptation strategies into all development projects.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water security, energy access, and climate resilience. The region has one of the lowest rates of access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) compared to the world average [1]. Renewable energy consumption remains below 10% in the region, despite global trends towards cleaner energy sources [2].

## Analysis

### Water Security

Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan African populations have access to safely managed drinking water, with the highest rates concentrated in urban areas versus rural areas [1]. This disparity underscores the urgent need for sustainable water supply solutions.

### Renewable Energy Access

The region lags behind globally and even compared to other regions such as Southeast Asia (9.4% renewable energy consumption) [2]. Limited access hampers efforts towards climate resilience, especially in remote areas where solar power could provide reliable energy sources.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Renewable Energy for Water Supply**: Utilize solar-powered pumps and desalination systems to enhance water availability in arid regions.
2. **Enhance Hydropower Development**: Leverage existing rivers and reservoirs to generate electricity, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels and improving energy security.
3. **Integrate Climate Adaptation Measures**: Incorporate climate-smart agriculture practices into renewable energy projects to ensure long-term resilience against weather extremes.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investment in solar pumps and desalination systems can be substantial but may be offset by potential savings from reduced fuel costs and improved health outcomes [3]. Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities is crucial for successful implementation. Costs and technical expertise are key hurdles that need to be addressed through innovative financing mechanisms and capacity building programs.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must accelerate its transition to renewable energy sources to address pressing water security and climate adaptation challenges. By integrating these solutions into broader development frameworks, the region can achieve a more resilient and sustainable future.
