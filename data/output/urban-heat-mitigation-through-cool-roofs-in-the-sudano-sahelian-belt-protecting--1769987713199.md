**Climate Resilient Water Supply Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: Strengthening Energy Access and Renewable Integration**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safely managed drinking water (32.4% of the population, World Bank Open Data 2024) and reliable energy services (53.3% electricity access, World Bank Open Data 2023). To address these gaps, we recommend implementing climate-resilient water supply systems that integrate solar, wind, and hydro power to improve both water security and energy access.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions with the lowest levels of electricity access (53.3%, World Bank Open Data 2023) and poorest progress in renewable energy consumption ([VERIFY] 10% of final energy consumption, World Bank Open Data 2020). Climate change exacerbates existing challenges, threatening water resources and increasing demand for reliable energy services.

## Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's freshwater withdrawal is significantly lower than global averages (9.2%, World Bank Open Data 2021), indicating potential for improvement in water management practices. Despite a significant increase from previous years ([VERIFY] 50% in 2014, World Bank Open Data), the continent still struggles with energy poverty and inefficiencies.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Implement solar-powered water systems**: Integrate photovoltaic panels into existing water supply systems to improve access to safe drinking water.
2. **Promote microgrids and off-grid solutions**: Enhance reliability in remote areas by integrating small-scale wind turbines with existing energy infrastructure.
3. **Encourage hybrid renewable energy systems**: Focus on cost-effective integration of multiple technologies (solar, wind, hydro) for large-scale projects.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments may be high but can be offset by long-term savings and improved health outcomes from better water security. Limited technical expertise, lack of funding, and resistance to change in traditional energy models are significant barriers that need addressing through capacity building programs and financial incentives.

## Conclusion

Governments should prioritize climate-resilient water supply systems integrating renewable energy sources as a critical component of their development strategies. We call on governments to develop pilot projects, provide technical assistance, and promote public-private partnerships to accelerate implementation and ensure sustainability.
