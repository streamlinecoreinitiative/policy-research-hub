**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

The Sub-Saharan Africa region is facing a triple challenge of water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. To address these issues, we recommend investing in water infrastructure projects to increase access to safe drinking water, particularly in rural areas where it is most lacking. This includes implementing community-based management models for sustainable long-term use. Furthermore, we suggest accelerating renewable energy deployment through tax incentives, grants, and regulatory frameworks that support the growth of renewable energy projects. Focus on off-grid solar solutions to reach remote communities not served by grid electricity. Additionally, enhance climate adaptation measures by developing early warning systems for climate-related disasters using satellite data and ground-based sensors.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with severe water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability. Access to safe drinking water is woefully inadequate at 32.4% (World Bank Open Data), while electricity access stands at a mere [VERIFY]%. The region also faces significant climate risks, including increased frequency and intensity of droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.

## Analysis

The challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa are compounded by inadequate infrastructure, economic limitations, and political instability. Water scarcity disproportionately affects rural communities who rely on unsafe water sources for daily use, leading to outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and dysentery (World Health Organization). The lack of access to electricity exacerbates the region's development gap, limiting opportunities for education, healthcare, and economic growth.

The renewable energy sector is also lagging behind global targets, with only [VERIFY]% of final energy consumption coming from renewables in SSA (World Bank Open Data). This disparity underscores the need for more robust investment in solar, wind, and hydro power to meet SDG 6 (clean water) and 7 (affordable and clean energy).

Climate change poses an even greater threat, as evidenced by recent climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods that have displaced millions and disrupted agricultural yields. Vulnerable populations are particularly at risk, with limited resources for adaptation measures.

## Policy Recommendations

To address these critical issues, we recommend the following:

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in water infrastructure projects such as wells, boreholes, and rainwater harvesting systems. Prioritize rural areas where access is most lacking. Implement community-based management models for sustainable long-term use.
2. **Accelerate Renewable Energy Deployment**: Encourage private sector investment through tax incentives, grants, and regulatory frameworks that support the growth of renewable energy projects. Focus on off-grid solar solutions to reach remote communities not served by grid electricity.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Measures**: Develop early warning systems for climate-related disasters using satellite data and ground-based sensors. Implement drought-resistant crops and water-efficient irrigation technologies in agriculture. Provide micro-insurance schemes that cover smallholder farmers against weather-induced losses, ensuring financial stability during crises.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires a multi-stakeholder approach involving government agencies, NGOs, international donors, private sector entities, and local communities. Key challenges include securing adequate funding, addressing regulatory hurdles, and ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across different socio-economic groups.

The initial investment in infrastructure development will yield significant returns over time through improved health outcomes, reduced disease prevalence, increased economic productivity, and enhanced resilience against climate-related shocks. By prioritizing these interventions, Sub-Saharan Africa can make substantial progress toward achieving the SDGs related to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa urgently needs comprehensive strategies that tackle water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate vulnerability simultaneously. Through targeted policy actions supported by strong implementation frameworks, the region can build a more resilient future for its people.

**Call to Action**: Governments, NGOs, and development practitioners must collaborate on these initiatives to accelerate progress toward achieving SDG 6 (clean water), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and climate resilience goals in Sub-Saharan Africa. Increased support from international partners is crucial to overcoming the remaining barriers and ensuring sustainable outcomes.

**Next Steps**: Establish dedicated task forces within government ministries responsible for overseeing and coordinating efforts related to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. Engage with civil society organizations and private sector entities to leverage their expertise and resources in implementing these policies effectively. Regularly review progress against set targets and make necessary adjustments based on feedback from all stakeholders involved.
