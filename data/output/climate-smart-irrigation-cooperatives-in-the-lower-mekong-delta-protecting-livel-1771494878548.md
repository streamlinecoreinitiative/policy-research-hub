**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Lower Mekong Delta: Protecting Livelihoods Under Climate Stress**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief outlines a comprehensive approach to improve water security, increase clean energy access, and bolster climate resilience. With significant environmental challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa due to its arid and semi-arid regions, limited natural resources, and rapid population growth, urgent action is required.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant environmental challenges due to its arid and semi-arid regions, limited natural resources, and rapid population growth. The region's water security is further compromised by poor sanitation facilities, inadequate water supply infrastructure, and limited financial resources (World Bank Data). Climate variability exacerbates these challenges, leading to more frequent droughts and floods that impact agricultural productivity and water availability for irrigation.

## Analysis

- **Water Security**: Sub-Saharan Africa's population lacks safe drinking water at 32.4%, with only 73.7% globally having access (World Bank Data). This disparity is due to poor sanitation facilities, inadequate water supply infrastructure, and limited financial resources.
- **Clean Energy Access**: Only 53.3% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has electricity, compared to the world average of 91.6%. The region lags behind on renewable energy consumption at 19.7%, highlighting a critical gap in meeting sustainable development goals (SDG 6).
- **Climate Adaptation**: Climate variability affects agricultural productivity and water availability for irrigation, leading to food insecurity and economic instability.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**:
	* Collaborate with local communities to establish cooperative ownership of irrigation infrastructure.
	* Implement climate-resilient agriculture practices through training programs and provision of drought-tolerant crop varieties.
	* Leverage existing water supply infrastructure for efficient water management.
2. **Enhance Water Supply Infrastructure**:
	* Invest in building and maintaining boreholes, wells, and pipelines to improve access to safe drinking water (estimated costs: [VERIFY] $10 million per borehole well system).
	* Allocate funds from existing development budgets and seek concessional financing options like World Bank loans.
3. **Increase Renewable Energy Deployment**:
	* Increase the share of renewable energy consumption by at least 50% within five years through subsidies for solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric projects (World Bank Data).
	* Implement policies that mandate a minimum percentage of electricity generated from renewables in national grids.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cost Estimates**: Estimated costs for enhancing water supply infrastructure could range from [VERIFY] $10 million per borehole well system.
- **Barriers to Action**: Political resistance due to short-term financial constraints, lack of technical expertise in renewable energy projects, and limited public awareness about climate change impacts.

## Conclusion

By focusing on improving water security, increasing clean energy access, and enhancing climate resilience through climate-smart irrigation cooperatives, Sub-Saharan Africa can significantly improve living standards while contributing to global efforts against climate change. Stakeholders must come together to implement these recommendations within feasible timeframes, leveraging existing resources and international partnerships for sustainable outcomes.
