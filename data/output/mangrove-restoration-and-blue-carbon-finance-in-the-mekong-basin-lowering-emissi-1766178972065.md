# Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Mekong Basin: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors

## Executive Summary

The Lower Mekong Basin faces severe water scarcity due to climate change, threatening food security and economic stability for vulnerable communities. This brief explores an innovative solution: integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation. Agroforestry enhances soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, while micro-hydro technology reduces reliance on diesel generators and increases energy efficiency.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Lower Mekong Basin

The Lower Mekong Basin is a vital agricultural region facing significant water scarcity challenges due to climate change. Rising sea levels and increased salinity intrusion are affecting crop yields and food security, particularly for vulnerable communities (UN Environment Programme, 2020).

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Lower Mekong Basin face significant water loss through evaporation and seepage. Studies have shown that traditional irrigation methods result in substantial water loss, but specific percentages are not provided [verify].

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry systems have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration (ASEAN Secretariat, 2018). Case studies demonstrate how agroforestry can reduce erosion and improve water retention.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution for irrigation efficiency. Small-scale hydroelectric systems can generate energy from water flows, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency (World Bank, 2020).

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro technology for climate-resilient irrigation. These integrated systems can improve water security, reduce energy costs, and enhance community resilience to climate-related shocks (UN Environment Programme, 2020).

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems at scale:

1. Governments should provide incentives for farmers to adopt these integrated systems.
2. Financial institutions should offer loans with favorable terms for agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3. Research institutions should conduct further studies on the economic and social benefits of these integrated systems.

## Closing Outlook

The Lower Mekong Basin is facing significant water scarcity challenges due to climate change. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution for climate-resilient irrigation, improving water security, reducing energy costs, and enhancing community resilience.

## Data Gaps

- Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected regions in the Lower Mekong Basin.
- Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
- Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions.
