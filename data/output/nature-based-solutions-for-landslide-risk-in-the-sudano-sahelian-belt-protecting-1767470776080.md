# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: protecting livelihoods under climate stress

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress**

### Executive Summary

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, characterized by frequent droughts and landslides that threaten agricultural productivity and human settlements. This brief proposes an integrated approach to address water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation through nature-based solutions in lower-income countries.

### Introduction

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity in the Sudano-Sahelian belt, impacting agriculture and livelihoods. The region's average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify]. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, resulting in significant water losses [verify].

### Climate Resilience through Agroforestry

Agroforestry plays a crucial role in climate resilience by improving soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Benefits of agroforestry include:

* Soil organic matter increases: [verify]
* Biodiversity increase: [verify]
* Carbon sequestration: [verify]

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, offering significant advantages over traditional irrigation methods.

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective solutions for climate-resilient water supply. However, specific project costs and return on investment (ROI) estimates are not provided [verify].

### Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems, policy measures are necessary:

* Subsidies for farmers: Incentives to encourage adoption of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Grid integration: Integration with micro-hydro systems to enhance reliability and efficiency
* Infrastructure development: Improvements in roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure

### Actions/Recommendations

1. Conduct thorough socioeconomic studies to assess community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop and implement policies that provide incentives for farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3. Invest in grid integration and infrastructure development to enhance the reliability and efficiency of micro-hydro systems.

### Closing Outlook

The proposed solution offers a promising approach to addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in lower-income countries. By integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems, communities can build resilience against climate stress while promoting sustainable agricultural development.
