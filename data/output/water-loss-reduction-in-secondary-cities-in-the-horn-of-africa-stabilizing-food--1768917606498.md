**Enhancing Environmental Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: Prioritizing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable energy sources, compounded by climate change impacts. To improve the resilience of communities and support sustainable development goals, we recommend investing heavily in infrastructure projects for clean water supply and sanitation, promoting the use of renewable energy sources to meet growing electricity demand sustainably, and implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices and early warning systems.

* Invest $100 million to $500 million per project in infrastructure projects for clean water supply and sanitation. [VERIFY]
* Promote the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro for rural electrification.
* Implement climate-resilient agricultural practices and develop early warning systems for droughts and floods.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 13 countries with access rates below 50% for safely managed drinking water. The region also lags behind in renewable energy consumption, with only 19.7%. Climate change is increasing the severity of droughts and floods, threatening existing infrastructure (World Bank Open Data).

Improving these areas can prevent widespread health crises and economic disruptions. Addressing climate impacts through resilient investments ensures long-term sustainability. According to the UN SDG Report 2023, safely managed water coverage has reached 74% globally, but only 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Analysis

### Evidence on Water Security

* Access to safely managed drinking water: 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank Open Data).
* Climate change is expected to reduce agricultural productivity in many countries, leading to increased competition for water resources and higher costs.
* The global population lacking safe water is estimated at 2.2 billion people (UN-Water/WHO).

### Renewable Energy Consumption

* The region's reliance on fossil fuels poses significant environmental risks, including air pollution and climate emissions (World Bank Open Data).
* Increased investment in renewable energy is critical for reducing these impacts while meeting growing energy demands.

### Climate Adaptation

* Climate change exacerbates existing water scarcity issues, with Sub-Saharan Africa facing an average temperature rise of 1.1°C since pre-industrial times (IPCC AR6).
* Early warning systems and climate-resilient agricultural practices are essential for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events.

## Policy Recommendations

### Policy Recommendation 1: Invest in Infrastructure Projects for Water Security

* Increase funding for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure projects.
* Implement community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs to promote safe water access and improved sanitation facilities.

### Policy Recommendation 2: Promote Renewable Energy Sources

* Encourage the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro for rural electrification.
* Implement feed-in tariffs to incentivize private sector investment in renewable energy projects.

### Policy Recommendation 3: Implement Climate Resilient Practices

* Develop early warning systems for droughts and floods, particularly in vulnerable regions.
* Promote climate-resilient agricultural practices such as crop diversification, improved irrigation techniques, and soil conservation measures.

## Implementation Considerations

Establish clear implementation timelines and allocate dedicated budget lines for each recommendation. Initial investment costs range from $100 million to $500 million per project, with ongoing operational expenses estimated at 2% of the initial cost annually. Potential barriers include resistance from communities skeptical about new infrastructure projects and limited government funding.

## Conclusion

Governments, NGOs, and development partners must collaborate to implement these recommendations. Immediate investments in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation are critical for building a more resilient future for Sub-Saharan Africa. Conduct baseline assessments of current infrastructure projects and vulnerabilities, and develop detailed implementation plans with cost projections and stakeholder engagement strategies.
