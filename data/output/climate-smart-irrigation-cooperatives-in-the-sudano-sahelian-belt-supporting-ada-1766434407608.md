# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and erratic rainfall patterns. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating the economic burden on smallholder farmers. This brief proposes integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems as a solution to address water scarcity in this region.

**Climate Change Impacts and Current Irrigation Practices**

Climate change is characterized by erratic rainfall patterns, with average annual rainfall ranging from 800-1200 mm [verify] and precipitation variability between 600-1400 mm. Traditional irrigation systems lose significant amounts of water due to evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%). These methods are also energy-intensive, consuming a significant amount of electricity per borehole pump.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health by increasing organic matter [verify]%, biodiversity by introducing native species, and carbon sequestration. Case studies from other regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving agricultural productivity while mitigating climate change impacts.

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, with power generation ranging from 10-50 kW per system [verify] and an energy efficiency rate of 70-80%. These systems offer significant cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects can provide cost-effective solutions, with a total project cost per hectare ranging from $10,000-$25,000 [verify]. Long-term sustainability assessments are essential to ensure the success of these projects.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives. Incentives for farmers, grid integration with micro-hydro systems, and infrastructure development are crucial policy recommendations. Future research directions include economic impact assessments, community acceptance studies, and long-term sustainability evaluations.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop and implement policies supporting the adoption of climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives in NDCs.**
2.  **Provide incentives for farmers to invest in integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.**
3.  **Invest in infrastructure development, including roads and storage facilities, to support the growth of micro-hydro systems.**

**Closing Outlook**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt faces significant climate-related challenges, but integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution. By supporting adaptation targets in NDCs, climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives can contribute to sustainable development goals while improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.
