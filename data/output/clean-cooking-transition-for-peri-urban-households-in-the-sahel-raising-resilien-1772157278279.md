**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Sahel: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

## Executive Summary

We recommend that governments, NGOs, and international organizations prioritize investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation to build resilient systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. This brief highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions across these three areas, with a focus on peri-urban households in the Sahel region. Key recommendations include increasing funding for water infrastructure, promoting renewable energy projects, and enhancing early warning systems.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan African countries face significant gaps in access to safe drinking water (32.4%)[1] and electricity (53.3%)[2], exacerbating health outcomes and economic disparities. Climate variability causes frequent droughts and floods, disrupting agricultural cycles and increasing food insecurity[3]. The region struggles with inadequate sanitation facilities (32.4%), leading to high rates of waterborne diseases.

## Analysis

The data underscores the critical need for interventions that address both immediate needs (water security) and long-term sustainability (clean energy access). For instance:

- **Water Security**: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has access to safely managed drinking water, leaving millions at risk from waterborne diseases[1].
- **Clean Energy Access**: The region lags behind the world average in renewable energy consumption, with only [VERIFY]19.7%[2]. This disparity is compounded by the fact that over 2 billion people globally lack safe water sources[4].

## Policy Recommendations

To tackle these challenges effectively:

1. **Expand Water Infrastructure Funding**: Increase public and private investments to improve sanitation facilities and access to clean water. Allocate a significant portion of national budgets towards water infrastructure development.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Projects**: Support solar, wind, and hydropower projects to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enhance energy security. Encourage collaboration between governments, NGOs, and international organizations to leverage resources and expertise.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Measures**: Implement early warning systems for climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods, improving preparedness and response times.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Budgeting**: Allocate a significant portion of national budgets towards water infrastructure development and renewable energy projects to ensure sustainability.
- **Partnerships**: Encourage collaboration between governments, NGOs, and international organizations to leverage resources and expertise.
- **Monitoring & Evaluation**: Establish robust monitoring mechanisms to track progress and make necessary adjustments.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation. By doing so, it can build resilient systems that safeguard its people against immediate crises while fostering long-term economic stability. This brief serves as a call to action for policymakers to implement these recommendations promptly to achieve sustainable development goals.
