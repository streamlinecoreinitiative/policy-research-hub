# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Indus Watershed: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities

## Executive Summary

This brief highlights the importance of addressing environmental resilience in lower-income countries, focusing on water security and climate adaptation. The proposed project aims to develop climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Indus watershed by integrating agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Critical Overview

### Water Security Challenges in the Indus Watershed

The Indus watershed, spanning across Pakistan, India, and China, faces significant water security challenges due to climate change. Erratic rainfall patterns, changing temperature regimes, and increased evaporation rates have led to severe water scarcity [verify]. This has far-reaching implications for agriculture, food security, and economic stability.

### Clean Energy Opportunities in the Indus Watershed

The region offers vast potential for renewable energy adoption, particularly in micro-hydro systems. These small-scale hydroelectric systems can provide reliable and clean energy while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems have been shown to improve water retention, reduce erosion, and promote biodiversity.

### Climate Adaptation Strategies in the Indus Watershed

Climate adaptation is critical for ensuring food security and economic stability in the region. Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems offer a promising solution by:

* Improving soil health through agroforestry practices
* Enhancing water retention and reducing erosion
* Providing clean energy through micro-hydro systems
* Promoting biodiversity and ecosystem services

## Pilot Projects and Economic Analysis

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems in improving water security, promoting renewable energy adoption, and enhancing climate resilience. Economic analysis highlights the cost-effectiveness of these solutions.

### Key Data Points Needed

1. **Average Annual Rainfall in Selected Regions** (e.g., Pakistan, India) [verify]
2. **Specific Water Loss Percentages from Existing Irrigation Systems** [verify]
3. **Cost Estimates and Financial Viability Analysis for Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Projects**
