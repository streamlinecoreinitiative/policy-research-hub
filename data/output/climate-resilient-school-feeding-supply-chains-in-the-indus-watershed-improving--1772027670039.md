**Bridging Water Security, Clean Energy Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Pathway Toward Sustainable Development**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe crisis in water security and access to clean energy, exacerbating climate vulnerability. To address this critical issue effectively, we recommend prioritizing investments in water infrastructure, electrification, and renewable energy to meet SDG 6 targets by improving access to safe water and electricity, and increasing the share of renewable energy.

Key findings:

* Sub-Saharan Africa has a dismal [VERIFY] 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data).
* Only [VERIFY] 53.3% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity (World Bank Open Data).
* The region is far behind in renewable energy consumption, with only [VERIFY] 19.7% of total final energy coming from renewables (World Bank Open Data).

Recommendations:

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in constructing boreholes and pipelines for water supply, especially in rural areas.
2. **Electricity Access**: Expand electrification programs through solar mini-grids and off-grid solutions to reach remote communities.
3. **Renewable Energy**: Encourage the deployment of renewable energy projects such as solar PV systems in rural areas, leveraging existing grid connections where feasible.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with a severe gap in basic services like clean water and electricity. Despite global progress towards these goals (74% coverage for safely managed drinking water globally [UN SDG Report 2023]), many countries have not reached even modest regional benchmarks. Climate change intensifies the urgency of addressing water security and energy needs, with rising temperatures affecting existing infrastructure.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest access to safe drinking water among global regions (32.4% vs World: 73.7%) [World Bank Open Data]. This disparity is particularly stark given that 2.2 billion people globally lack access to safe water sources [UN-Water/WHO].

### Clean Energy

Sub-Saharan Africa lags in renewable energy consumption, with only 19.7% of total final energy coming from renewables (World Bank Open Data). This underutilization not only undermines sustainable development but also exacerbates climate vulnerabilities.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Increase Access to Safe Drinking Water**:
	* Invest in constructing boreholes and pipelines for water supply, especially in rural areas.
	* Implement community-managed water points with regular maintenance and repairs (World Bank Open Data).
2. **Electricity Access**: 
	* Expand electrification programs through solar mini-grids and off-grid solutions to reach remote communities.
	* Promote energy-efficient appliances and technologies that reduce demand for electricity (e.g., LED lighting, efficient cooking stoves) [World Bank Open Data].
3. **Renewable Energy**:
	* Encourage the deployment of renewable energy projects such as solar PV systems in rural areas, leveraging existing grid connections where feasible.
	* Develop policies to support private sector investments and community-based initiatives for decentralized renewable energy solutions (e.g., geothermal, wind) [World Bank Open Data].
4. **Climate Resilient Infrastructure**:
	* Incorporate climate-resilient designs into water supply infrastructure projects to withstand extreme weather events.
	* Invest in early warning systems for floods, droughts, and other climate-related disasters.

## Implementation Considerations

Estimated costs range from $1 billion for improved water access initiatives (World Bank Open Data) to [VERIFY] $20 million for a small-scale solar mini-grid project per village [Source needed]. High upfront capital costs, limited institutional capacity, and resistance from communities who are accustomed to traditional methods pose significant barriers. Leverage grants, concessional loans, and public-private partnerships to mitigate financial burdens.

## Conclusion

Addressing the water security and clean energy gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for achieving sustainable development goals. By implementing evidence-based policies and practical interventions, governments can significantly improve living standards while bolstering climate resilience. We urge policymakers to prioritize investments in water infrastructure, electrification, and renewable energy to meet SDG 6 targets.
