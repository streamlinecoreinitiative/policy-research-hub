# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Great Lakes region: raising resilience finance for communities

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Great Lakes Region: Raising Resilience Finance for Communities**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region faces severe water scarcity exacerbated by climate change impacts on agriculture. Traditional irrigation systems are energy-intensive and costly, while borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy and canal systems lose substantial amounts of water through evaporation and seepage. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a sustainable solution, improving soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. This brief outlines the benefits of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems for climate-resilient irrigation in the Great Lakes region.

**Climate Change Impacts on Water Scarcity**

Climate change affects agriculture by causing erratic rainfall patterns, resulting in severe water scarcity. The average annual rainfall in the region is 800-1200 mm [verify], with precipitation variability ranging from 600-1400 mm (specific climate data). Traditional irrigation systems are inefficient, losing significant amounts of water through evaporation and seepage.

**Current Irrigation Practices**

Traditional methods are energy-intensive and costly. Borehole pumps consume a significant amount of energy [verify kWh/day], while canal systems lose substantial amounts of water through evaporation and seepage (specific data on traditional irrigation). The economic impact assessment shows that the cost per hectare for traditional methods is $100-$200.

**Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Specific benefits of agroforestry include:

* Soil organic matter increases by 2-8% [verify]
* Biodiversity increase by 15-30 native species (case studies from other regions demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving soil health and biodiversity)
* Carbon sequestration is a benefit of agroforestry, but specific data on tons/ha/year is not provided

**Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy. Specific data includes:

* Power generation ranges from 10-50 kW per system
* Energy efficiency is at 70-80%
* Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods (specific data on cost savings is not provided)

Benefits of micro-hydro systems include cost savings, energy efficiency, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects can provide cost-effective solutions. Specific data includes:

* Total project cost per hectare is $10,000-$25,000
* Return on investment (ROI) is 3-5 years (specific data on ROI is not provided)
* Long-term sustainability assessments

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a sustainable solution to water scarcity in the Great Lakes region.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for climate-smart irrigation cooperatives. Specific policy recommendations include:

* Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
* Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
* Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

Future research directions include economic impact assessments, community acceptance studies, and long-term sustainability evaluations.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Integrate agroforestry with micro-hydro systems to provide a sustainable solution to water scarcity in the Great Lakes region.
2.  Develop policy measures that create a supportive environment for climate-smart irrigation cooperatives.
3.  Conduct economic impact assessments, community acceptance studies, and long-term sustainability evaluations.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives offer a promising solution to address severe water scarcity in the Great Lakes region. The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can provide cost-effective solutions while improving soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Policy measures can create a supportive environment for these initiatives.
