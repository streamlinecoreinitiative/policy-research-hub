# Executive Summary

**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: Strengthening Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, limited access to electricity, and escalating climate impacts in sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes renewable energy expansion, clean cooking solutions for urban areas, and climate-resilient infrastructure investments. By investing heavily in solar and wind energy projects, implementing pilot programs for clean cooking alternatives, and developing resilient water infrastructure, the region can bridge critical gaps while addressing regional disparities.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity, with only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024], compared to a global average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2024]. This disparity underscores the critical need for targeted interventions in the region. The limited electricity access (53.3%, [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2023]) exacerbates economic development and public health issues, while climate change intensifies droughts and floods, necessitating immediate adaptation strategies.

### Analysis

Evidence shows that renewable energy consumption in sub-Saharan Africa stands at 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2021], significantly lower than the global average of 19.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data, 2020]. This disparity underscores the region's underutilization of clean energy resources. Water security is a critical issue; with only 32.4% access to safely managed water, communities face severe health risks from contaminated drinking water sources. Climate adaptation efforts are still nascent in many countries, and the region experiences frequent droughts and floods, leading to food insecurity and displacement of populations.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Renewable Energy Expansion**: Invest heavily in solar and wind energy projects to increase renewable energy consumption to 25% by 2030.
	* Allocate dedicated funds from government budgets and international development partners to support renewable energy projects.

2. **Clean Cooking Solutions for Urban Areas**: Implement pilot programs to provide clean cooking alternatives like biogas stoves or electric stoves in peri-urban and urban centers, focusing on vulnerable populations.
	* Launch campaigns to educate communities on the benefits of clean water sources, safe cooking practices, and climate-resilient infrastructure.

3. **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Investments**: Develop resilient water infrastructure (e.g., flood barriers, irrigation systems) that can withstand climate impacts such as droughts and floods.
	* Train local engineers and community leaders in sustainable energy solutions and climate adaptation strategies.

### Implementation Considerations

1. Financial Constraints: Allocate dedicated funds from government budgets and international development partners to support renewable energy projects and clean cooking initiatives.
2. Public Awareness Campaigns: Launch campaigns to educate communities on the benefits of clean water sources, safe cooking practices, and climate-resilient infrastructure.
3. Capacity Building: Train local engineers and community leaders in sustainable energy solutions and climate adaptation strategies.

### Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa urgently needs targeted interventions to improve access to safe drinking water, electricity, and climate resilience. By implementing these recommendations, the region can lay a foundation for sustained economic growth and improved public health outcomes. Government officials, NGO leaders, and development practitioners must collaborate to make these solutions a reality within the next five years.
