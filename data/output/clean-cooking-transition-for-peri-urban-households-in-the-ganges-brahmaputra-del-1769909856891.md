**Strengthening Community Livelihoods Through Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To build a more resilient future for Sub-Saharan African communities, we recommend prioritizing investments in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation measures. Specifically, governments should:

• Invest in infrastructure projects that improve access to safe drinking water, aiming to increase coverage from 32.4% (World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1] to at least 50% within the next five years.
• Increase the share of electricity generated from renewables, targeting a minimum of 30% renewable energy consumption by 2030 (World Bank Open Data, 2020).
• Implement climate adaptation measures, such as early warning systems for droughts and floods, to enhance resilience against extreme weather events.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing basic services like clean water and reliable energy. The region's population has limited access to safe drinking water (32.4%, World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1], with millions of people lacking access to electricity (53.3%, World Bank Open Data, 2023). Climate change impacts, such as droughts and floods, are becoming more frequent and severe, exacerbating poverty levels and making communities more vulnerable.

## Analysis

Recent data highlights the urgency of addressing these challenges:

• Access to safely managed drinking water is significantly lower in Sub-Saharan Africa (32.4%, World Bank Open Data, 2024) [1] compared to the global average (73.7%, World Bank Open Data, 2024).
• Renewable energy consumption is relatively low globally (19.7%, World Bank Open Data, 2020), with less than half of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa having access to electricity (53.3%, World Bank Open Data, 2023).

## Policy Recommendations

To address these challenges, we recommend:

1. **Invest in water infrastructure projects**:
	* Develop and implement cost-effective solutions for water treatment and distribution systems.
	* Allocate more funds towards rural areas where access is least available, ensuring equitable coverage.
2. **Expand renewable energy sources**:
	* Increase the share of electricity from renewables by promoting policies that support solar, wind, and hydro projects.
	* Provide incentives for private sector investment in clean energy technologies tailored to local contexts.
3. **Enhance climate adaptation measures**:
	* Implement early warning systems for droughts and floods.
	* Develop contingency plans for water resources management during extreme weather events.

## Implementation Considerations

Addressing these challenges will require significant investments, but the long-term benefits are substantial:

• Improved health outcomes due to increased access to safe drinking water [2].
• Reduced economic losses from power outages and enhanced food security [3].
• Enhanced resilience against climate-related shocks.

Potential barriers include political resistance to new infrastructure projects, financial constraints for implementing climate adaptation measures, and lack of awareness about the importance of clean water and renewable energy. Addressing these challenges will require engagement with stakeholders at all levels (government, NGOs, private sector) to foster collaboration and resource mobilization.

## Conclusion

Building a more resilient future for Sub-Saharan African communities requires prioritizing investments in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation measures. We urge decision-makers to take immediate action by implementing these policy recommendations, which will not only improve the lives of millions but also contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
