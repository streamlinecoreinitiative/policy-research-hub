**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Great Lakes Region: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

The Great Lakes region is vulnerable to droughts, which can significantly impact food security for smallholder farmers. This brief highlights the importance of urban heat mitigation through cool roofs as a critical component of climate resilience strategies. By reducing the urban heat island effect and mitigating the impacts of extreme temperatures, cool roofs can help stabilize food security during droughts.

**Climate Vulnerability in the Great Lakes Region**

The Great Lakes region is characterized by a continental climate with cold winters and warm summers. However, climate change has led to increased frequency and severity of droughts, which can have devastating effects on agriculture. The region's agricultural sector relies heavily on rainfall, and droughts can lead to crop failures, reduced yields, and decreased food security.

**Current Smallholder Insurance Market Analysis**

Currently, there are limited insurance products available for smallholder farmers in the Great Lakes region. Existing insurance products often focus on crop-specific risks such as pests and diseases, but do not adequately address drought-related risks. As a result, smallholder farmers remain exposed to significant financial instability during droughts.

**Micro-insurance Scheme Design**

A micro-insurance scheme specifically designed for drought risk mitigation among smallholder farmers in the Great Lakes region is essential for enhancing climate resilience. The proposed scheme would provide coverage limits of up to $1,000 per farmer, with premiums structured as a percentage of farm income. Payout mechanisms would be triggered when rainfall levels fall below 50% of historical averages, ensuring that farmers receive support during times of need.

**Rationale Behind Insurance Coverage**

The proposed micro-insurance scheme is critical for climate resilience in the Great Lakes region due to several factors:

* Crop sensitivity: Many crops grown in the region are highly sensitive to drought, making them vulnerable to crop failures.
* Farmer income levels: Smallholder farmers in the region often operate on thin margins, making it difficult for them to absorb financial shocks during droughts.
* Market dynamics: The regional market is characterized by limited access to credit and insurance services, exacerbating the vulnerability of smallholder farmers.

**Implementation and Evaluation**

Implementing the micro-insurance scheme would require partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and insurance providers. Key steps include:

* Conducting a thorough needs assessment to determine the scope and scale of the scheme.
* Establishing a robust payout mechanism to ensure timely support for farmers during droughts.
* Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the scheme through regular surveys and impact assessments.

**Key Data Points Needed**

To develop an effective micro-insurance scheme, several key data points are needed:

* Historical rainfall data
* Current agricultural practices in the region
* Farmer income levels
* Existing climate risk management strategies

**Data Gaps**

The following data gaps need to be addressed:

* Detailed local climate patterns and variability data for the Great Lakes region.
* Information on current insurance products available for smallholder farmers in the region.
* Insights into farmer willingness to pay for drought risk mitigation insurance.

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Conduct a thorough needs assessment to determine the scope and scale of the micro-insurance scheme.
2. Establish partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and insurance providers to implement the scheme.
3. Develop a robust payout mechanism to ensure timely support for farmers during droughts.
4. Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme through regular surveys and impact assessments.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed micro-insurance scheme is a critical component of climate resilience strategies in the Great Lakes region. By providing immediate economic support and securing livelihoods, this scheme can help stabilize food security during droughts. Addressing data gaps and implementing the scheme will require collaborative efforts from local governments, NGOs, insurance providers, and other stakeholders.
