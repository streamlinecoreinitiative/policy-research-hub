**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Lower Mekong Delta: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

The Lower Mekong delta is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing frequent heatwaves and water scarcity. This brief explores the potential of cool roofs as a cost-effective solution for urban heat mitigation, improving health outcomes in heatwaves.

**Current Situation: Water Scarcity and Heatwaves**

The Lower Mekong delta faces severe water scarcity due to erratic rainfall patterns, affecting agriculture and human settlements. Average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm [verify]. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, consuming significant amounts of energy through borehole pumps.

**Cool Roofs as a Solution for Urban Heat Mitigation**

Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems can provide sustainable and renewable energy. Cool roof technology can be integrated with existing buildings, reducing surface temperatures and energy consumption. However, specific temperature reductions and energy savings are not supported by evidence in this brief.

**Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

The proposed solution integrates agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with cool roofs to address water security and clean energy needs. The total project cost per hectare is estimated at $10,000-$25,000 [verify], but a return on investment (ROI) of 3-5 years is not supported by evidence.

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with cool roofs, policy measures should be implemented to create a supportive environment. Subsidies for farmers can encourage the adoption of this technology, while grid integration with micro-hydro systems can enhance reliability and efficiency [verify].

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Conduct economic analyses of traditional irrigation costs and micro-hydro systems.
2. Develop long-term sustainability assessments of similar regions.
3. Implement policy measures to create a supportive environment for the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems with cool roofs.

**Closing Outlook**

The proposed solution has potential to improve health outcomes in heatwaves by reducing urban heat island effects and providing climate-resilient water supply. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this integrated solution, ensuring its adoption in the Lower Mekong delta region.
