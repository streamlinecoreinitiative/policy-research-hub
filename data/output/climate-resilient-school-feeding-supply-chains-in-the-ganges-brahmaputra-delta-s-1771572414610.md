# climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

### Executive Summary

Achieving climate resilience in school feeding supply chains is crucial for ensuring the well-being of children and communities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. With only 32.4% access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data) and 53.3% access to electricity (World Bank Open Data), the region faces significant challenges in providing basic necessities, let alone climate-resilient food systems. To address this, we recommend:

1. **Implementing policies for universal access to safe water**: Governments should invest in piped water connections in rural areas and encourage private sector investments through subsidies and incentives.
2. **Expanding electricity access**: Invest in renewable energy projects to increase the share of renewables in electricity generation from 19.7% (World Bank Open Data) to at least 30% by 2030, and provide affordable loans or grants for households to install clean cooking solutions.

### Context & Challenge

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most vulnerable regions globally to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise, increased flooding, and droughts. With a growing population relying on agriculture and fishing, the region's food systems are under significant pressure. Recent data shows that:

* 40% of sub-Saharan Africans rely on unsafe drinking water sources ([NEEDS SOURCE])
* The lack of electricity affects millions, hindering economic growth and quality of life.
* Climate change-induced variability in precipitation patterns exacerbates water scarcity.

### Analysis

Sub-Saharan Africa's water scarcity is a pressing issue. According to the World Bank Open Data, only 32.4% of the population has access to safe drinking water, compared to a global average of 73.7%. This disparity highlights the need for urgent action. Renewable energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa is also low at 19.7% (World Bank Open Data), hindering economic development and increasing vulnerability during climate shocks.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Universal Safe Water Access**
	* Governments should prioritize investments in piped water connections in rural areas.
	* Encourage private sector investments through subsidies and incentives, especially in off-grid settings.
2. **Electricity Access Expansion**
	* Invest in renewable energy projects to increase the share of renewables in electricity generation from 19.7% (World Bank Open Data) to at least 30% by 2030.
	* Provide affordable loans or grants for households and small businesses to install clean cooking solutions, reducing reliance on kerosene lamps and improving air quality.
3. **Renewable Energy Integration**
	* Develop comprehensive solar energy plans that integrate with existing power grids and support decentralized renewable energy systems in remote areas.
	* Promote community-led initiatives for climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as agroforestry value chains, to enhance food security and adapt to changing weather patterns.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations will require significant investment. Estimated costs of expanding access to safe water could range from $20-$30 billion over the next decade ([NEEDS SOURCE]). However, investing in renewable energy infrastructure requires substantial upfront capital but yields long-term benefits.

### Conclusion

Achieving climate resilience in school feeding supply chains is critical for ensuring the well-being of children and communities in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. By taking swift action on these recommendations, governments and partners can pave a path toward resilient communities better equipped to face future challenges.

**Call to Action**: Leaders should prioritize investments in these areas by allocating appropriate resources and fostering collaborative efforts among stakeholders. This commitment will not only improve living standards but also contribute significantly to achieving global development goals.
