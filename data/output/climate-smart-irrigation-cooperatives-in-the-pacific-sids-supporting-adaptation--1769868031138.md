# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

## Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to strengthen environmental resilience in lower-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, through improved water security and clean energy access. We recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives as a key strategy for supporting adaptation targets outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These cooperatives can enhance water management efficiency, promote renewable energy adoption, and foster community-led initiatives that boost resilience against climate-induced disruptions.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe drinking water and reliable electricity. According to the World Bank Open Data, only 32.4% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank Open Data, 2024), while 53.3% rely on electricity (World Bank Open Data, 2023). These disparities underscore critical needs for targeted interventions that enhance resilience against climate stressors.

## Analysis

Recent data underscores the urgency of addressing these challenges:

*   **Water Access**: Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has access to safely managed drinking water [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data, 2024), compared to a global average of 73.7% [Source: World Bank Open Data].
*   **Electricity Access**: While 91.6% of the world has access to electricity [Source: World Bank Open Data], this drops to 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa [Source: World Bank Open Data].
*   **Renewable Energy Consumption**: The region’s renewable energy consumption stands at just 19.7%, far below global averages [VERIFY] (World Bank Open Data, 2020).

These statistics reveal stark inequities that threaten economic stability and public health.

## Policy Recommendations

To bolster resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa:

1.  **Establish Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives**: Support community-led initiatives to develop and implement efficient irrigation systems powered by renewable energy sources.
2.  **Promote Renewable Energy Adoption**: Increase investment in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to meet growing electricity demands sustainably.
3.  **Enhance Water Management Efficiency**: Invest in clean water supply systems and sanitation facilities to improve access to safe drinking water.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing these recommendations requires careful planning:

*   **Costs and Budget Allocation**: Estimate the financial burden of infrastructure investments and ensure adequate funding mechanisms are in place.
*   **Technological Solutions**: Leverage existing technological advancements like solar-powered pumps for water extraction and community-based clean cooking solutions.
*   **Community Participation**: Engage local communities to ensure sustainability and equitable distribution of resources.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa must prioritize environmental resilience through improved water security and renewable energy adoption. By adopting evidence-based policy measures, the region can mitigate climate-induced risks and enhance long-term development prospects.
