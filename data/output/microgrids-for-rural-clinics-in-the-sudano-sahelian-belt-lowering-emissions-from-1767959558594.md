**Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity and energy insecurity. This brief explores the potential of microgrids for rural clinics in this region, highlighting their role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from critical sectors such as healthcare.

**Section 1: Water Scarcity and Climate Change Impacts**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is characterized by a semi-arid climate with erratic rainfall patterns causing significant water scarcity. [Verify] Average annual rainfall ranges from 800-1200 mm, with precipitation variability reaching up to 600-1400 mm (NOAA climate dataset). Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, consuming between 10-20 kWh/day per borehole pump.

**Section 2: Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Studies demonstrate increases in soil organic matter by [verify]%, biodiversity by [verify]% native species, and carbon sequestration by [verify] tons/ha/year (local surveys and case studies). Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can create a climate-resilient water supply while reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

**Section 3: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy, generating between [verify] kW per system. Compared to traditional irrigation methods, micro-hydro systems offer significant cost savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Economic analysis is needed to determine the total project cost per hectare and return on investment (ROI).

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. **Policy Support**: Governments and international organizations should provide subsidies for farmers to encourage adoption of agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
2. **Grid Integration**: Micro-hydro systems should be integrated into the grid to enhance reliability and efficiency.
3. **Infrastructure Development**: Roads, storage facilities, and other infrastructure improvements should be made to support the implementation of microgrids.

**Closing Outlook**

The integration of agroforestry with micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for addressing water scarcity and energy insecurity in rural clinics across the Sudano-Sahelian belt. Further research is needed to assess the long-term sustainability of these interventions and inform policy decisions that support their adoption.
