# Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Andean Highlands: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The clean cooking transition is crucial for peri-urban households in the Andean highlands, where traditional biomass-based cooking methods contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and indoor air pollution. This brief highlights the importance of transitioning to cleaner cooking practices, focusing on the integration of renewable energy sources and climate-resilient infrastructure.

## Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation

### Introduction to Water Scarcity in Peri-Urban Areas of the Andean Highlands

The Andean highlands face severe water scarcity due to climate change impacts, including erratic rainfall patterns. This has significant implications for food security, economic stability, and human well-being.

*   **Climate Change Impacts:**
    *   Erratic rainfall patterns
    *   Increased evaporation rates
    *   Decreased water retention in soil

### Current Energy and Water Practices in Peri-Urban Areas of the Andean Highlands

Peri-urban households rely heavily on traditional biomass-based cooking methods, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and indoor air pollution.

*   **Energy Consumption:**
    *   Biomass-based cooking methods (e.g., charcoal, firewood)
    *   Limited access to clean energy sources
*   **Water Scarcity:**
    *   Inadequate water supply infrastructure
    *   High water loss through evaporation and seepage

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices can help mitigate the effects of climate change by improving soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improved soil fertility
    *   Enhanced water retention
    *   Increased crop yields

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Clean Energy Generation

Micro-hydro systems offer a viable solution for clean energy generation in peri-urban areas of the Andean highlands.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Reduced reliance on diesel generators
    *   Increased energy efficiency
    *   Improved air quality

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro Systems for Climate-Resilient Water Supply

The integration of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems can provide a sustainable solution for climate-resilient water supply in peri-urban areas.

*   **Pilot Projects:**
    *   Demonstration of combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro
    *   Economic analysis showing cost-effectiveness

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of clean cooking practices, policy recommendations include:

1.  **Renewable Energy Targets:** Establish renewable energy targets for peri-urban areas in NDCs.
2.  **Clean Cooking Incentives:** Provide incentives for households to transition to cleaner cooking methods.
3.  **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure:** Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, including micro-hydro systems and agroforestry practices.

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  Conduct a comprehensive assessment of water scarcity and energy consumption in peri-urban areas of the Andean highlands.
2.  Develop a roadmap for transitioning to cleaner cooking practices, integrating renewable energy sources and climate-resilient infrastructure.
3.  Establish partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and community organizations to support the adoption of clean cooking practices.

## Closing Outlook

The transition to clean cooking practices is crucial for peri-urban households in the Andean highlands. By supporting adaptation targets in NDCs, this transition can help reduce emissions, improve public health, and enhance economic stability.
