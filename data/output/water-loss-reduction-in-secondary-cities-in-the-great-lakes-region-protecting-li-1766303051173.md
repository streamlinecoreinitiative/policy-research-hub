# Water Loss Reduction in Secondary Cities in the Great Lakes Region: Protecting Livelihoods under Climate Stress

## Executive Summary

The Great Lakes region faces significant challenges related to water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation. This brief highlights the importance of addressing these issues through integrated approaches that prioritize environmental resilience.

## Environmental Resilience in Lower-Income Countries

Climate change exacerbates water scarcity and energy insecurity in lower-income countries, including those in the Great Lakes region. Traditional irrigation methods are often energy-intensive and costly, perpetuating poverty among smallholder farmers. Agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems offer a sustainable solution that can enhance both water security and renewable energy use.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

*   **Rationale:** Traditional irrigation methods exacerbate poverty among smallholder farmers due to their energy intensity and high costs.
*   **Specific data on traditional irrigation:**
    *   Borehole pumps consume [verify] kWh/day of energy
    *   Canal systems experience water loss through evaporation (30%) and seepage (5%)
*   **Economic impact assessment:**
    *   Cost per hectare for traditional irrigation methods: $100-$200/year

### Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making it more resilient to climate change impacts.

*   **Benefits of agroforestry:**
    *   Soil organic matter: 2-8%
    *   Biodiversity: 15-30% increase in native species
    *   Carbon sequestration: [verify] tons/ha/year

### Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro systems provide sustainable and renewable energy for irrigation, reducing reliance on diesel generators.

*   **Specific data:**
    *   Power generation: 10-50 kW per system
    *   Energy efficiency: 70-80%
    *   Cost savings compared to traditional irrigation methods

### Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Integrated systems can provide cost-effective solutions that demonstrate feasibility and potential for scaling up.

*   **Cost estimates and financial viability analysis:**
    *   Total project cost: $10,000-$25,000 per hectare
    *   Return on investment (ROI): 3-5 years
    *   Long-term sustainability assessments

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

Policy measures can create a supportive environment for implementing sustainable irrigation solutions, while future research is needed to validate long-term impacts and sustainability.

*   **Policy recommendations:**
    *   Incentives for farmers (e.g., subsidies, low-interest loans)
    *   Grid integration with micro-hydro systems
    *   Infrastructure development (roads, storage facilities)

## Actions/Recommendations

1.  **Develop a comprehensive policy framework** that supports the adoption of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems in secondary cities.
2.  **Conduct thorough economic analyses** to determine the cost-effectiveness and financial viability of integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro projects.
3.  **Establish partnerships with local communities**, farmers, and relevant stakeholders to ensure community acceptance and benefits from these initiatives.

## Closing Outlook

Addressing water loss reduction in secondary cities in the Great Lakes region requires a multi-faceted approach that integrates environmental resilience strategies. By prioritizing agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems, we can enhance both water security and renewable energy use, ultimately protecting livelihoods under climate stress.
