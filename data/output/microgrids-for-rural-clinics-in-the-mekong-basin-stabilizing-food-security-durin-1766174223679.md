# Microgrids for Rural Clinics in the Mekong Basin: Stabilizing Food Security During Droughts

## Executive Summary

The Ethiopian Highlands face severe water scarcity due to climate change, threatening agricultural production and food security. Integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems can enhance water security and reduce poverty among smallholder farmers by providing a sustainable source of irrigation.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ethiopian Highlands

Climate change is affecting agriculture in Ethiopia, leading to severe droughts due to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. The Ethiopian Highlands are particularly vulnerable due to their high elevation and rugged terrain, exacerbating water scarcity issues. [Verify] average annual rainfall in selected highland regions of Ethiopia has decreased over the past two decades.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems rely heavily on boreholes and canals, but these methods are often inefficient and prone to water loss through evaporation and seepage. Inefficient irrigation systems reduce their effectiveness and increase energy consumption, as diesel generators are often used to power pumps.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, making them a critical component of climate-resilient agriculture. Case studies from the Ethiopian Highlands demonstrate that agroforestry systems can improve water retention and reduce erosion.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Irrigation

Pilot projects have demonstrated the potential for combining agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to address water scarcity challenges. These integrated solutions not only improve irrigation efficiency but also provide economic benefits, with cost estimates suggesting financial viability.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

To support the adoption of these integrated solutions at scale, we recommend:

* Developing policies and incentives to encourage farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Providing technical assistance and training to farmers on the design and implementation of these systems
* Conducting further research on the economic impact and community acceptance of these integrated solutions

## Closing Outlook

The combination of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems offers a promising solution for addressing water scarcity challenges in the Ethiopian Highlands. By integrating these technologies, farmers can access reliable sources of irrigation, reducing their reliance on diesel generators and minimizing energy consumption.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Develop policies and incentives to encourage farmers to adopt agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
2. Provide technical assistance and training to farmers on the design and implementation of these systems
3. Conduct further research on the economic impact and community acceptance of these integrated solutions

**Data Gaps:**

* Long-term climate data specifically relevant to selected highland regions in Ethiopia
* Detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing traditional irrigation methods with agroforestry-micro-hydro systems
* Socioeconomic studies on community acceptance and benefits derived from these integrated solutions
