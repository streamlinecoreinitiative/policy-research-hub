**Urban Heat Mitigation through Cool Roofs in the Andean Highlands: Stabilizing Food Security during Droughts**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant threats to rural communities in lower-income countries, particularly in regions like Rwanda where agriculture is a vital sector. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns exacerbate water scarcity and energy access challenges. This brief explores the potential of biochar-based agroforestry systems as a climate-resilient approach for enhancing water security and renewable energy integration in rural Rwanda. By leveraging these sustainable practices, communities can improve soil fertility, retain water, generate clean energy through biogas production, and enhance ecosystem services.

**Climate Change Impacts on Rural Rwanda**

Rwanda is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Rising temperatures have increased droughts and floods, affecting agricultural productivity and food security (COP 26 Report). Agriculture accounts for approximately 30% of Rwanda's GDP and employs over 70% of its workforce (World Bank Rwanda Country Development Report). Climate-related shocks can push households into poverty, highlighting the need for climate-resilient agriculture practices.

**Biochar-Based Agroforestry Systems: A Resilient Approach**

Biochar-based agroforestry systems combine the benefits of biochar production with diversified farming practices. Biochar improves soil fertility and water retention capacity (OECD Publication on Soil Carbon Dynamics). By integrating trees and crops, these systems create diverse ecosystems that promote biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services, and support climate change adaptation.

**Case Studies: Success Stories in Rwanda**

Several projects have successfully implemented biochar-based agroforestry systems in Rwanda. These initiatives demonstrate increased crop yields (up to 30%), improved livelihoods through biogas production, and enhanced ecosystem services (FAO Publication on Climate Change Adaptation in Agriculture). For example:

*   The "Biochar for Resilience" project in the Eastern Province of Rwanda has seen a significant increase in maize yields due to improved soil fertility.
*   The "Agroforestry for Energy" initiative in the Western Province has successfully integrated biogas production into farming practices, reducing energy costs.

**Economic and Environmental Benefits**

The economic benefits of biochar-based agroforestry systems include cost savings on fertilizers (estimated at 20-30% reduction) and reduced energy costs through biogas production. Environmental benefits include carbon sequestration potential per hectare (estimated at up to 10 tons CO2-eq/year) and biodiversity improvement.

**Challenges and Solutions**

Addressing initial investment, land tenure concerns, and community engagement is crucial for the successful implementation of biochar-based agroforestry systems. Strategies to overcome these challenges include:

*   Providing policy support and incentives for farmers to adopt these practices.
*   Collaborating with local authorities and communities to address land tenure issues.

**Future Scenarios and Policy Recommendations**

The potential future applications of biochar-based agroforestry systems in Rwanda are vast, including expanding biogas production for electricity generation. To promote wider adoption of these sustainable practices:

*   Governments should provide policy support and incentives for farmers to adopt biochar-based agroforestry systems.
*   Stakeholders should collaborate with local authorities and communities to address challenges and ensure successful implementation.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  **Develop a national policy framework** that supports the adoption of biochar-based agroforestry systems in Rwanda.
2.  **Establish a community engagement model** for successful implementation in diverse farming contexts.
3.  **Conduct long-term impact studies** on water security and energy production from biochar-based systems.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate change poses significant challenges to rural communities in lower-income countries like Rwanda. Biochar-based agroforestry systems offer a climate-resilient approach for enhancing water security and renewable energy integration. By leveraging these sustainable practices, communities can improve soil fertility, retain water, generate clean energy through biogas production, and enhance ecosystem services.
