**Securing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $[VERIFY] billion over five years in climate-resilient infrastructure for water security and clean energy generation. This investment will help increase access to safe drinking water, promote renewable energy consumption, and enhance climate adaptation measures. Furthermore, we urge governments and international organizations to increase climate finance to $5.8-5.9 trillion annually by 2030 to support adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts, with frequent droughts and floods affecting millions of people (IPCC AR6). Climate change exacerbates existing water scarcity issues, leading to food insecurity and economic instability. Without urgent action, these challenges will continue to threaten the region's sustainable development goals.

According to UN-Water/WHO, 2.2 billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to safely managed water sources (UN-Water/WHO). The region has made limited progress in renewable energy consumption, sitting at just [VERIFY]% of total energy production (World Bank Open Data), far below the global average of 19.7% (World Bank Open Data). Climate adaptation is also a significant challenge, with less than half of countries having national adaptation plans.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Access to safely managed water sources is critical for human health and well-being. According to UN-Water/WHO, 2.2 billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to safely managed water sources (UN-Water/WHO). Investing in desalination plants and water storage facilities can help increase access to safe drinking water.

### Clean Energy Access

Renewable energy consumption is essential for reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. The region has made limited progress in renewable energy consumption, sitting at just [VERIFY]% of total energy production (World Bank Open Data). Increasing the share of renewable energy consumption by at least 50% within five years through subsidies, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships can help reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

### Climate Adaptation

Climate adaptation is critical for building resilience to extreme weather events. Developing early warning systems for extreme weather events using satellite imagery and local data sources can help save lives and prevent damage to infrastructure. Promoting climate-resilient agriculture practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties and improved irrigation techniques can also help farmers adapt to changing climate conditions.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Invest $[VERIFY] billion over five years in climate-resilient infrastructure for water security and clean energy generation.
2. **Increase Renewable Energy Consumption**: Increase the share of renewable energy consumption by at least 50% within five years through subsidies, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships.
3. **Develop Early Warning Systems**: Develop early warning systems for extreme weather events using satellite imagery and local data sources.
4. **Promote Climate-Resilient Agriculture Practices**: Promote climate-resilient agriculture practices such as drought-resistant crop varieties and improved irrigation techniques.

## Implementation Considerations

Establishing dedicated funding mechanisms to support these initiatives, leveraging existing development funds like the Global Environment Facility (GEF), can help ensure the success of these efforts. Engaging local communities in decision-making processes related to climate adaptation projects is also essential for building trust and ensuring that projects meet community needs.

## Conclusion

Securing water security, clean energy access, and climate adaptation measures are critical for sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. We urge governments, international organizations, and development partners to prioritize these efforts immediately. Investing $[VERIFY] billion over five years in climate-resilient infrastructure and increasing climate finance to $5.8-5.9 trillion annually by 2030 can help ensure the region's sustainable development goals while mitigating climate change impacts.
