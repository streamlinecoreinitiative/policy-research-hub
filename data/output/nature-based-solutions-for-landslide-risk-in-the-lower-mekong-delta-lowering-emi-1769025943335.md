**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity, energy poverty, and climate change impacts, exacerbating vulnerability to droughts and floods. To address these pressing issues, we recommend prioritizing universal electrification, expanding renewable energy adoption, and implementing sustainable water management practices. By doing so, decision-makers can foster sustainable development, improve public health outcomes, and boost economic productivity.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa struggles with limited infrastructure, including unreliable power supply and inadequate access to safe drinking water sources (World Bank Open Data, 2023). Climate variability threatens already fragile ecosystems, leading to more frequent droughts and floods affecting millions of people's livelihoods and health. The region's water scarcity and energy poverty exacerbate climate vulnerability; climate change-induced extreme weather events compound existing infrastructure weaknesses.

- **Access to safely managed drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa is only 32.4% (World Bank Open Data, 2024)**.
- **Electricity access rates are also low at [VERIFY]%, with rural areas particularly underserved (World Bank Open Data, 2023)**.

## Analysis

The region's poor water quality and limited electricity contribute to higher disease prevalence and economic losses due to frequent power outages affecting critical services like healthcare facilities. Over 2.2 billion people globally lack access to safe drinking water (UN-Water/WHO, 2022), with Sub-Saharan Africa being one of the most affected regions.

- **Sub-Saharan Africa’s renewable energy consumption is only [VERIFY]% of total final energy consumption (World Bank Open Data, 2020)**.
- **Climate change-induced extreme weather events compound existing infrastructure weaknesses** [NEEDS SOURCE].

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Universal Electrification**: Implement electrification programs in rural areas to ensure access to electricity for all households within the next five years.
2. **Renewable Energy Adoption**: Encourage and invest in renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions by 30% within the next decade.
3. **Sustainable Water Management**: Promote water harvesting, watershed management, and sustainable irrigation systems to improve water security and protect vital ecosystems.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments may be high but payoffs in terms of improved health outcomes, economic productivity, and long-term sustainability are significant. Limited financing, regulatory hurdles, and community resistance can impede implementation. Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities is crucial for success.

## Conclusion

Decision-makers must prioritize these interventions as part of broader climate adaptation strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa. By doing so, they can build more resilient communities that are better equipped to withstand future environmental shocks. Developing detailed implementation plans with specific timelines and resource allocation is essential for success.
