**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Caribbean SIDS: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity issues in rural areas of the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), particularly during heatwaves, which pose significant health risks. Traditional water supply systems are often inefficient and unsustainable. Micro-hydro turbines offer a sustainable solution by harnessing local hydro resources to provide renewable energy and potable water simultaneously. This brief highlights the potential of micro-hydro turbines in improving climate resilience and livelihoods in the Caribbean SIDS.

**Climate Change Impacts in the Caribbean SIDS**

The Caribbean SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate change due to their geographical location, with rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, and altered precipitation patterns posing significant threats. Heatwaves, which have become more frequent and severe, pose substantial health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children.

*   Rising temperatures increase water evaporation, exacerbating water scarcity issues.
*   Changes in precipitation patterns lead to droughts or floods, further straining traditional water supply systems.
*   Increased storm intensity poses significant threats to infrastructure and human life.

**Micro-Hydro Turbines: A Sustainable Solution**

Micro-hydro turbines offer a sustainable solution by harnessing local hydro resources to provide renewable energy and potable water simultaneously. This approach has several benefits:

*   **Renewable Energy**: Micro-hydro turbines generate electricity from flowing water, reducing dependence on imported fuels.
*   **Water Supply**: The same system can be used for irrigation, drinking water, or other non-potable purposes.
*   **Climate Resilience**: By harnessing local hydro resources, micro-hydro turbines reduce the impact of climate-related extremes.

**Implementation and Policy Recommendations**

Successful implementation of micro-hydro turbines requires careful planning and stakeholder engagement. Key recommendations include:

1.  Conduct thorough feasibility studies to assess hydro resource availability and potential.
2.  Engage with local communities and traditional authorities in decision-making processes.
3.  Develop policy measures to support adoption, such as subsidies or regulatory frameworks.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

*   Conduct a comprehensive review of existing water supply systems and climate change impacts in the Caribbean SIDS.
*   Develop a roadmap for implementing micro-hydro turbines in priority areas.
*   Establish partnerships with international organizations and local stakeholders to facilitate knowledge sharing and resource mobilization.

**Closing Outlook**

The implementation of micro-hydro turbines offers a promising solution to address water scarcity issues and improve climate resilience in the Caribbean SIDS. By harnessing local hydro resources, these systems can provide renewable energy and potable water simultaneously, reducing dependence on imported fuels and improving livelihoods. Effective policy measures and stakeholder engagement are critical for successful implementation.

**Key Data Points Needed:**

*   Annual rainfall variability data in the Caribbean SIDS.
*   Historical flood and drought frequency and intensity trends over the last decade.
*   Cost breakdowns for micro-hydro turbine installation and maintenance.
*   Success rates of implemented projects and lessons learned from them.
