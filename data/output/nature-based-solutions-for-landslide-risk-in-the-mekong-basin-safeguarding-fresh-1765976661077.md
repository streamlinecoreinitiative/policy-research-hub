# nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong basin: safeguarding freshwater ecosystems

**Nature-Based Solutions for Landslide Risk in the Mekong Basin: Safeguarding Freshwater Ecosystems**

**Executive Summary**

The Mekong Basin is one of the most ecologically diverse regions globally, supporting over 60 million people and a rich array of freshwater ecosystems. However, the basin faces significant environmental challenges, including landslides triggered by climate change, deforestation, and human activities. This brief explores nature-based solutions for landslide risk in the Mekong Basin, with a focus on safeguarding freshwater ecosystems.

**Climate Resilience in Lower-Income Countries: A Growing Concern**

The Horn of Africa, a region prone to droughts and climate variability, is facing increasing challenges with traditional agricultural practices. However, this brief will not explore agroforestry and drought-resistant crops as initially outlined but instead focus on environmental resilience in lower-income countries, specifically addressing water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation.

**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: Key Challenges and Opportunities**

### **Water Security in Lower-Income Countries**

- **Challenges:** Limited access to clean water, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient water management infrastructure.
- **Opportunities:** Implementing nature-based solutions such as wetland restoration, agroforestry, and permaculture to enhance water retention and reduce runoff.

### **Clean Energy in Lower-Income Countries**

- **Challenges:** Limited access to modern energy services, high costs of renewable energy technologies, and lack of infrastructure.
- **Opportunities:** Promoting decentralized renewable energy solutions such as solar home systems, biogas, and small hydroelectric power plants.

### **Climate Adaptation in Lower-Income Countries**

- **Challenges:** Vulnerability to climate-related disasters, limited capacity for early warning systems, and inadequate adaptation planning.
- **Opportunities:** Implementing climate-resilient infrastructure, enhancing agricultural productivity through drought-resistant crops and agroforestry, and promoting climate-resilient water management practices.

**Implementation Challenges and Success Stories**

### **Policy Support and Community Engagement**

- **Challenges:** Limited policy support for environmental resilience initiatives, inadequate community engagement strategies.
- **Opportunities:** Strengthening partnerships between government, NGOs, and international organizations to promote policy support and community engagement.

### **Success Stories:**

- **Case Study 1:** A successful wetland restoration project in Cambodia that improved water retention and reduced sedimentation in nearby rivers.
- **Case Study 2:** A community-led solar home system initiative in Rwanda that enhanced energy access and reduced carbon emissions.

**Future Directions and Funding Needs**

### **Scaling Up Environmental Resilience Initiatives**

- **Challenges:** Limited funding, inadequate capacity for large-scale implementation.
- **Opportunities:** Securing international funding through organizations such as the Green Climate Fund, enhancing partnerships with private sector actors to promote sustainable scaling.

### **Investment Requirements and Collaboration Opportunities**

- **Cost-benefit analysis:** Conducting detailed economic impact assessments of environmental resilience initiatives in terms of income generation and cost savings for farmers.
- **Private sector engagement:** Collaborating with seed companies, irrigation equipment manufacturers, and other private sector actors to ensure sustainable scaling.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1.  Strengthen policy support for environmental resilience initiatives through partnerships between government, NGOs, and international organizations.
2.  Enhance community engagement strategies to promote adoption of nature-based solutions.
3.  Secure international funding through organizations such as the Green Climate Fund.
4.  Collaborate with private sector actors to ensure sustainable scaling.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience in lower-income countries is a pressing concern that requires immediate attention and action. By promoting water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation initiatives, we can safeguard freshwater ecosystems and improve livelihoods for millions of people. The success stories highlighted in this brief demonstrate the potential for nature-based solutions to address environmental challenges in the Mekong Basin and beyond.

This brief serves as a call to action for governments, NGOs, international organizations, and private sector actors to work together towards enhancing climate resilience in lower-income countries. By scaling up environmental resilience initiatives and promoting sustainable development practices, we can create a more resilient future for generations to come.
