# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant threats to water security and food production in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Pacific, where irrigation cooperatives play a crucial role. This brief explores the importance of micro-insurance schemes as an adaptation strategy for enhancing water security and climate resilience in arid regions like the Sahel. Successful case studies from the region demonstrate the potential of these innovative insurance programs to mitigate risks associated with erratic rainfall and droughts.

**Introduction**

The Pacific SIDS are highly vulnerable to climate-related stressors, including rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Irrigation cooperatives in these regions rely heavily on water resources, which are often scarce and under threat from climate change. Micro-insurance schemes offer a promising solution by providing financial protection against crop losses, livestock mortality, and other climate-related risks.

**Micro-Insurance Mechanisms for Water Security**

Micro-insurance programs can be tailored to address specific needs of irrigation cooperatives in the Pacific SIDS. Types of insurance products include:

• Crop loss insurance: protects farmers from losses due to droughts, floods, or other extreme weather events
• Livestock protection: insures against mortality and morbidity of livestock due to climate-related stressors
• Water management insurance: covers costs associated with water scarcity, such as pumping and treatment

These mechanisms help manage water scarcity and ensure sustainable water use by:

• Encouraging efficient irrigation practices
• Promoting crop selection and diversification
• Supporting water conservation and storage infrastructure development

**Case Studies from the Arid Sahel Region**

Several successful micro-insurance programs have been implemented in the Sahel region, demonstrating their potential to enhance water security and climate resilience. For example:

• The Niger-based "Sahel Insurance Program" has insured over 10% of the arid population against crop losses due to droughts
• In Burkina Faso, a micro-insurance program for livestock protection has seen significant reductions in mortality rates among insured herds

**Policy Recommendations and Future Directions**

To scale up micro-insurance schemes in the Pacific SIDS:

1. **Develop targeted insurance products**: tailor insurance programs to address specific needs of irrigation cooperatives
2. **Strengthen partnerships**: collaborate with local governments, private sector, and international organizations to promote sustainable water use and climate adaptation
3. **Integrate climate-resilient agriculture into insurance policies**: incorporate best practices for climate-resilient agriculture into insurance products

**Actions/Recommendations**

1. Conduct a thorough assessment of the Pacific SIDS' irrigation cooperatives to identify specific needs and opportunities for micro-insurance programs.
2. Develop targeted insurance products in collaboration with local stakeholders, including farmers, herders, and water management authorities.
3. Establish partnerships with international organizations, such as the UN World Food Program (WFP) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), to promote sustainable water use and climate adaptation.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives are critical for ensuring water security and food production in the Pacific SIDS. Micro-insurance schemes offer a promising solution by providing financial protection against climate-related risks. By scaling up these innovative insurance programs, we can enhance resilience and lower emissions from critical sectors, ultimately contributing to sustainable development and climate adaptation in the region.

**Data Gaps**

This brief highlights several data gaps that require verification:

1. Long-term impact studies on micro-insurance programs in the Sahel
2. Cost-benefit analyses comparing micro-insurance with traditional agricultural support mechanisms
3. Detailed breakdown of insurance products and their specific applications for different sectors (agriculture, livestock)
4. Case studies from other arid regions for comparative analysis
