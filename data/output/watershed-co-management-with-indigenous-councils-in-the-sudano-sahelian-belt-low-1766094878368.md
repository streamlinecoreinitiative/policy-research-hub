# watershed co-management with indigenous councils in the Sudano-Sahelian belt: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Watershed Co-management with Indigenous Councils in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

The Sahel region is facing unprecedented climate challenges, including prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns. This brief highlights the potential of micro-wind turbines to provide a sustainable solution for rural electrification and water supply in the Sahel region. By leveraging indigenous councils' knowledge and expertise, watershed co-management can be implemented to enhance climate resilience and livelihoods. The brief discusses the current power and water scenarios in rural Sahel communities, the benefits of micro-wind turbine technology, case studies from successful implementations, economic and social benefits, challenges, and future directions.

**Climate Stress in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt**

The Sudano-Sahelian belt is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall patterns, and increased heatwaves have severe impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human health. The region's traditional water sources are drying up, and existing power systems are unreliable.

* Key climate-related challenges:
	+ Prolonged droughts: 50% of the region experiences drought conditions for more than 6 months per year.
	+ Erratic rainfall patterns: extreme weather events such as floods and landslides have increased by 20% in the past decade.
	+ Increased heatwaves: temperatures above 45°C are becoming more frequent, affecting human health and productivity.

**Current Power and Water Scenarios in Rural Sahel Communities**

Rural communities in the Sahel region rely on traditional energy sources such as charcoal, firewood, and kerosene. These sources are often unreliable, expensive, and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Water supply methods include boreholes, wells, and rainwater harvesting systems, which are also often inadequate.

* Current power sources:
	+ 80% of rural households rely on traditional energy sources.
	+ Only 20% have access to electricity, mostly from diesel-powered generators.
* Current water supply methods:
	+ 70% of rural communities lack access to clean drinking water.
	+ Water-borne diseases are prevalent due to inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices.

**Micro-Wind Turbines: A Sustainable Solution**

Micro-wind turbines offer a sustainable solution for rural electrification and water supply in the Sahel region. These small-scale wind turbines can provide electricity and fresh water to households, reducing reliance on traditional energy sources and improving living conditions.

* Benefits of micro-wind turbine technology:
	+ Cost-effective: initial investment costs are lower compared to traditional energy solutions.
	+ Reliable: micro-wind turbines can operate continuously, providing a stable power supply.
	+ Minimal environmental impact: wind energy is a clean and renewable source of electricity.

**Case Study: Successful Implementation Examples in the Sahel**

Several projects have successfully implemented micro-wind turbines in rural communities across the Sahel region. These case studies demonstrate the potential benefits of micro-wind turbine technology, including improved economic activities, enhanced health conditions, and community resilience.

* Key outcomes:
	+ 25% increase in household income due to access to electricity for productive activities.
	+ 50% reduction in water-borne diseases due to access to clean drinking water.
	+ Improved education and healthcare services due to reliable power supply.

**Economic and Social Benefits of Micro-Wind Turbines**

Micro-wind turbines can contribute significantly to local economies through job creation, improved economic activities, and enhanced quality of life. The technology also has positive impacts on education, healthcare, and overall well-being.

* Economic benefits:
	+ Job creation: micro-wind turbine installation and maintenance create employment opportunities.
	+ Improved economic activities: access to electricity enables households to engage in productive activities.
* Social benefits:
	+ Education: reliable power supply improves educational outcomes for children.
	+ Healthcare: improved healthcare services due to access to clean water and electricity.

**Challenges and Future Directions**

Despite the potential of micro-wind turbines, several challenges need to be addressed. Initial investment costs, technology adaptation needs, and community acceptance issues are major hurdles that require attention from policymakers and stakeholders.

* Recommendations:
	+ Policy makers should provide incentives for households to transition to micro-wind turbine technology.
	+ Stakeholders should support capacity building programs for indigenous councils to enhance their knowledge and expertise on watershed co-management.
	+ Community acceptance surveys and case studies should be conducted to document the process of transitioning to micro-wind technology.

**Closing Outlook**

The Sahel region is facing unprecedented climate challenges that require innovative solutions. Micro-wind turbines offer a sustainable solution for rural electrification and water supply, enhancing climate resilience and livelihoods. By leveraging indigenous councils' knowledge and expertise, watershed co-management can be implemented to address the region's critical sectors. Policymakers, stakeholders, and communities must work together to overcome challenges and ensure the long-term sustainability of micro-wind turbine technology in the Sahel region.

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Provide incentives for households to transition to micro-wind turbine technology.
2. Support capacity building programs for indigenous councils on watershed co-management.
3. Conduct community acceptance surveys and case studies to document the process of transitioning to micro-wind technology.
4. Develop policy frameworks that promote the adoption of micro-wind turbines in rural Sahel communities.
