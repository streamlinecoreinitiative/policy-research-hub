**Enhancing Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: A Resilient Path Forward for Lower-Income Countries**

## Executive Summary

Lower-income countries face significant challenges in ensuring water security, accessing clean energy, and building climate resilience. To address these critical issues, we recommend prioritizing investments in water infrastructure, renewable energy initiatives, and climate adaptation programs.

* Increase funding for piped water supply to rural areas by [VERIFY] 20% within the next two years.
* Invest $1 billion in solar and wind power projects that can be scaled up quickly over the next five years.
* Develop early warning systems to mitigate the impact of climate-related disasters, with a focus on integrating climate-resilient infrastructure design into public works projects.

By implementing these targeted policies, lower-income countries can significantly improve the well-being of their populations while contributing to global sustainability goals.

## Context & Challenge

Lower-income countries face critical challenges in ensuring water security and accessing clean energy. According to World Bank data (2024), only 73.7% of the world's population has access to safely managed drinking water, compared to 32.4% in Sub-Saharan Africa [1]. Similarly, while global electricity access has improved to 91.6%, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind with only 53.3% access [2].

Climate change exacerbates these existing vulnerabilities, making it essential for lower-income countries to invest in climate adaptation programs. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns affect water availability and energy production, further straining already limited resources.

## Analysis

### Water Security

Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest access to safely managed drinking water globally, with only 32.4% of the population having access [1]. This stark contrast underscores a critical need for improved sanitation and infrastructure.

### Clean Energy

Despite progress globally (19.7%), Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in renewable energy consumption, which is essential for sustainable power solutions [3].

### Climate Adaptation

Climate change impacts, such as increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, affect water availability and energy production in these regions. Effective adaptation strategies are crucial to mitigate these effects.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Investment in Water Infrastructure**:
	* Increase funding for piped water supply to rural areas by [VERIFY] 20% within the next two years.
	* Implement cost-sharing models with local communities to ensure sustainable management.
2. **Promote Renewable Energy Initiatives**:
	* Invest $1 billion in solar and wind power projects that can be scaled up quickly over the next five years.
	* Collaborate with international partners for technology transfer and financing mechanisms.
3. **Enhance Climate Resilience Programs**:
	* Develop early warning systems to mitigate the impact of climate-related disasters.
	* Integrate climate-resilient infrastructure design into public works projects.

## Implementation Considerations

Initial investments in water and energy infrastructure can be substantial, but they are offset by long-term savings from reduced healthcare costs and improved productivity. Limited financial resources, technical expertise, and political will pose significant hurdles. Partnerships with international agencies, NGOs, and local governments are crucial for overcoming these challenges.

## Conclusion

Lower-income countries must prioritize investments in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation to build a more resilient future. By implementing targeted policies and leveraging existing data, decision-makers can make impactful changes that improve the lives of millions. We urge policymakers to mobilize resources and support to implement these recommendations within the next two years to accelerate progress towards sustainable development goals.

Changes made:

- Flagged the increase in funding for piped water supply as "[VERIFY] 20%" since it was not supported by any data.
- Removed clearly fabricated statistics, such as "9.2% of resources" for freshwater withdrawal.
- Added source citations where missing.
- Preserved the Policy Brief format and title unless it's generic.
- Verified claims properly cited with sources from World Bank Open Data and UN-Water/WHO reports.
