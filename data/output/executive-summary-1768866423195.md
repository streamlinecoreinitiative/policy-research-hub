# Executive Summary

**Renewing Water Security, Lighting Africa’s Future with Clean Energy and Climate Adaptation**

### Executive Summary

This policy brief highlights the urgent need to address water security and energy challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. With only 32.4% of the population having access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1] and 53.3% accessing reliable electricity (World Bank, 2023) [2], these issues are exacerbated by climate change. We recommend prioritizing investments in rainwater harvesting systems, solar-powered microgrids, and climate adaptation measures to build resilient communities.

### Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant water scarcity and energy challenges that threaten economic stability and food security. The region's high vulnerability and limited resources make addressing these issues critical for development and social stability (World Bank, 2024) [1]. Climate change further compounds these challenges by altering rainfall patterns and increasing the frequency of droughts (NOAA, 2025).

### Analysis

Recent data highlights significant disparities in water and energy access. Only 32.4% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank, 2024) [1], compared to the global average of 73.7% (World Bank Open Data). Similarly, electricity access is unevenly distributed with just 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa having reliable power (World Bank, 2023) [2].

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Implement Large-Scale Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Invest in large-scale rainwater harvesting projects to augment existing water sources and provide clean drinking water for communities.
2. **Promote Solar-Powered Microgrids**: Support the installation of microgrid installations powered by solar energy, especially in rural areas where grid extension is costly or impractical.
3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Measures**: Invest in early warning systems and infrastructure designed to withstand extreme weather conditions such as droughts and floods.

### Implementation Considerations

- Cost estimates vary significantly depending on scale and local context. For instance, a solar-powered microgrid project in rural Kenya could cost between $250-$300 per household (SolarAid, 2024).
- Potential barriers include political instability, lack of coordination among stakeholders, and initial high capital costs.

### Conclusion

Addressing Sub-Saharan Africa's water security and energy challenges is crucial for building resilient communities. By prioritizing investments in clean technologies like solar-powered microgrids and climate-resilient infrastructure, the region can build a more sustainable future for its people. Governments must lead this effort with strong policy support and community engagement to ensure these initiatives are implemented effectively.
