**Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation: Strengthening Resilience in West Africa**

### Executive Summary

To address the pressing challenges of water scarcity, electricity shortages, and climate-related disasters in West Africa, we recommend investing in community-based water management schemes and renewable energy technologies. This approach will improve access to safe drinking water (currently at 32.4% in sub-Saharan Africa) [1] and increase electricity generation from renewables (only 19.7% globally) [2]. By prioritizing these interventions, West African countries can safeguard their development progress while meeting international commitments.

### Context & Challenge

West Africa faces severe challenges in accessing safe drinking water, with only 32.4% of the population having access in sub-Saharan Africa (2024: World Bank Open Data) [1]. The region's economy heavily depends on agriculture and industry, both of which are vulnerable to power outages. Climate change intensifies these issues through increased frequency of droughts and floods, leading to food insecurity and economic instability.

### Analysis

- **Water Security**:
  - Only 32.4% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa has access to safely managed drinking water (2024: World Bank Open Data) [1].
  - Climate change increases variability in rainfall patterns and intensity, leading to more frequent droughts and floods that deplete groundwater sources and contaminate surface waters.

- **Clean Energy**:
  - Renewable energy consumption accounts for only 19.7% of total final energy consumption globally (2020: World Bank Open Data) [2].
  - Electricity generation from renewables remains low despite subsidies and policy incentives in many countries.

- **Climate Adaptation**:
  - Climate change impacts such as temperature increases, erratic rainfall patterns, and sea-level rise threaten agricultural productivity, water resources, and public health (World Health Organization) [3].

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Invest in Water Security**:
   - Increase funding for water infrastructure projects such as wells, pipelines, and sanitation facilities.
   - Promote community-based water management schemes like cooperatives and microfinance institutions to finance these projects.

2. **Expand Access to Clean Energy**:
   - Invest in renewable energy technologies and storage solutions, including solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power plants.
   - Implement feed-in tariffs and other incentives to encourage private sector investment in clean energy projects.

3. **Enhance Climate Adaptation Measures**:
   - Establish early warning systems for climate-related disasters using technology like weather satellites, IoT sensors, and mobile apps.
   - Develop community-based adaptation plans that incorporate traditional knowledge on natural resource management.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Funding**: Mobilize international aid, domestic budgets, and private sector investments through grants, loans, and subsidies to finance these projects.
- **Capacity Building**: Train local officials and communities in water management, renewable energy deployment, and climate adaptation strategies.
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: Develop clear legal and regulatory frameworks for implementing the recommendations, ensuring accountability and transparency.

### Conclusion

By prioritizing investments in water security, clean energy, and climate resilience, West African countries can safeguard their development progress while meeting international commitments. Immediate action is needed to address urgent needs and lay a foundation for sustainable growth in the region.
