# clean cooking transition for peri-urban households in the Indus watershed: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Clean Cooking Transition for Peri-Urban Households in the Indus Watershed: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

**Executive Summary**

Climate change poses significant challenges to lower-income countries, exacerbating water scarcity and energy poverty. In rural Rwanda, integrating biochar-based agroforestry systems with renewable energy solutions can enhance both water security and sustainable energy access. This approach not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also fosters local economic development through the creation of new job opportunities in biochar production and forest management.

**Climate Change Impacts and Current Challenges**

Rwanda is highly vulnerable to climate change, with increased frequency and intensity of droughts and floods affecting rural communities. Climate change impacts on water security are particularly concerning, as existing water scarcity issues are exacerbated by changing precipitation patterns (UNDP Rwanda Development Report 2019). The inadequacies of current energy solutions, such as reliance on charcoal and firewood for cooking, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

* Current water scarcity levels: **Verification needed**
* Existing renewable energy sources used by rural households: **Verification needed**

**Biochar-Based Agroforestry Systems and Renewable Energy Integration**

Biochar improves soil quality and water retention, while agroforestry diversifies income sources for rural households. Micro-hydro systems and biogas digesters are cost-effective renewable energy solutions that can be integrated with biochar-based agroforestry systems.

* Benefits of biochar:
	+ Improved soil fertility
	+ Increased water retention
	+ Enhanced carbon sequestration
* Renewable energy options:
	+ Micro-hydro systems: **Verification needed**
	+ Biogas digesters: **Verification needed**

**Economic and Social Benefits**

This integrated approach can create jobs, reduce poverty, and improve overall livelihoods. Average income from biochar-based agroforestry systems per hectare is estimated to be $*** (Verification needed)**. Successful micro-hydro projects in Rwanda have been implemented, with *** (Verification needed)*** projects completed.

* Economic benefits:
	+ Job creation
	+ Increased income for rural households
	+ Reduced poverty
* Social benefits:
	+ Improved livelihoods
	+ Enhanced food security

**Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions**

To support the adoption of these technologies, governments should:

1. Develop policies to incentivize biochar production and forest management.
2. Provide training and capacity-building programs for rural communities on micro-hydro system installation and maintenance.
3. Establish a framework for biogas digester installation and operation.

Future research directions include:

* Investigating the long-term economic viability of micro-hydro systems in rural settings
* Assessing the impact of climate change adaptation projects on local biodiversity

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. Governments should develop policies to incentivize biochar production and forest management.
2. Provide training and capacity-building programs for rural communities on micro-hydro system installation and maintenance.
3. Establish a framework for biogas digester installation and operation.

**Closing Outlook**

The clean cooking transition in peri-urban households of the Indus watershed is critical to lowering emissions from critical sectors. Integrating biochar-based agroforestry systems with renewable energy solutions can enhance water security, sustainable energy access, and local economic development. Governments, international organizations, and civil society must work together to support the adoption of these technologies and address the data gaps identified in this brief.
