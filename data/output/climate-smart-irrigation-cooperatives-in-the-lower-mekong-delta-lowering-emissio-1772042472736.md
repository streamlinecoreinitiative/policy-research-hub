# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Lower Mekong delta: lowering emissions from critical sectors

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Lower Mekong Delta: Lowering Emissions from Critical Sectors**

## Executive Summary

Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in accessing safe water and reliable electricity, exacerbated by climate change impacts. To address these issues, we recommend establishing climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Lower Mekong delta region. These cooperatives will not only improve access to clean energy but also enhance water security through sustainable management practices.

Key Findings:

* Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage of population with access to safely managed drinking water (32.4%) compared to the global average (73.7%). [1]
* Access to electricity stands at 53.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa, far below the world average (91.6%). [2]

Recommendations:

* Establish climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Lower Mekong delta region, focusing on renewable energy sources and water-saving technologies.

## Context & Challenge

The Lower Mekong delta is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, including increased frequency of droughts and flooding. The region's limited access to electricity hinders economic development and exacerbates vulnerability during climatic shocks.

Background Information:

* Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity issues due to inadequate infrastructure for water supply and poor management practices. [3]
* Climate change intensifies these challenges by increasing frequency of droughts, flooding, and other extreme weather events. [4]

Why It Matters Now:

* Without robust interventions in both water security and energy sectors, Sub-Saharan Africa risks further socio-economic deterioration.

## Analysis

Water Security:

* Despite progress, only 32.4% of the sub-region's population has access to safely managed drinking water. This disparity is primarily attributed to inadequate funding for sanitation facilities, lack of proper infrastructure maintenance, and insufficient investment in clean water supply systems. [5]
* Climate change impacts such as increased temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and rising sea levels threaten water security in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Clean Energy:

* Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other continents in renewable energy consumption (19.7%), with most power generation coming from fossil fuels. [6]
* The region's limited access to electricity hinders economic growth and exacerbates poverty, particularly affecting women and children who spend more time collecting firewood or charcoal for cooking.

Climate Adaptation:

* Climate change impacts such as increased temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and rising sea levels threaten water security and energy supply in Sub-Saharan Africa. Without immediate interventions, these sectors will face significant disruptions.

## Policy Recommendations

### Water Security:

1. **Improve Access to Safe Drinking Water**: Invest in the construction of boreholes, rainwater harvesting systems, and other sustainable water sources.
2. **Enhance Infrastructure Maintenance**: Allocate resources for repairing existing infrastructure and upgrading facilities to ensure they meet current safety standards.
3. **Promote Efficient Usage**: Implement water-saving technologies such as low-flow taps and efficient irrigation methods.

### Clean Energy:

1. **Increase Renewable Energy Investment**: Redirect public funds towards renewable energy projects, focusing on solar, wind, and hydro power.
2. **Invest in Grid Modernization**: Upgrade existing electricity distribution networks to improve reliability and efficiency.
3. **Support Rural Electrification**: Focus on electrifying remote areas where access is currently limited.

### Climate Adaptation:

1. **Integrate Climate Resilience in Policies**: Develop climate-resilient water management strategies that account for projected changes in weather patterns and sea levels.
2. **Enhance Energy Sector Stability**: Implement measures to stabilize energy prices and improve affordability, especially in rural areas where access is the most critical.

## Implementation Considerations

* Initial investments will require substantial funding from both public and private sectors.
* Potential challenges include limited financial resources, bureaucratic delays in project implementation, and resistance to change by communities or government officials.

## Conclusion

Addressing water security and clean energy needs in Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for building a resilient future. By prioritizing evidence-based policies, we can mitigate current vulnerabilities and ensure sustainable development across the region.

Call to Action:

* Governments, NGOs, and international organizations must collaborate to implement these recommendations through targeted investments and policy reforms.
* Early action will not only save lives but also lay the groundwork for long-term prosperity in Sub-Saharan Africa.
