**Executive Summary**

Environmental resilience is crucial for lower-income countries to ensure sustainable development, reduce poverty, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. This brief provides an overview of key challenges and opportunities in water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation in these countries. It highlights the importance of securing adequate funding, developing strong policy frameworks, and engaging communities in decision-making processes.

**Section 1: Water Security Challenges**

Water is a fundamental resource for human well-being, economic development, and environmental health. In lower-income countries, water security challenges are significant:

* Current access to clean drinking water varies widely across regions, with some areas experiencing severe shortages (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program).
* Annual per capita water supply is often insufficient, leading to competition between domestic, agricultural, and industrial users.
* Basic sanitation facilities are lacking in many communities, exacerbating health risks.

**Section 2: Clean Energy Solutions for Lower-Income Countries**

Access to clean energy is critical for reducing carbon footprints and improving economic conditions:

* Proportion of population with access to electricity varies significantly across regions (International Energy Agency).
* Installed renewable energy capacity is growing, but still lags behind fossil fuel-based power generation.
* Average cost per kWh for rural areas remains high compared to urban areas.

**Section 3: Climate Adaptation Strategies in Lower-Income Countries**

Effective climate adaptation measures are essential for mitigating the impacts of climate change:

* Number of people affected by climate-related disasters is increasing, with significant economic and social costs (World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal).
* Percentage of GDP spent on climate adaptation is often limited, hindering effective response to climate risks.
* Proportion of agricultural land at risk from climate change is substantial, threatening food security.

**Section 4: Financing and Investment in Environmental Resilience**

Securing adequate funding is critical for implementing environmental resilience projects:

* Total public investment in environment varies widely across countries (OECD Environment Directorate).
* Amount spent on climate change adaptation is often insufficient to address growing needs.
* Private sector investments in green technology are increasing, but still lag behind traditional energy sources.

**Recommendations and Actions**

1. **Strengthen policy frameworks**: Develop and implement national policies and regulations that promote environmental resilience, including climate change adaptation and clean energy development.
2. **Increase funding for environmental resilience**: Allocate sufficient public and private resources to support environmental resilience initiatives, including water security, clean energy, and climate adaptation projects.
3. **Enhance community engagement and education**: Involve communities in decision-making processes and provide education on environmental risks and mitigation measures to ensure effective implementation of environmental resilience initiatives.

**Closing Outlook**

Environmental resilience is a pressing concern for lower-income countries, requiring immediate attention and action. By addressing water security challenges, promoting clean energy solutions, and investing in climate adaptation strategies, these countries can reduce poverty, improve economic conditions, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Strong policy frameworks, adequate funding, and community engagement are essential for ensuring environmental resilience and achieving sustainable development goals.

**Data Gaps Identification**

This brief highlights several data gaps that require attention:

* Lack of detailed data on specific regions or countries within lower-income categories.
* Limited information on the effectiveness of current adaptation strategies in real-world settings.
* Incomplete records regarding private sector investment trends and climate change policies globally.

Addressing these data gaps will be crucial for developing effective environmental resilience strategies and ensuring sustainable development in lower-income countries.
