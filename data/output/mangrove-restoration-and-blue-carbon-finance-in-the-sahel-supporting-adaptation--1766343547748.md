# Mangrove Restoration and Blue Carbon Finance in the Sahel: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs

## Executive Summary

The Sahel region is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing severe water scarcity, desertification, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Integrating mangrove restoration with blue carbon finance can provide a sustainable solution for climate adaptation, enhancing both water security and renewable energy use in lower-income countries.

## Introduction to Water Scarcity

Climate change has significant impacts on agriculture in the Sahel region, including erratic rainfall patterns and reduced water availability. Traditional irrigation methods are energy-intensive and costly, exacerbating economic challenges for smallholder farmers in vulnerable communities.

## Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

Existing irrigation systems in the Sahel region include boreholes, canals, and traditional rainwater harvesting methods. However, these systems often result in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage, exacerbating food insecurity and economic instability for smallholder farmers.

## Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience

Agroforestry has been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing erosion and increasing water retention. Studies have demonstrated the potential of agroforestry systems to enhance water availability and reduce soil erosion, but specific benefits (e.g., 30% increase in water availability) require verification.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

Micro-hydro technology involves using small-scale hydroelectric systems to generate electricity. This approach has several benefits, including reduced reliance on diesel generators and increased energy efficiency. However, careful consideration of site-specific factors is necessary when implementing micro-hydro systems.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

Pilot projects have demonstrated the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro for climate-resilient irrigation. These projects have shown significant reductions in water loss through evaporation and seepage, but specific results (e.g., 50% reduction in soil erosion) require verification.

## Policy Recommendations

To support the adoption of integrated agroforestry and micro-hydro systems at scale, policymakers should consider the following recommendations:

* Provide financial incentives for smallholder farmers to adopt sustainable irrigation practices.
* Develop and implement policies that promote the use of renewable energy sources for irrigation.
* Establish training programs for extension agents and farmers on the installation and maintenance of micro-hydro systems.

## Closing Outlook

The integration of mangrove restoration with blue carbon finance can provide a sustainable solution for climate adaptation in lower-income countries. Policymakers should consider the recommendations outlined above to support the adoption of integrated solutions that enhance both water security and renewable energy use.
