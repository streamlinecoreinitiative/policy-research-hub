# climate-smart irrigation cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: supporting adaptation targets in NDCs

**Climate-Smart Irrigation Cooperatives in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Supporting Adaptation Targets in NDCs**

**Executive Summary**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the most densely populated and vulnerable regions to climate change, facing severe water scarcity that threatens food security and economic stability. This brief proposes integrating agroforestry and micro-hydro systems as a solution to address these challenges. By combining sustainable agriculture practices with renewable energy, this approach ensures economic benefits, sustainability, and climate resilience.

**Section 1: Introduction to Water Scarcity in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta**

The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is critical for agriculture, with millions of farmers relying on irrigation systems to sustain their livelihoods. Climate change has exacerbated water scarcity, leading to reduced crop yields and economic losses due to more frequent droughts and floods.

* Climate change impacts:
	+ Temperature increase: [verify] 1-2°C over the past decade (source needed)
	+ Precipitation variability: increased frequency of extreme events (droughts/floods) (source needed)
* Importance of resilient irrigation methods for food security and economic stability

**Section 2: Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges**

Existing irrigation systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta are often inefficient, with significant water losses due to evaporation and seepage. Boreholes and canals are common practices, but they require substantial energy inputs and maintenance.

* Water loss percentages:
	+ 30% evaporation (source needed)
	+ 5% seepage (source needed)
* Challenges in existing irrigation systems:
	+ Energy dependence
	+ High operational costs

**Section 3: Agroforestry’s Role in Climate Resilience**

Agroforestry practices have been shown to improve soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into agricultural landscapes, farmers can reduce erosion, increase water retention, and promote more efficient use of resources.

* Benefits of agroforestry:
	+ Soil conservation
	+ Biodiversity enhancement
	+ Carbon sequestration (source needed)
* Case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving water retention and reducing erosion

**Section 4: Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency**

Micro-hydro technology offers a sustainable solution to energy dependence, providing clean power for irrigation systems. By harnessing the energy potential of small rivers and streams, farmers can reduce their reliance on diesel generators and increase energy efficiency.

* Benefits of micro-hydro systems:
	+ Reduced energy costs
	+ Increased energy independence
	+ Environmental benefits (reduced greenhouse gas emissions)

**Section 5: Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply**

Pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems. By combining sustainable agriculture practices with renewable energy, farmers can ensure a reliable water supply while reducing their environmental impact.

* Economic analysis:
	+ Cost-effectiveness (source needed)
	+ Potential for scaling up

**Actions/Recommendations:**

1. **Support policy development:** Encourage governments to incorporate climate-resilient irrigation cooperatives into NDCs and national policies.
2. **Scale-up pilot projects:** Provide funding and technical assistance to expand successful pilot projects, promoting the adoption of integrated solutions at scale.
3. **Capacity building:** Offer training and capacity-building programs for farmers, extension workers, and policymakers to ensure effective implementation.

**Closing Outlook**

Climate-smart irrigation cooperatives have the potential to transform water management in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, ensuring a climate-resilient water supply while promoting economic benefits and sustainability. By integrating agroforestry with micro-hydro systems, farmers can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, increase energy independence, and enhance their livelihoods.
