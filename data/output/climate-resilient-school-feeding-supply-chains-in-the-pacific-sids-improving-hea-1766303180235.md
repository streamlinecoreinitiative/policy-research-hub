# Climate-Resilient School Feeding Supply Chains in Pacific SIDS: Improving Health Outcomes in Heatwaves

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, health, and economic stability in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Pacific. Severe heatwaves, droughts, and erratic rainfall patterns exacerbate water scarcity, impacting agricultural productivity and the availability of nutritious food for schools. This brief explores the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into climate-resilient school feeding supply chains in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt.

## Climate Change Impacts on Food Security in Pacific SIDS

### Introduction to Water Scarcity

*   The Sudano-Sahelian Belt is one of the most water-scarce regions globally, with climate change exacerbating existing challenges.
*   Erratic rainfall patterns have led to crop failures and reduced agricultural productivity.

### Current Irrigation Practices and Challenges

*   Existing irrigation systems (e.g., boreholes, canals) are inefficient and often reliant on diesel generators.
*   Water loss percentages from these systems range from 30% evaporation to 5% seepage. [Verify]

## Agroforestry's Role in Climate Resilience

*   Agroforestry improves soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while enhancing water retention and reducing erosion.
*   Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving agricultural productivity and resilience.

## Micro-Hydro Systems for Irrigation Efficiency

*   Micro-hydro technology offers a renewable energy source for irrigation systems, reducing reliance on diesel generators and increasing energy efficiency.
*   Benefits include reduced operating costs and improved water management.

## Integration of Agroforestry and Micro-Hydro in Climate-Resilient Water Supply

*   Pilot projects showcase the combined use of agroforestry and micro-hydro systems to address water scarcity and improve agricultural productivity.
*   Economic analysis highlights cost-effectiveness and potential for scaling up.

## Policy Recommendations and Future Research Directions

### Key Data Points Needed

1.  Average Annual Rainfall in Selected Regions (e.g., Nigeria, Chad) [Verify]
2.  Specific Water Loss Percentages from Existing Irrigation Systems [Verify]
3.  Cost Estimates and Financial Viability Analysis for Agroforestry-Micro-Hydro Projects

### Needed Evidence Snippets

1.  World Bank Report: "Renewable Energy Consumption in West Africa" (latest report), focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).
2.  Local Survey Data: Results from surveys conducted within the Sudano-Sahelian belt to measure community acceptance and benefits derived from integrated agroforestry-micro-hydro systems.
3.  NOAA Climate Dataset: Rainfall patterns over the past decade for specific regions within the Sudano-Sahelian Belt (e.g., Nigeria, Chad).

### Needed Evidence

1.  NOAA Climate Dataset: Specific regions in the Sudano-Sahelian Belt (e.g., Nigeria, Chad), focusing on rainfall patterns over the past decade.
2.  World Bank Reports: Renewable energy adoption in countries with similar climatic conditions (e.g., West Africa), focusing on renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).

## Actions and Recommendations

*   Governments and development agencies should prioritize the integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into climate-resilient school feeding supply chains.
*   Further research is needed to address knowledge gaps in economic impact, community acceptance, and scaling up.

## Closing Outlook

Climate change poses significant challenges to food security, health, and economic stability in SIDS. The integration of agroforestry-based micro-hydro systems into climate-resilient school feeding supply chains offers a promising solution. By addressing water scarcity through sustainable irrigation methods, this approach can improve health outcomes, support economic stability, and contribute to the achievement of SDGs 2, 6, and 13.
