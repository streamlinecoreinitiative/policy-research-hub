**Enhancing Environmental Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: Water Security, Clean Energy, and Climate Adaptation**

## Executive Summary

To address the pressing environmental challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend investing $10 million to $20 million per project in sustainable water infrastructure projects, such as rainwater harvesting systems, boreholes, and wastewater treatment plants. This investment will not only improve access to safely managed drinking water but also enhance climate resilience by reducing the region's vulnerability to droughts and floods.

## Context & Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing severe environmental challenges, including inadequate water security, low electricity access, and limited clean energy sources. As of 2024, only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population had access to safely managed drinking water (World Bank), far below the global average of 73.7% (World Bank). The region's renewable energy consumption at [VERIFY] 9.2% of total final energy consumption (World Bank) underscores the need for innovative solutions that can bridge this gap while ensuring sustainable development.

## Analysis

Water security remains a critical challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa, with only [VERIFY] 32.4% of the population accessing safely managed drinking water as of 2024 (World Bank). This disparity is particularly acute given that globally, access stands at 73.7% (World Bank). The limited availability and quality of clean water resources hinder economic growth, public health, and social stability. Additionally, electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa remains uneven, with only [VERIFY] 53.3% of the population enjoying adequate power supply (World Bank).

## Implementation Considerations

- Cost estimates for implementing these policies range from $10 million to $20 million per project based on scale and complexity.
- Potential barriers include initial high costs, technical challenges in implementation, and resistance from local stakeholders due to entrenched traditional practices.

## Conclusion

Sub-Saharan Africa's environmental resilience is pivotal for sustainable development. By focusing on water security, clean energy provision, and climate adaptation strategies, governments can significantly improve the livelihoods of millions while laying a foundation for long-term prosperity. Immediate action through targeted policy interventions can accelerate progress toward SDG 6 targets and broader climate goals.
